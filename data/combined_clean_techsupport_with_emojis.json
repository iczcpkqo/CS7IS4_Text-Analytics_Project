{"text": "Why don't printers ever work? I'm not trying to do double sided collated color photographs, I'm trying to print regular ass documents without issues. I have an He Envy 5014 that has functioned properly in the past. Now whenever I print it looks like html or something. Says things like obj, identity, endobj, filter, flatedecode. What is this crap? Do Brother or Epson printers have less issues because I have had nothing but headaches from He and I am fed up. I don't want to have He smart or have to constantly update drivers or have to worry that the next version of windows is going to make my printer obsolete. I just want a printer that prints. I recently updated to windows 11, could that be part of the issue? Please help.  I haven't updated in ages so I don't remember if the update install screen is meant to look like this. I used update assistant if that happens to change anything.  So i want to run a program automatically when a usb is plugged in the pc but i cant find something that works. Does someone know how to do it?  I am really ignorant, and I need to get rid of Nueva. if it takes a professional, let me know. It is driving me crazy as I cannot search google for anything now.  Is it even possible to upgrade All in One Px Lenovo IdeaCentre C540 with low DP Xeno (e. g. E3-1260L, 45 W DP) CPUs? I tried to Google this everywhere without success. There is an Intel H61 chipset. The max CPU it came with was i5-3330S, DP 65 W. And is known it can handle even stronger i5 and i7 (e. g. i7-3770S), but what about Xeon? Just from the point of possible whitelist or unsupported by IOS. I read comments below this CPU list /H61_Express. html) and it is not clear. Some H61 boards run Xeno without problems, some need IOS update find any for this Air C540 mob), some With low DP Xeno, heat is not problem. And there is still a possibility of whitelist. I don't want to put a lot of money in it, I found that cheap 1260L on local market. Or I can go with i5-3470S with the same (too high but capable) 65W DP. But don't want to stress the weak power cascade too much.  i got windows 10, with the most recent update i was given. my graphics driver is up to date according to before experience, my ssd and adds function as they should according to windows and /scannow command in cmd also finds no violations. neither my antivirus or windows 10 built in virus scanner find no malicious programs, and i have not downloaded any suspicious ones or visited websites that could and probably would get me 10 trojans or something. however my pc keeps crashing. i randomly get a bluescreen which restart my pc, and i for the love of all that is holy, cannot figure out why. my current suspicion is that it could be firefox. firefox has been crashing on me constantly, just when i logged in to make this post it crashed. could this cause blue screen of death? i currently have firefox in safe mode, but it still crashed like i mentioned. and yes, i have deleted cookies and history from the browser but it did nothing.  ive had these problems for so long and have tried so many different things to fix them. nothing has worked. i have tried 4 different monitors and multiple cables, ive also tried every port on the 2080ti with no luck. i have videos of whats happening but cant post them here. CPU: i9-9900K 3. 60Gz. PU: TX 2080ti. AM: 32Gt. Of:Windows 10 Home. Motherboard: AUS i believe, kinda forgot . Monitor: AUS 165HT connected with display port.  does anyone know why for instance i have a very loud video made on movie but when i save it to camera roll it becomes quieter?  Is there any way to replace or scrub the thumbnail that's automatically given once a file is created? . I tried using a program, from github, called exifcleaner. This program literally scrub all metadata before you can even see the metadata, as soon as you upload the file through it. However, it doesn't scrub/replace the thumbnail. Because I can still see it clear as day in My Pictures folder. I want the thumbnail to be gone or blanked out. Say, is there a way to do this through Windows 10 Of?  so just this morning when i decided to play a game, the game wouldnt load so i did what any other person would do and attempt to load up task manager and close it from there. then i was greeted with windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. you may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item. ive been struggling with this for about 5 hours now and i am completely stamped.  Here's what I'm referring to:.  Computer was working great the night before. Came in the morning to this on the screen. Is that an evil frog? . The computer technically works but has this image burned on the screen. Possibly some surge overnight although no flashes on the cameras or anything. Power cycle does nothing. Even disconnected the CD panel from the All-In -One. As soon as the power turns on, this is on the screen. Anyone have an idea of what happened?  So as the title says I wanna know how windows was activated on its own. I was having issues with an old SD that I had activated windows on. I decided I was gonna get rid of it and do a clean install of windows on a new SD. When I was setting up the clean install it was asking me for my windows key and I decided to skip it as I didn't have one a the moment and I didn't remember the old key. Everything was set up as brand new with a new email and everything and without me putting in a key. However, out of no where it just said my windows was activated despite me never putting a key in on this fresh install. This is not so much an issue but I'm just curious as to how this is possible. I never linked anything and I never typed a key in at the set up stage yet its activated. Also, the computer I'm using is one I built id if that matter but just throwing that out there. If someone could explain this to me I would greatly appreciate it! :).  Dear all,. I am not able to open few emails (old emails) from Online Archive in outlook. This problem is appeared since few month. When I select the email I have a error message (Sorry, we're trouble opening this item. This could be temporary etc. ). Many thanks to your help.  I realized today that my SB hub (7 ports) was only plugged in loosely (like 50%) to the port of my laptop since last week. I have ext DD, controller, speaker, and cooling pad plugged to the hub and for some reason the laptop was still able to read data from ext DD. But I noticed my laptop was hotter than usual in the last couple of days, have I damaged something or am I just paranoid? Mod if you remove this post again then you're racist or something.  I tried Google first, but finding something that addressed this exact situation was difficult. If I send an email in gmail to a group of people, and person B responds to me and a couple of CC'd individuals, and then I reply all to them but add another person will that person I added see person B's reply to my initial email?  So I installed windows on a new drive but nothing opens anymore. (Upgrading drive). All my drives and files are there but nothing is How can I use my old files.  This started off only happening when I was playing games and it stopped when nothing was running now it happens soon as I turn my pc on with nothing running in the background all day can someone help me fix this.  My situation: . I have a triple screen (3x DisplayPort 1080p/60Hz) work from home setup, running off of my personal desktop. My new job sent me a laptop that they want me to do 100% of my work from. I have no issues working from the laptop, but I want to use my triple monitor setup (that is why I purchased it). Considerations:. 1. 2. monitors inputs: each 1DP, 1VGA, 1xDVI-D. 3. Laptop output: SB-C. 4. accessories: webcam, wired keyboard, wired mouse, SB mic, and speakers (4x SB, 1x aux) . I've come to a few potential solutions and I need to know which of them are preferred/possible: . 1. buy a 2:3 DisplayPort KM. Looking at about - likes. 2. buy a 2:2 DisplayPort KM, keep on monitor dedicated to my Px, and (using a laptop river) position the laptop screen so that, when open, it acts as a third screen. Not sure on price range for this. 3. buy a 1:1 DisplayPort KM, connect my pc and laptop to the inputs and place a 1:3 DisplayPort ( Multi-Stream Transport enabled) splitter on the output. The splitter would then route to each display. Question: will this option would allow me to maintain 1080p/60Hz on each monitor? . I understand that each solution will necessitate the purchase of various cables, but the goal is to come to the most affordable, workable solution. What are your thoughts?  I installed both Dolby Access and TS unbound but when i click on or literally nothing happens , there is a popup the showing and shutting fast. Windows 11.

Hey, I have a recurring issue where my laptop will die within a few seconds of starting it up, if I then switch it on it will but the screen stays blank, and the keyboard doesn't light up and I have to force shutdown again by holding the power button down before restarting again. It kind of stopped for a while but has started doing it again, so I have to start my laptop up 3 times every time I want to use it. Any idea what could be causing this? . specs are.

Hi, what do 1st line support technicians do if they're totally home based? Surely the job is even more limited / easier if you are home based? What problems do you get from users usually?  My google pixel three's ability to charge has been deteriorating for a while now and it has finally kicked the bucket. It used to charge at certain angles and it seemed to work especially well if something was pressing down on the male usb-c port. Looking online seems to only give the advice to clean out your port for dirt with a toothbrush, but when i plug a charger into my port it only goes in maybe 3 quarters of the way in. It doesn't in like it used to, there's still maybe half a centimetres of metal that I can see when it's pushed all the way in irrespective of which charger I use. Is there anything else I could try to resolve this issue as it's stressing me out a bit? Any help is hugely, hugely appreciated :) .  I can't keep my pc on overnight, and I absolutely cannot lose my download progress as my internet speed is really bad. So I was wondering if FM keeps that progress even after a shutdown. Thanks in advance.  Kaspersky antivirus notified me that someone logged into my Kaspersky Kaspersky tells me their application is mozilla and they're on a kai linux operating system.  Hello, so i upgraded my ram from 8gb to 16gb but after I ran task manager I saw that 8gb ram is Hardware Reserved and it's only using 8gb instead of 16gb ram. The system detects that I have 16 Gt installed and bios says that too I checked cpu-z and it said the same. I did everything what I can find on the internet i tried it but it still didn't worked.

For the last couple of weeks microsoft powershell will pop-up randomly for like 2 seconds and it'll stop the thing I'm currently doing on my computer close it the screen and then I have to go back into the task with the hope it didn't crash. is the exact problem I'm having but I've tried the suggested methods but when I try to attempt anything in actual powershell it stops me from creating any changes, it says I don't have the authority but I'm the only account on my laptop. But what's even weirder is that Microsoft shell will still interrupt what I'm doing in that same app.  So, I want to group a bunch of my mk files by tags (like season 1, 2, movies etc. ). But I can't find any way to actually add tags to mk files, it isn't showing up on my details tab of the file properties, i need help to try and fix this. I've been banging my head trying to solve this for a few days. Thanks.  so back in July I got a Cyberpower C1500AVRLCD to make sure my computer isn't fried, as the room it's in has a history of electrical problems and it's the only place I can put it due to there not being enough space in my own room. It's now March and it gave me and keeps obnoxiously, which indicates an overcharge. It would happen occasionally but it got more frequent recently to the point where it overcharged three or four times in a day. So, I've chosen to unplug my entire rig until I get this issue resolved as I can't afford a new Px atm. Should I buy new batteries for my PS, buy a new PS, not use a PS but instead a regular surge protector, or move my Px somewhere else?  I've installed Parted Magic as I have a portable Sabrant rocket pro SD that I want to erase to sell. It's an NVMe drive. When I click on erase disk icon in Parted Magic the only SD it can see is my laptop's built in hard drive. Also an NNMe drive. When I click on the partition editor icon in Parted magic it CAN see the Sabrant drive. But it also says it's not mounted? . So I don't know why its not visible in Erase disk? . I've paid for Parted Magic as as far as I can see Sabrant don't have a disk erased tool built into it's SD management software to erase SSD, like other brands like Samsung do. Not sure what to do about erasing the disk. The Sabrant is connected via SB C and has a blue light on. So I don't know if I need to mount it maybe? And if so how? . Thanks for reading.  I recently got into Px gaming. Had my buddy help me build a beef rig and I'm running on the Samsung Neo G9. I purchased the side stroller Limbo from steam and when I was playing I say my PS counter hover around 1200 PS and would often spike to 1300+. Is this normal for games that don't need to render much? Should I cap my fps with Rival tuner? Help.  Hi folks! . I'm not into everything hardware-related, so I'm just gonna post my experience here, hoping for someone to recognize this problem. I've build a pc now for over 3 months. Everything runs smoothly, no problems what so ever. I got a new CPU and a 1060 gpu. Last week when playing C:Gt, I noticed an odd lagspike every 5 seconds, which continued for a few minutes, until my game freezes and crashes. I restart but the same thing happens over and over. I thought it might be the server, so I decided to play a game of League of Legends. Same thing happens here: 5 minutes of ok gameplay, then sudden lag spikes and a crash. I look at my task manager but nothing very weird is going on there (although my PU usage weeks around 95% when only playing C:Gt Facet, which I think is high). So I'm like okay, there's probably something wrong with my hardware, but after a few hours my girlfriend told me she had the same problem (her pc is in the same room). This means it's probably my internet, right? But does internet problem cause your entire pc to freeze? . Thanks in advance for everybody taking the time to read this.  When I wake my Px from sleep and watch any kind of video (youtube, twitch) the video will begin to lag behind the audio and desync. The time it takes for it to be noticeable drops to a matter of seconds if I have a game running on my main monitor. This issue is apparently nonexistent when I am operating from a clean boot. It only happens when I makeup from sleep. I just wanna know why this happens. I don't really wanna have to shut down and reboot every time i wanna use my computer but it isn't the end of the world.  Basically I just downloaded a file from cuttly that seemed very shady. It was sent from a friends discord so it wasnt suspicious at first. But then my defender popped up and the zip file in the browser said something like failed - Virus It was greed out and its not in my download folder. Did I dodge this bullet?  I've had this problem ever since I built this computer a couple years ago (vid card is only new device). My pc will slow down to an absolute crawl when certain things happen. Open task manager and the mouse will lag like crazy, speed up, lag, speed up, lag until the task manager is open. Joining a Weber or Teams meeting makes my computer go into der mode. If I'm in a Weber or Teams meeting, and I or someone else shares content, my computer tags again and my audio becomes electronic. I have:. Intel i9 9900K. Asks Maximus X Hero. 32gig AM. SSD. 3080ti.

I've been doing this for the last 5 years and never had issues until I built this new Px. Does anyone have some thoughts?  Hello! . I have a dell G3 Laptop that I got in 2019, which I use primarily for school work with occasional light gaming every couple of months. Within the last week I've noticed that the battery while unplugged has been draining incredibly quickly, usually just lasting over an hour from full charge, while only running programs such as Microsoft office and chrome. Normally It would last a few hours, but even with low brightness and battery save the battery life is drastically reduced. Any help is greatly appreciated Thank you.

My dad was able to order replacements for it, but when i turned it back on, I noticed small black spots all over the screen. How do I fix it? .  So my printout earlier was faded, installed a new cartridge, printed blank, bought another one, blank. Tried all the maintenance options, reboot, etc. Then i looked inside and on the right under where the printhead goes when not in use i noticed this ribbon covered in ink. Printer is an hp 6978. Should that be like that? Or is my printhead maybe just sitting over there dumping ink out onto that instead of on the paper?  So i messed up on trying to fix it, but its just some registers that fell off. I made a solder mess too, trying to go off a guide but i screwed it.  I was just on Google Maps with a friend on Discord, when I first heard some scary and echoing notice on my headset (pretty loud). At first i was a little bit shocked and didnt know where it came from. It sounded like a voice but i couldn't understand anything. I asked my friend and he definitely said that he wasnt it and i also trust him (hes not the guy to do such things). So i checked my Firewall and my Files and it said everything was Okay. I didnt think about later on and just continued. Then (about 30min later) it happened again. My friend did already leave and i was alone. But this time it was much scarier and i was very shocked because it was so unexpected. I just threw my headset (carefully )and turned off the Px. I dont know what happened. I've never heard about something like that and never experienced it before. Some infos: Windows 10, newest updates installed, usually I dont have problems with my Px and work a lot with it, the audio lasts for about 20seconds.  install failed . I tried a variety of distros like Ubuntu and Manjaro, but every time, the installation of GRB fails. On my Acre laptop, I currently have Windows 11 and Manjaro dualboot, which works without any problems, but on my Asks laptop, it just always fails and doesn't boot into linux. I have an ext4 partition which is my root partition and a 35 B large AT32 partition, which I want to use as my boot partition, but I can't boot of it for some reason. The only time it boots, is with the SB-stick I made with Rufus in Windows. I just don't know why it just doesn't want to work. Please, I really need help. Thanks in advance for every answer.

Hello, . My lawyer is trying to send me links with a specific email address, and nor me nor my bf are receiving them. My bf saw the email in his inbox once, and next time he checked it wasn't there anymore. What's happening? . It's pretty important and the lawyer says the problem is on our side. I find it unlikely as me and my boyfriend have different email providers (gmail and a french one) and yet the same pm. Thank you!  I was playing on my Px then all of a sudden out of nowhere my Px turns off. after a few seconds, then turns back on again but no display or lights on keyboard and mouse. I tried to just shutdown the Px and waited a few minutes to turn it back on, but then a red light showed up on the motherboard. I tried to do the MOS battery trick, but didn't work. I took out the PU and placed it back in after five minutes, still the same problem. Can someone please help me?  So I just built my first gaming pc, and tried to get the ram to run at 3200mhz.

Any help would be appreciated.  I have an He 6978 printer. It keeps giving me an error message that says Jam: Remove any jammed paper and make sure the paper tray is installed However, there is no paper to jam in the printer.

Ive been able to install Windows onto the new drive using a different Px- the drive boots absolutely fine on that Px, so its not the SD.

Any ideas?  android 9 PLEASE i am desperate for help i deleted accidentally my dim file (almost 8 gb storage) and while it wasnt there anymore and while my search for some recovery centers i accidentally take a photo which CREATED THE dim file am I screwed and now the file got overwritten? PLEASE help ? , .  I had Windows 10 installed with Ubuntu on dual boot, however one day the GRB screen stopped showing up and the Px just booted straight into Windows, as it would do normally. It was pretty upsetting because at this point I couldn't use Ubuntu. Now, when I turn on my computer it ALWAYS first boots into IOS. I have to power off and power on the computer at least 3 or 4 times before it finally starts up Windows. I tried a clean and complete reinstall, formatted all the hard drives but to no avail :/ I reset every setting in the IOS to default but it didn't help either. What could be causing this?  Recently I bought a new gpu. The first few days everything was perfect but now whenever I put any kind of load on it my screens go black and I have to reset my Px. Does anyone have a clue what could be happening and possible solutions? The gpu is 3060 SI Gaming X, my mob is b450 I Porous pro wifi. My psu is fractal design ion sfx 650w 80+ gold.  I'm planning to upgrade the system drive in my desktop Px to a 4To SD. Only problem is my current drive is partitioned using BR. I know I'll have to convert to GT to utilize the full size of the 4To drive and I've checked to unsure that my motherboard supports EFI. So my question is about the steps/order of operations for mirroring my current system drive to the new SD and converting to GT without data loss. I've never done this before but this is my best guess about how to do it. 1. Connect both drives. 2. Mirror my old system drive to the new 4To drive. 3. Convert the new 4To drive to GT. 4. Restart into IOS. 5. Select the new drive as the boot drive. 6. Enable EFI. 7. Done? . Is this right? Or should I boot to the new drive and then convert it? . Is AOEMI Pro the best tool for this or is there a free alternative? . Thanks!  I want to change my Windows username, as I'm trans and want to switch it to my preferred name.

I am trying to figure out what could be the issue of this/ fix it before it gets any worse. Please can anyone help me out? . Uploaded a YouTube video of the issue.  I have a Windows 10 Lenovo laptop with an MD Ryzen CPU. I was using it normally when the screen went blank and laptop went to sleep. I pressed power button and at boot I was presented with an error screen, talking about fTPM error, apparently this has something to do with Ryzen CPUs. The error started like this: . Press Y to reset fTPM, if you have Bitlocker or encryption-enabled system, the system will not boot without a recovery key. Press N to keep previous fTPM record and continue system boot. I pressed No first time, and got a message about pin being unavailable on the windows sign in screen. Rebooted and got the same fTPM error, so I pressed Yes this time since I dont have Bitlocker or know what that is, and thought I didnt have an encryption enabled system, got the same message on windows sign in, and get it every time I boot the computer now, but I no longer get the fTPM error since pressing Yes. On normal windows sign in screen I get this message your pin is no longer available due to a change to the security settings on this device. Click to set up your IN again. I click to set up pin and and it says Just a moment and spins for 5 seconds. Then it just shows me the same error again saying your pin is unavailable bla bla bla, and clicking set up pin never works just does the same thing. So Im stuck on sign in screen unable to set up a new pin cos its just glitching. I tried to boot in safe mode didnt work, tried to reset windows settings to a restore point didnt work, tried to use the boot menu from holding f8, nothing worked. What can I do?  I have been getting very low 1% and 0. 1% PS numbers that cause stuttering, when otherwise getting a solid 60 PS . It's across multiple games, my 1% and 0. 1% lows are like 5-25, while I can maintain an PS at above 60 and even average PS remains high. Thinking maybe it's something wrong the the CPU or MOB? But I cannot buy another MOB or CPU just to determine this. Using SI afterburners none of the hardware is usually even above 70% usage when this happens. (Monitoring AM, CPU (all cores), and PU) Temps essentially never get above 60 c. Userbenchmark and HWinfo show my AM clocked at different MHz though. see below. I have noticed that AM clock doesn't go over 2000 MHz though, when in game using SI Afterburners would this make that big of a difference? . It tends to happen more frequently when in urban areas, or when there are multiple in an area/battlefield (be it a strategy game, or PG etc. ) Although this is not always the case as it happens otherwise as well. So far I've noticed it in Assassins Creed Odyssey, Fallout 4 (vanilla and molded, though molded is somewhat worse), Total War Warhammer 2 and Area 3. I should upload a picture of the Odyssey benchmark, it's anywhere between 90PS and 19 on any settings. So average says around 60 but low goes to 19 the chart makes it very obvious. Specs: .

As I type this, Task Manager says 30% of my AM is being used but the only thing really using anything is Chrome at 500 B.

Thanks in advanced, I feel like I've been thrown back into the dark ages!  Randomly my pc turns of periferals I think it's a problem with my motherboard. I have a x570 master and a ryzen 7 5600.

Hello everyone, i'm looking to find how network priority works on w10 when you have 2 different network. Basically, my desktop is on a wired, strong (low ping, 1gb/s) connection and i want to have a wifi network connected to my phone on mobile data (4g) for when i play online games if at some point my house's internet have an issue. So i have my rj45 connected on my computer's mob, and a wifi adapter connected on the pc through usb. If i have the 2 networks active, but set the rj45 one on highest priority, will windows only use the network, and go on the backup one only if the main one goes bad ? . The idea behind this is to always have my backup but never used when until it's not necessary, to always have the best connection on the game and not draw mobile data usage when not necessary. ITA.  Ram : 4x 8gb DR4 3000. CPU : Afd Ryzen 5 2600. Ram is currently running at 1866 Hz. When i try to set the Amp settings it wont boot, CPU ED is on. How do i get a better frequency ?  Hey,. Ive been messing around with OS studio for a couple weeks now and Im still struggling to have consistent resolution in my recordings. I would often find the resolution to be absolute garbage when Im moving around in a game while at the same time have the resolution be ok when Im standing still. Note that I already have the base canvas resolution at 1920x1080 and the same for the output scaled resolution. I also have a 1660 super with a i7 so I should be able to run these settings just fine. Please help!  Hi everyone,. I recently bought some new parts for my Px. After installing them, I noticed that my Wi-Fi was much slower (25maps plan, only getting max 3maps download, but normal upload speeds). I decided to go ahead and reinstall windows, which fixed my problem. A few days ago, I booted up my pc and it went into recovery mode, and while the boot drive would be recognized in the IOS as a storage device, I could not select it as a boot drive. It wouldn't even show up in the list. I decided to reinstall windows again after this, and it took some trial and error, but it finally was reinstalled and was bootable again. I have two problems now. The first is that my Wi-Fi is again only getting a max of 3maps download most of the time. I had some success running the trouble-shooter yesterday, which fixed it for a while until it reverted back to 3maps. I have ran some ipconfig commands in the MD which helped for a bit before it went back to being slow. I have also went into the device manager and reinstalled the adapter, and changed power settings, but nothing has changed from that. When I run speed test on my phone right next to my Px, it gets around 23-25maps, as it should. My Px seems to be the only device in the house that is having trouble. My second problem is my booking. When I booted up earlier, it went straight to IOS and didn't recognize my SD as a boot drive once again, but it would still recognize it as storage. I was able to finally get it to recognize it by skipping the IOS and choosing it straight from the boot menu at startup, but I would like to keep this from happening again, as it is a hassle having to keep reinstalling 80+ Gt games and all my programs when it happens. Any help is appreciated, thank you!  Currently have a printer hooked via usb to a mini Windows Px that I'm basically using as a print server. I have the printer shared and I am able to add the printer. I have it set up as print client side. Everything seems to work however the page sizes I'm having issues.

If I try to print 11x17 it prints on letter size without scaling. I'm at a loss. I've tried coping all printer settings on the laptop and also installing other drivers. Nothing seems to work.  Hi,.

Hello, I have a Thinkpad T480 with one M2 slot and a 256Gb SD that I switched from a ATA SD previously installed. The space is getting tight so I got a 1Tb drive.

Hi guys, Anyidea how to fix this? Everything is fine with the Px, I tested with another monitor. This is what happening:.  Just bought a new rebuilt gaming Px. I notice that all fans appear to come on except the one in the very back. Px runs fine and stays cool as-is, just not sure if all fans normally come on at the same time? Or is it normal for them to function more independently? . Thanks.  My friend updated to Windows 11 and he immediately got the new File Explorer with fancy minimal icons at the top. Meanwhile, after I updated, I still have the old File Explorer. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I tweaked my Windows 10 before with some third party programs like CustomizerGod and 7+ Weaker. Is there a way I could refresh the registry or check for file integrity to get the new Windows 11 File Explorer? It's one of the main reasons why I got Windows 11.  Hi, I'm having issues with either my PU or the monitor. I have an SI Optic G271 144 Hz 1 ms Freesync A monitor, Gigabyte 2060 Super Windforce OC 8 Gt PU, Ryzen 5 3500X CPU, and Cooler Master 650W SU. I am seeing horizontal lines across the monitor on the top half or top quarter of the screen. The monitor has 2 DMI and 1 De slot while the PU has 3 De 1 DMI slot. Currently, I have exhausted all De slots in the PU, as in, in whichever slot I put the cable, the issue remains. However, after several tries with DMI slots, after a while, the screen turns somewhat normal. You can see from the images . At first, I checked the monitor with a laptop and it seemed fine, but recently I read similar issues with SI monitors so I am not sure. When I first encountered this, my solution was to switch to other De ports and unplug/plug the PU. This was fine for a week or so. Then, all the De ports stopped displaying the same stuff so I moved on to the DMI which was fine for a month or two. Now the issue is back. I read some stuff about allowing either the card or the monitor to heat itself which makes the lines disappear which I didn't try but seems hilarious (I accept that this started in the winter and happens almost every cold start but come on). I tried updating to the newest drivers as the issue was at first not driver-related, it did not start after a driver update or anything. I did DD in safe mode (which did not show any lines and worked perfectly for some reason at 1080p) and installed the latest. For a day it solved the issue. The next day, they came back. Colorful EFI screens were fine as well. At this point, I ordered a new PU and will MA the card if I can. I need to filter out the monitor again, however, I do not have an option to test the De ports in the PU or Monitor. Encountering the same issue with DMI may or may not filter out the De issue. I do not know the electronics behind the DMI/De board/chips on the monitor or PU. I will also blow out the dust and use another 8 pin connector/rail on SU. I am open to other suggestions as well.  I found a phone I want to buy but I can't buy it through my provider If I bought it would I still be able to use my sim card.

Hey guys,. i bought 6 months ago a new 4k Lt To and used it the last weeks not really much, because i was not at home. Now i wanted to watch yesterday, and i recognized that if i watch the mandalorian with the disney+ app, there are irregular flashing white pixels - but the weird thing is, that it seems to happen not always. If i watch something on youtube, there are some videos where this happens too, but some, where it doesnt. So obviously i think it cannot be the app, and also probably not the software because i also resented the tv to default. From my point of view, it often happens on 4k media, but im not quite sure, if it follows a principle. Can anybody image, what it could be? I googled yesterday, but wasnt able to find anything like this. See you and thanks in advance! .

Just got a new PU, but swapping it out has turned into a challenge for some reason. I DD uninstalled the drivers for the 2070 it was replacing, and shut down the system. Swapped out the PU, and when I started it up the system isnt giving any kind of video output, either from the GPU or the new PU itself. Same when I take out the new PU, no output from the GPU still. Its clearly booking, I can hear the Windows login chime. When I replace the old PU, the display outputs as expected again as if nothing was wrong. Ive gotten the new PU replaced, as I thought maybe it was DA. But today I received the new one and it is also exhibiting the same issue. So clearly something is wrong with my system, but I dont know what. The only potential issue I can think is my 750w SU is not sufficient for the PU, but that wouldnt result in a black screen while the rest of the system boots just fine. Interestingly, the system isnt booking completely, as my Splashtop connection is not restored after the Windows boot chime is heard.

Since I don't believe there is a setting to manually change it in the Hoku settings. I believe it needs to be done in the router settings. (Correct me if it is possible to change it directly from the Hoku, though). So in my Netgear router settings I see were I can change my entire Network's NS, but I do not want to do that. I just want to change it on a specific device. This led me to believe I needed a static In of the device. I then proceeded to find my device on the network and under AN setup I could setup an Address Reservation for the specific Hoku device. But now I don't see where in the router settings I can change the NS from this created In Reservation. So how can I complete this setup and get a static NS on my Hoku device? .

I do have port open on the SB 3 adaptor to DMI. Since I have video going through that port or would it better to have a different hub that I can add another connection to the SB C port?

I've been using an old Alienware Aurora R3 for 3D modeling which it had been handling well for a few months and then started freezing or crashing randomly. A few days ago it crashed and got stuck in a repair/startup loop. Eventually I tried reinstalling the operating system (Windows 10) via SB. I didn't delete any partitions or files but just selected the primary drive to reinstall the os on. The first two times I tried doing this it crashed halfway through the setup process (when it asks for microsoft account, customized features, etc. ) and the third time it crashed right at the end of this process. At this point I thought I'd have to do a clean restart so I removed the drives and backed them up, but when I put them back in the computer started up great and brought me to the fresh operating system with my old files intact in a windows. old folder. I started reinstalling my old software and getting everything setup when it crashed AGAIn and started the startup loop all over again. I'm going to do a clean install now but I'm wondering:. 1. How do I actually do a clean install properly? It brings me to this window but I'm not sure which partitions to delete/format or how to go about this: photos of partitions and . 2. Will this even fix the issue? Why did it crash right away even though I had successfully reinstalled windows 10? Is there anything I should do after installing the os to prevent crashes from happening again? .

So I have a job interview in a week, and it's on teams, they've sent me an invitation but it doesn't look like there's a link on it, I can add it to my teams calendar though. Do you think I should ask them to send a link? Or do you think one will come through closer to the call date? I don't wanna reveal how dumb I am before I've even got the job.  I could not find any information online. Has anyone had any experience with this before?  I have a chromebook laptop which i usually just do my revision on but i occasionally load up games like rocket league and fortnite to pass time as they're playable with low settings on my specs. When I have background apps, e. g. spotify and youtube, open when playing fortnite/rl I usually get around 60 fps when in creative or freeplay and my cups always on 100% (which is expected as its dual core+thread), when I load up my game with all background apps turned off I struggle maintaining even 30fps and when I check my cpu usage in task manager it says its on 100% cpu usage but the clock speeds are dont go higher than 1. 6gh and average around 0. 70gh (my laptops always charging when gaming). The temperatures seem perfectly fine, with the vega 3 graphics usually staying below 65 degrees and cpu temps around 60 degrees, I don't understand why it downclocks itself.

I know, as a android user I should not use 3rd party cleaner apps such as clean master, cc cleaner etc. But what about the in-built device care feature, it also claims to performance. So the question is should I use it or not. Also how much of an impact will it have if I use it, . and it also as features like auto battery save and auto restart, any insights on those? . (for reference it's a samsung mobile).  On March 21 2022, I opened my Px after 2 days of not using it. I got a screen telling me finish setting up your or something along those lines, but I guess that's not important to the discussion. Then Windows told me that an update is available (I usually do updates manually). I went to Updates History and it said that some updates got installed successfully on 21/03. I have no idea how those updates got installed, since I didn't do them manually and my Px was opened for about 5 minutes on 21/03. As far as I know, Windows Updates is set to Hello, I recently bought some honor earbuds 2 lite, but when I listen to music at low volume it is noticeable with a sound similar to static, it is somewhat uncomfortable to hear that sound.

Thank you so much.  Am stuck on bios screen. What should i do.  Hello,. I have a Alex Media server setup on an old Px (Dell Optiplex w/2nd-gen Intel i5, 8tb AS DD, 256gb ssd boot drive) and am looking to move my server into a newer Optiplex for the transcoding benefits on an 8th-gen i7. I have roughly 5tb of media contained on the AS hard drive in the old Px. How would I go about transferring my library? Would it be safe to simply unplug the boot drive and DD and slap them in the new Px?

I was just listening to music through a pair of wireless headphones when the audio suddenly started coming through very glitch, like I was hearing it through a wind turbine. I tried turning them off and on again, disconnecting and reconnecting, and eventually managed to fix it by disconnecting the headphones and then having my phone forget them before pairing them again. This got rid of the choppiness, but now the sound from the headphones is very muddy. The headphones are called titanium by aftershokz and Ive had them for one or two years now and nothing like this has ever happened to me. Is this a common issue with these headphones, and is there any way to fix it?  I recently got my 2070s back from an MA through AUS. I reinstalled the 2070s, replacing my old 1050ti I was using as a placeholder. After installing my card and ensuring everything is working right, I tried to launch AUS Armory Rate, which was giving more trouble than I felt it was worth. So, I attempted to delete the software. Ever since I removed this software, my computer hasn't been running right. I've been having a multitude of problem. 1. My file explorer just won't load sometimes. 2. I pretty much can't download anything without where ever I'm downloading the item from freezing and crashing (chrome, steam, EVA lighting software, just to name a few). This problem isn't consistent however, I can still download games through the Epic Games launcher for example. 3. Chrome won't open sometimes, but other browsers like edge and Firefox work perfectly fine. I even just tried to swap back to my 1050ti to see if that would fix it, even tough I figured it but that was one of the only changes made to my computer since this problem has started. I even tried jumping back to a restore point from the day before I put the 2070s back in.  I would love for anyone with experience to help figure this out - . Link ( ) is what the consistent ping/packet loss test from my laptop's wifi connection is. Resetting the router doesn't fix the spikes, and it isn't a problem on my other laptop (comparison link ) .

Hey so i am just wondering how would i be able to cool my cpu properly since i get 88 C in the bios. Can i put thermal paste between my cpu and the is? Or is there some special thermal paste or something i need to buy to cool my cpu again.  The dock works fine in all other aspects. I've tried two different A adapters on it, both meeting the voltage and current requirements of 19. 5V and 3. 5A respectively. The dock requires power for the SB ports to work, so I know it's getting power as the SB devices connected to the dock do work fine. Also, the power led on the dock next to the charge port is lit up. This laptop doesn't have a standard barrel charge port, and only charges through a SB-C power adapter. That works fine. Unfortunately the dock blocks the SB-C port, so there's no way to use the SB-C charger with the dock connected, otherwise I'd just use that as a workaround. But regardless, I don't see any reason why the laptop shouldn't charge from the dock. The laptop shows it's on battery only (vs. plugged in and not charging). I've gone through the IOS looking for any relevant options, but couldn't find anything that made a difference. If I can't get this dock to work, my next step would be to get a SB-C/Thunderbolt dock. But I'd rather avoid that if I can. This dock is supposed to work with the laptop, according to He's website.  When this shows up, I'd press those buttons and then it would get stuck on bios screen, td? I'd turn it off and after a while it would boot normally. After a while, the cycle repeats. Pleeeaassee help.  Hello Techsupport people,. Thank you for existing! I've already looked through a lot of other people's weird sounds on this sub, and none match my weird sounds. I've got an Asks Laptop that's about 3-4 years old a low-end gaming laptop). The past few months, it's been randomly making a variety of high-pitched whining sounds. They're not it seems very random. The sounds last from a few seconds to a few minutes. My fan doesn't make a lot of noise, but is audible if my computer is running anything requiring a lot of resources, and it sounds pretty normal and separate from the whining. I'm primarily running my laptop for work/school, which is generally just using the internet (Chrome), and Word/Excel. On Windows 10, up to date. Performance looks fine according to the task manager (Disk, Memory, CPU, PU) all within optimal/acceptable parameters. Here are 2 recordings, the first is a lot more audible (kind of a The second is today, it's quieter but shiny. Thanks in advance!  Ok so I was on my computer trying to go on Google when I noticed that my wifi wasn't working, I tried to reconnect but it didn't work so I thought a simple restart would fix it. But here I am 2 says later stuck in a dreaded repair loop. I've tried everything I could find on the Internet like using chkdsk, bootrec commands, registry backup(I didn't have any values so I couldn't do it), etc. I even tried booking into safe mode and that wouldn't work. I was wondering if anyone had some possible solutions that have worked for them. I also have a few questions. 1. If I reset my Px and choose the keep files option, will all my games, apps, and undervolting I've done be deleted, or is there atleast a folder where I can recover my apps from? . 2. Is there a way for me to go into the bios and fix it there (I don't know how to get into bios). Any help is appreciated, also I have an Acre Nitro 5 A515-51 if that helps.  There's a particular website - that my laptop simply won't ever load properly.

It's a website i use regularly (both casually and professionally), and having it partially blocked by my laptop is causing me serious problems. i would appreciate any insights as to how to solve this problem. i've spoken to the web manager and he just says it must be something to do with javascript being blocked. Perhaps he's right - but by what? ! . In case it's relevant - i'm using Windows 10. i'd really appreciate any help to resolve this!  Does anyone know if a brand or product that will allow me to put a 5G IM card into a SB dongle it's aligned with unlimited 5G that I'm not using and I really would like to have internet on my laptop but hotspot data just doesn't do the trick.  So I just got a pc and the lights on the fan will turn off for a second every once in a while. The fans keeps spinning though. Should I be worrying about this?  So i got recently hacked by a virus so i dont know if this would relate to the problem but when i had the virus in my pc it had tried to login into all my accounts and ive been getting alerts of them trying to, but when i try to change my password i dont get a verification code on my messages or apple id email at all would the hacker have done this? . Px- my mail and messages are working just fine but im not receiving verification codes or certain emails.  After I did a hard shut down (since the computer completely froze), my Px did not boot any more. I have the Of (W10) installed in a SD and after I checked boot order and stuff the thing just doesn't boot. Tried disconnecting, changing ATA cables leave for some minutes without power and nothing seemed to work. The disk is detected in the IOS, but it just doesn't boot.

Recently got new ram but did not realize I got different speeds at 3200 when my old was 3000 but they are same brand and model and size stick but even after I boot up bios and change amp and ddr4-3000 task manager still reads 1500 across all 4 sticks when it should just be running the slower speed of 3000.  Is it possible to install any of the modern video door bell systems to my existing older door bell system? I have been reading that I need to know what voltage mine is using, but I can't locate the transformer anywhere in the house. I have looked in all the possible places suggested in my Google searches, but nothing. I have not yet checked the attic. I might invest in a Circuit breaker and accessory kit to trace the lines at least.  When I woke my Px (Windows 10 Pro) from sleep this morning, there was a PowerShell window with a bunch of characters typed into the command line. Largely repeated sets of the start and then a few other repeated characters afterwards. Screenshot: . This looks too unlikely to be a stuck-keyboard behavior.

A strange squiggly line app has appeared under Startup Apps on my Windows 10 laptop. (look to the right, bottom row). Sometimes it manifests as Chinese-looking characters. As you can see, Task Manager displays nothing of the sort. I have run all the scans Windows 10 has.

As title says, I have been using my Px without windows for quite some time. I trusted a friend of mine who put a version of windows on my Px and the little dialogue in the bottom right of my screen has been gone for a couple months. Sweet, I thought. I can actually change my wallpaper etc etc. WEL, Now I'm having a bunch of issues and I'm going to suck it up and just buy windows like a normal human being and I want to start fresh. I dont care about losing everything on my Px, I just want to erase everything and have a clean install of REAL windows. Can I get some help? I was told all I need to do is just plug the SB in my Px, boot from IOS and select the SB as the boot option and follow the steps. Is it that simple?  Hi,. I've got a ssd and I have a had with windows. I don't want to lose my files nor want to backup. Can I install windows on the ssd and just keep the Had windows as if nothing happened? Booking on the ssd and just losing those Gt on the had? . If so, how do I do it? . Thanks.  Hey. My wifi is living its own life as it turn itself off completely out of the blue. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. I have followed pretty much every step i can find on google and youtube to try and fix it, but nothing works. I have tried to install the newest drivers but it doesnt work. One trend i have noticed is that the Wiki shuts itself off and wont start again, is when the battery is low and/or I have turned the pc off. Any suggestions? . Thanks.

I haven't upgraded the computer since last booking TA V (worked flawlessly then) about a year ago. I decided to try playing TA5 for old times sake and realized that the game was terribly slow. Yes, it is THAT slow. The PU fans don't seem to run while running the game. Tried playing CGO, C3 and fans turned on. Still nothing for TA5 and it is unplayable. MOB bios is updated, GEFORCE drivers updated, optimized settings for TA V. Any suggestions? Anything would be appreciated. Thank you! .  I'm thinking of switching back to Linux. When I got a more powerful pc I moved back to Windows because I figured Linux gaming wasn't quite there yet, but I checked and all the games I play save for 1 run fine under Linux, but I also want to be able to switch back to Windows easily if I run into a problem I can't fix. I was wondering if there was an easy way I could backup my drive to my AS, and easily restore later if needed.  I have low quality and low sound. I front headphones port is broken so I have to plug the headphones at the back. The sound was shit just like it is now at pop os until I switched it from line in to headphones with realtek audio console. I tried had jack retasking but it keeps giving me a resource or driver busy error. Thank you.  I tried font paw and it just recovers photos, videos and some other But I want to recover a whole folder I recently deleted. Thank you.  Hello. Recently I've bought this disk :. G-Technology G-DRIVE 10 To Enterprise Classe 7200 PM, 245 B/s, con SB 3. 0. it worked well with Windows 10 and even with 11,but since when I've re-installed Windows 11,it stopped to be recognized correctly. I mean,on the device manager I can see that it is working correctly and it is shown under the name SB SCS Disk Device driver file version 10. 0. 22000. 1 (WinBuild 160101. 0800) and it has been mapped as Local Disk (H:),but it says : space 0 bytes free space 0 I tried to attach it to a lot of different SB ports and SB controllers,but it didn't work anymore. Usually for the SB disks I shouldn't install a specific driver. And anyway,the company G-Technology hasn't one. What should I do to fix it ? And yes,it works well under different Ones,like Linux and FreeBSD.  I'm on mobile (Android device) and was browsing SpankBang. It's considered by many to be a safe site but while browsing it i got redirected to a site which URL i cannot recall (i was using incognito mode so search history and cookies were erased). Now, i don't exactly know if it was a forced redirection or if i accidentally clicked an ad. I think i was able to close the tab before it fully loaded but i'm not sure. So, considering all that, how at risk am i? How should i proceed?  I bought point to point (tp-link cpe210) antenna recently and it seems like i bought the wrong thing. I have super slow internet connection and thought that 4g antenna would fix my problem.  I have 3 storage devices in one Px: an NVMe M2, an SD, and a Data DD. The NVMe M2 has windows installed on it. The SD and DD are combined using MD StoreMI. This has all my data, music, and videos on it. If I reformat my NVMe M2 and reinstall windows will my data on the SD/DD remain intact? Will StoreMI recognize it on the newly installed windows 10?  So i open up my laptop,it takes much longer to open,looked like it was stuck on the preparing Windows,the welcome page and when it opens up almost all my desktop icons are gone and nothing at all is on the bar,why?  I've been trying to figure this out for a while with no success but my usb stick that's supposed to be 32gb doesn't seem to have much storage and was hoping i could find an answer here (not sure if i used the right flare). It has 28. 8 Gt available but I'm just trying something else and will update this afterwards.  Hi Guys,. Here are my tech specs of what I'm running. - 2 X 240hz A2721D Monitors. - 1 X 175hz A3427De D-LED Monitor. - Ryzen 5950X CPU (With a Tech-N water block). - Asks RG Strip 3090 (With an En water block). - Asks Dark Hero Mother Board. - 32Gt (4 X 8 Gt) 3800 mhz L 14 G. Skill Trident AM. - 3 X Samsung 980 Pro 2To . - Corsair A1600i SU. - Custom loop for cooling (With En Pump). As I'm running quite a beef set up what is my best bet for power? Should I just use a high quality power strip with surge protection like something from Belkin? Or should I invest in a PS? . The main issue I have is that my Px is roughly 3 meters / 10 feet away from the nearest wall socket. Unfortunately the Belkin Surge protectors only come with 2 meter lens cables as far as I'm aware. When looking for ones with a 3m or longer cable I'm only finding lower end basic stuff. So here are my main questions:. - Does anyone know of a good surge protector that could handle all my hardware safely with a 3m cable or longer? . - Would a PS be the way to go? If so what brand / model of PS would you recommend based on my system configuration. - If I do get a PS i doubt the cable would be 3M long. So how would that work? Would I plug the PS in to the wall socket, and then connect a power strip with a surge protector to the PS? Or would I do it the other way around and connect the PS to a surge protector? . Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm going crazy trying to find something that would have a 3m cable lens or longer and also keep my Px (Which took me years to afford) safe and powered. Thanks in advance!  . My battery says its on 1 percent but it always says its plugged in but also the battery says it is not charging. how to I reenable charging again.  I uninstalled Honka (14 Gt additional resources downloaded) and downloaded it back again after a month but it keeps on saying to extract resources needed by no matter how much i redownload it.  I see a orange light on my mother board. I turned of monitor and pc for 15 min and got a asks utility screen. Tried restrtung several times but still the same screen til i got no signal DMI.  We use a PN to connect to the company network. With some internet providers we can connect to the PN but cant access the other devices in the local network. Any idea why that could be? People using the same internet provider we have in the office have this problem mainly. This problem kinda popped up a few weeks ago without any changes in the system.  Hey everybody, been scratching my head about this since i built this computer, I was hoping someone could help me. Problem is most games I play and 3D Mark Timespy all crash with a full screen color of vaguely what color was on the screen at crash. Regular use hasn't caused a crash so far. Doesn't matter how hot or stressed the PU is, and it can happen in 10 minutes or hours. The only software I've found doesn't consistently crash is Doom Eternal, (which is running off Vulcan API) and Minecraft with shades. I've reinstalled drivers with DD, tried a different version of Windows, tried reinstalling Windows (LTS 2019), tried one stick of ram, tried downclocking a little, and I'm totally stamped. The only reproducible crashed I've gotten is Ellen Ring to consistently crash after i walk about 8 steps from loading in. If I don't move, nothing happens. Here are specs:. Ryzen 5 3600. Eva TX Titan X Hybrid (Maxwell). Gigabyte B550m De3H. Eva Supernova 650W. Sk Hynix 3200mhz ram from a rebuilt . Thanks for looking.  Hi! . I have a He notebook. Intel i5, 8gb AM, 1Tb He with integrated Intel 520 graphics. The thing is, while watching videos on LC , Youtube, Netflix, widowed or full screen, everything works fine but every couple of minutes, there is a spike in PU 3D reaching 100% for about 20-30 seconds. During that time, everything slows down to a crawl, the sound gets out of sync, and the video sometimes pauses itself until the PU comes down to a 10% normal use and everything resumes playing. Its really annoying. I've tried the common solutions: update windows, update intel drivers, disable hardware acceleration in chrome, etc with no luck. Well, I hope anyone can point me in the right direction. Thanks!  So i have 25maps download speed but when i go to download some it caps ant 3maps and doesn't go higher than that. How do i fix this?  I need help with clearing the c drive. I've already went and deleted alot of stuff in the temp file, but it hasn't done anything.  I have tried everything. The headphones work well but the mic doesn't even show and can't use it.  Im trying to record something from cassette.  This pop-up is so annoying. Any tips how to fix it? I cant find any setting to disable only Word as game but the whole thing.  I purchased a subsidized laptop through Disabled Students Allowances and for some reason they partitioned my C drive and created a usable partition for files and stuff, but I constantly ran out of C drive space so decided to merge the partitions. I haven't had it long and didn't have much on the additional volume so it wasn't a problem to just wipe it and merge. Except now every time I load up the laptop it gives me the not error for the desktop file on the original partition, and I can't figure out how to point it back to it's original file on the C drive rather than constantly looking for a volume that no longer exists. It's not causing any real issues aside from being annoying every time I try to save something it points to the deleted volume Documents folder instead of the C drive one, I'm just a bit confused how to finalize this I guess! . If anyone has any tips on what I'm missing, I'd really appreciate it!  Let me preface this by saying this is a problem I have never encountered before. The internet connection going to my computer just drops randomly and very often. This causes problems with things like loading youtube videos, logging into certain SO services, games that require some sort of initialization process that involve connecting to a server. It does not hinder larger downloads on something like steam though, or even streaming a video once it has begun the suffering process. Only the initial loading is affected. The cable going to the computer from the houses switch is known good and no other computer on the network is sharing this issue. It is specific to my single set up. I have:. - Reinstalled windows thinking that it could have been some sort of registry key error. - Reinstalled the latest IOS for my motherboard. - Removed the MOS battery and then reinstalled the latest IOS again. I am at a loss for what could be causing the problem at this point. I fear the most likely cause is a hardware fault somewhere on the motherboard itself, but I don't know how likely that is. Any ideas on what I could try to fix this would be appreciated! . Important Px specs:. Windows 10 (Downgraded from 11 when I reinstalled windows). RG STRIX B450-F GAMING. MD Ryzen 3600.  I recently tried out a few keyboards and noticed that if I had more than one plugged in they both worked fine until the computer sat idle for too long or went to sleep. Then only one would work. I got a new ttl keyboard and a Bluetooth number pad and the same thing is happening. But weirdly enough the calculator hockey works but the numbers dont. Then it works fine after a reboot for a few hours. Microsoft Bluetooth Keypad.  Hi guys, I'm pretty familiar with Px stuff but I'm stamped here. I've been trying to connect my Airpods to my Windows Px, and even though I can pair them, I'm not given the option to actually use them as an audio device. I've tried restarting after pairing, re-pairing them, as well as updating Bluetooth drivers. I'm running a pre-built Px, the ABS Gladiator. Thanks in advance!  I can't use backspace or any of the top letter words when I use something like it will take me to settings how do I fix this.  I dont know if this is the good place to ask . I got this friend who always text me at the same moment I open my phone. I dont understand how they can know Im on it. It also happens when I have all of my apps closed and I never let any social media know when I am active. Is it a coincidence?  So i built a new pc (my first ever build) and when i turn it on, it keeps restarting. I've tried switching out the rams, sometimes it stops restarting when i turn it on (but doesn't boot) sometimes my keyboard lights up, sometimes it doesnt, but it never gives signal. Any ideas of what could be the problem?  I recently got new pc parts, a motherboard, cpu and ram. Ive had a few blue screens So far. I get the Page Fault in Non-Page Area. and IRL_NOT_LES_Of_EQUAL . But Google for both errors lead to AM issues. I just recently did a memtest86 with both ram sticks, no errors. Doing 1 stick atm but it will probably be the same. I ran Prime95 for several hours and received 1 error no warnings on every tab/window on it. It said fatal error something 488k FF. I think. Is there a chance my cpu is the problem or did memtest not pick up the error?  I can't stop it from downloading so i put on a speed limited on it. How should i stop it? and where did all 35 Gb go? It wasn't like this before, after on week i turn on my computer and open glass wire after an hour to see 35 of my limited internet traffic gone. How can i fix this problem? I already stopped BTS and windows updates from services but still not fixed.  I have a Macbook Pro (2016) and two Dell monitors. I use two separate dongles to connect my laptop to the monitors for a total of 3 displays (the two monitors and the laptop itself). 90% of the time it works fine, but sometimes I will wake up and see that only one of the monitors is detected and working, and it is always the one I plug in first. By swapping the cables I swap which monitor is the working one, but I can't get them both to work at the same time. A restart solves this, but I was wondering if anyone knew the core issue.  I don't know where to ask this, as there isn't a subreddit about this app or proper customer service, so I hope this isn't the wrong place to ask.

Background:. On March 1st, my employer went paperless. Unfortunately, the staff are having a hard time with it. Data keeps being moved / deleted, my accident.

This change is only needed for one network share, the rest can operate as normal. Server: Windows 2016 Standard. Client: Windows 10 Pro.  I have an Acre aspire 3. It came with windows 10, but could upgrade to Windows 11, which I did. However, I don't really like it because a couple of the programs I use regularly are not fully compatible with Windows 11. The in settings is greed out and says it is no longer valid, and a reset through troubleshooting just re installed Windows 11, so In thought I would just download the windows 10 install media from Microsoft and install it that way but I can't find a windows 10 product key. There was no sticker, no product key card in the box the laptop came in. Surely there must be some way to find my old Windows 10 product key to install Windows ?  Something weird just happened. So I unplugged the monitor and for some reason, the power button is still flashing. I'm sure it's unplugged, and I kept it like that for seconds, then I moved the plug a little bit and suddenly it stops linking. Is there any explanations for this? Or is it some r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix shit?  This isn't necessarily an important issue, but I noticed on my work Px that my ram usage is always extremely high. This Px is a Lenovo Thinkcentre with an i5, SD, and 16Gt of ram. As I type this the only things I have open are 1 tab of Firefox, Outlook, and Task Manager, and my memory usage is at 63% (10. 1Gt/15. 9Gt). I've tried using Task Manager obviously but it doesn't show what the culprit is, and I've tried using rammap in the past but I have no experience with the program so I'm not sure what exactly to look for. I assumed it was the work of the antivirus (SentinelOne), but even after talking to higher ups in regional In, they seem to think that's not the issue. Basically, I want to know what's using a shit load of my ram, because Windows won't tell me.  So I have an external hard drive for work and I need to encrypt it. When I go to start the encryption it says the username or password is incorrect. There isnt any password at that point so Im lost. I have a 1 To seagate. Any idea what could fix it?

However after about a month or so I'm back to where I was before with even less wiggle room to remove things. I've had to do this around 4 times now and it's starting to concern me.

So yesterday I wanted to go back from Windows 11 to Windows 10 while keeping my files, I wasn't using SB but the installer, but something seemed strange because there was no customization and there was a black screen all the time I thought I wouldn't move anything and it would do itself, at some point the computer restarted and the login screen appeared, but the username was and I wasn't able to login or anything like that, I thought I would just make a SB bootable device on my old laptop with Linux running on it, so I got the SB ready but now I realized I couldn't enter IOS by pressing key, there was no motherboard logo and if I clicked correct key I would just get a black screen, so I held shift while clicking restart, got to troubleshoot options and edit firmware settings but just black screen again. At this point I remembered that Linux have sort of like a preview version so maybe I could do something, so I unplugged my SD and plugged Linux SB and it booted to Linux installer but now I can't plug my SD back and I can't install Linux without it, I searched web a bit and I found out that the problem of IOS not opening was Fast Boot option but my motherboard manufacturer don't have support for Linux.

So i just bought a Belkin Power Strip with which can supposedly withstand a power surge of up to 525 Jules. However the cable lens is only 2 meters (roughly 6 feet). But the nearest outlet I have to my Px is about 3 Meters away.

Hi, this morning my phone fell half into the water but the upper part is ok(speaker fine), the phone is working fine I cleaned it and dried everything I could, it's not charging when I plug it in and I have a notification on the phone that says it's connected to something and it's charging it.

Tried searching but keep finding esters that appear to require the cable to be terminated. I saw some that have alligator clips, but none really say the cable does not have to be terminated. I tried testing them before by terminating the cables. My tester was telling me they are not the same cable. The problem is that I don't know if they are not the same cable or if I did not do the termination correctly. The tester works as I tried it on an extra cable I have. The cable I need to test is in the wall and is with some home theater cables that appear to go from my wall to the wall above the fireplace. There are two ethernet cables at the wall and two above the fireplace, so I assume they are the same. It seems like the best way to test them would be with a tester that can test the cables without them being terminated. Is there a tester that I can attach to the loose wires of the ethernet cable? If so, which one should I get or what should I look for in a tester so that I know which one to get? . Thanks.  My Mac 18. 2 is getting image retention. Is this a sign of a dying display?

I have tried all the things suggested in related posts and it didnt get me anywhere. I decided on booking in safe mode to make a back up of my files but safe mode wouldn't allow it (? ). Amongst the things that i tried are:. Regular troubleshoot. Windows recovery (safe mode wont allow it).

Thanks!  This might be a very required request but I've been assigned to look at a Facebook group and look into some data. The problem is it's a huge group where it can get like 10-20 posts a day. Unfortunately, I can't sort out Facebook posts in a group by months/days so I have to manually scroll to reach to a specific month. Here's where the problem kicks, when I keep on scrolling, chrome runs out of memory (It uses around 3-4 Mrs, which is fine but it just crashes), I have 16 gigs of ram and using Ryzen 5600g as the processor. My guess is it crashes because of too much data being loaded on a single tab, so I wanted to ask you people is there anyway when I scroll way down a group chrome or any browser won't crash? Or is there an extension through which I can clear all the scrolled page? . Thank you.  Acre i5 with He Graphics 3000. The size of this duplicated strip has been slowly growing over the past couple of months and is now approximately half the size of a browser tab and is starting to impede selection of items on the taskbar.

Hi all, I have this weird issue in some of the games that I play. When I play F1 2020 or Forza Horizon 5, the screen sometimes flicker once. After it flicker, PS would significantly, and it would feel a lot worse. For example, before the flicker, I would get around 250+ fps on F1 2020, but after the flicker, it would go to 144 fps, with the lows feeling like around 60ish. This happened to both my previous gpu (Powercolor Red Devil 6900X) and current gpu (EVA FW3 TX 3080Ti). In both instances, I used the latest driver, ensuring the previous driver was removed using DD before installing the newest drivers. My specs are as follows: Gigabyte Torus Pro Z690. Intel i5 12600k. Corsair h150i pro 360mm radiator. 32Gt DR5 Data PG. EVA FW3 TX 3080Ti. EVA Supernova G2 750W SU. Some things to note: PU/CPU temperature are by no means high, with CPU being at around 60 degrees while PU is at 80 degrees HOTSPOT temperature. After the flicker, PU usage remains as per usual (running at high clockspeeds with power consumption same as before). As the PS for both games go to around 144fps after the flicker (which is the refresh rate of my monitor), I would think it is something to do with this. Would appreciate any feedback/help if anyone has experienced this before. Thank you!  I have a Win10 laptop that continues to go to the Lock Screen, and disable the Wiki adapter whenever the lid is closed. Ive already changed the settings to Do Nothing for the Choose What Closing the Lid Does. Ive also changed the Power Management settings for the Wiki card to always be enabled. Anyone have any tips for keeping the laptop always On, even when the laptop lid is closed? Basically I dont want the laptop to Lock Screen whenever the laptop lid is closed for a certain amount of time, and would like the Wiki card to ALWAYS be on even if the laptop goes to Lock Screen on Sleep mode. Backstory: we have a user who uses Citrix on their laptop and whenever they close their laptop lid, it will lock the screen and disable the Wiki. So whenever they open up their laptop, it takes about 30 seconds for Citrix to reconnect, and the user isnt very happy about this.

I've been playing the game for a while now and I always suffered with occasional micro shutters. It wasn't until recently when I had task manager open whilst playing that I realised it was using my integrated graphics instead of my PU. I'm playing on a laptop, I have a TX 1050, but when I launch Sea of Thieves, it uses my integrated and not my 1050. I have opened the NVIVIA control panel and set Sea of Thieves to use the high performance graphics (1050), this worked immediately after but a couple of days later, when I've come to play again, it using the integrated again, despite the settings being the same. I have opened the windows graphics settings and told it to use the 1050, still no joy. I've manually reinstalled the latest drivers, still no joy. I have spent a while googling and have tried a lot of the suggestion there, namely setting it to default, drivers etc. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Any help or advice would be welcomed. If anybody wants pictures of PU usage during gameplay or anything then let me know. A quick aside note, when launching a game, you can navigate to the . exe and right click and select with graphics processes - when I try to launch the game with way, selecting my 1050, I get the error message from steam saying error occurred while updating (app configuration . I can launch the game just by clicking play in steam though. If its of any use, the game is installed on an external SD. One more note, I don't have this problem with any other games, they use my PU (as far as I am aware. I make a point of checking whenever I play anything now) .

And then just spins and spins until I click retro and then the same thing happens. This has been happening for many months. How can I fix this? Thanks!  So I'm an avid gamer, I play shit like Valorant and Apex which means when I'm in-game, I'm always using the wifi connection, and I'm having a problem where my internet straight out isn't detectable by my laptop or my phone, so I know it isn't some sort of hardware/driver issue with just my Px. When it cuts out, I can't connect to it at all. This only lasts anywhere from 8 seconds to almost a minute. Since my internet is off for that long, it hard disconnect me from whatever I'm doing and I have to relaunch the client, including Discord calls and/or whatever I'm doing in my browser or while I'm in a match. Afterwards, though, everything goes back to normal until it does it again. Some days it'll do it more than 5 times, others it won't until the end of my night. It can even happen right away in the morning at 6 am, or 1 pm, it doesn't look like it matters. Someday, though rarely, it doesn't happen at all. I've gone as far as timing how long it takes, and I noticed that it happens almost exactly on the hour mark after the first time, though sometimes it'll skip the second hour and do it the third. This has been happening for over a year now and I haven't found any forums or solutions in all the times I've gotten impatient enough to look for a fix myself, so I've finally decided to make my own forum. All of the wifi connection options on my Px disappear, which is weird considering from my room I can usually still see the option to access one or two of my neighbor's routers when it's connected, same for on my phone. I've done a little digging, and the only thing I can think of is possibly a network overload during those times? But that doesn't even add up considering how it's almost exactly at hour increments. Some days it'll happen at X:39, others X:08, but it's generally within the same minute, maybe a few seconds off into the next minute, but always a different hour. In the past, we've called our SP about it multiple times just for them to shoot off our issues and go promote the idea of upgrading our internet to a higher membership, as if that'd fix it. Basically long story short they don't give a fuck and just want more of our money. We have cable internet, I'm unable to use an ethernet cable due to my room being on another floor from the modem and router. To also mention, this happens on the Px we have downstairs, which is connected via Ethernet cable as well, (no clue if it happens as often,) and I've looked into this being a DHC lease issue, and it does appear that sometimes it is, in fact, the lease expiring on its own. This part I plan on fixing as soon as I can contact the SP We've had wifi with this company for quite some time and everyone's apparently forgotten the password to access our router settings to change the lease expiration time. We've also switched to multiple different routers, but to no avail to fix this issue. Could it be a problem with our modem possibly. ? . Please do give advice on how I can finally fix this issue if you have any ideas as to what's occurring, thank you for your time :). If you need specifics on what I'm using and the company, or anything else, just say so and I'll reply as soon as I can.  I shift+left click on my desktop icons, that are organized vertically by type, but the selection highlights them horizontally. This is a nightmare! . Organizing them by type and shift+clicking the first and the last should be an easy way to move all of the same type files, but instead it selects a mixture of files since selects horizontally and not vertically, forcing me to use the drag selection, which isn't perfect since it leaves out any icons outside of the square, I know it's easy to ctrl+click select the remaining icons, but it's just driving me nuts.

The To was advertised on the store's site that it has a built-in receiver but how would i know they only meant for Antenna, and i only have a coaxial cable that comes straight down from a Satellite on the roof so how do i make this work ? . I have found on the internet that there are some kind of adapters that make the coaxial cable compatible with the Antenna/Cable-in port but i am afraid to try it.  I've mentioned this problem here before but it keeps re appearing when i download some app on play store, i tried restarting my phone and it disappears but it appears again sometimes when i download some apps.  Hello, Im in the process of trying to restore a few laptops, the 15-r011dx being one of them. I booted it and pressed f11 to get into the troubleshoot menu, click reset, and it asks me to choose a target operating system, windows 10 being the only option (it was a windows 8 laptop). It hasn prompted me to choose a target operating system on the other laptops that Im restoring so Im confused. After I select the only option, windows 10, it pulls up a screen that says Insert your windows installation or recovery media to continue. Again Ive never seen that happen when trying to reset a laptop. When I look it up it says that may be an indicator of a faulty hard drive? Is there a way I can bypass this, or is the only option obtaining a windows installation disc?  Was trying to fix a PM 2. 0 issue through IOS to fix my valorant launching issue and I messed with something called Px key where I just pressed enter a couple times stupidly and now my computer turns on but wont connect to my monitor, mouse or keyboard. gigabyte B450M motherboard. I bought this computer today so I really hope this is reversible, any ideas? . EDIT: I should mention there is an orange light coming from the motherboard but Im not sure what it means.  My Dell Latitude E7440 stopped connecting to my GoogleHome Wiki on Sunday after working perfectly fine on Saturday (no update between the two dates) and was working Sunday morning when I was out of the house at my parents. Now whenever I try to connect to my home wifi I get the message internet, . The computer is running Windows10 and has been for almost 2 years without issue. I first thought it was an problem with my computer and attempted to solve it by following the instructions laid out and . The only thing I haven't done is replace the driver. I took my computer to work the following day and found that it still connects to the wifi there, which seemed really strange to me. When I returned home I ran the troubleshooter and get the following message remote device or resource won't accept the I reset my GoogleHome and this didn't fix it either. I've now spoken to both Google and Dell and neither has been able to help. Google has said that its Dell's problem. And Dell says the computer is out of warranty, so just get a new one. Any help you guys can provide would be amazing. I hope I chose the right flair since I'm not sure where the actual issue is. This computer is my only way to access certain secure programs I use for work from home so I'd like to get it working again as soon as I can.  So here's what happened:. I have this hp 245 g8 laptop for less than a year, and it has worked fine until now. Ever since yesterday afternoon, when I boot it up, the screen stays black, but the light next to the turn on/off icon lights up, I hear the fans turning (quite heavily in fact), but I hear no sounds, nor do the lights on the caps lock and mute buttons light up when I click on them. When I do boot it up, the laptop heats a lot faster than usual, so that may be tied to the cause of the issue. It was working fine yesterday morning, but it's now like this. It isn't a display/screen issue as I got it working fine yesterday after letting the battery discharge for a bit, the display seemed to work perfectly, however it's back to the same state. I have tried to hard reset it, but it does nothing. The only difference between now and the past year of using this laptop is that I've installed a Nintendo emulator (Citta) to totally legal play some Pokemon games on Saturday. The emulator does use up a lot of ram at times, so it may be tied to that. Id what to do ray, and I'd ray want to avoid having to open the laptop bc I'm afraid I'll break smith by accident. Thanks for any help in advance.  I need your help! And I apologize in advance but Im not tech savvy and dont understand the ling so I might sound stupid. Basically my internet is awful, I can barely browse the web and watch To. I used fast. com and speed test and we consistently get 46maps down and 26maps upload. Even measured via ethernet we only got 85maps! From my room its gets worse (14maps) and I cant do my school work at all. We pay for 300maps via xfinity cable. Our unloaded latency is usually 14ms and our loaded is usually 400ms, my friend said we might have buffer-float but I ran a test via ethernet on waveform. com and it came back fine. I dont know what to do and where to go from here, do you know what is happening? Some people say they had to alter their router properties or enable something? Others are saying its a faulty comcast cable, and some say theres a problem with my hardware. I dont want to just replace all my hardware and have the problem still be there. We switched providers and upgraded our router about 3 years ago and almost instantly it got worse. I have a feeling it might have something to do with that. Edit: we have a netgear nighthawk A1900 c7000v2 if that helps.  General Specifications:. CPU: 12700K. MOB: Asks z690 plus wifi ddr4. PU: TX 1070. AM: Corsair Vengeance 2x8gb 3200MHz (X. M.

Hey, would someone guess the reasoning behind a problem I am facing with my work laptop. I have a usb-c docking station to connect to my mouse, webcam, keyboard and dual monitors. The problem is, when I connect it via the first thunderbolt port (which is also the charging port), my display keeps connecting and disappearing constantly. However, this is fine when I use the other thunderbolt port. The main problem is a bit different: when I use the work laptop with the usb docking station, sometimes the keyboard, mouse or webcam freezes for a couple of settings (i have to replug the mouse and webcam to fix it, the keyboard recovers by itself after a couple of seconds). When I connect my personal laptop to the same system, nothing freezes.  my pc wont display each time i boot it does not show anything it just a no signal my gpu is working fine. Even i plug a keyboard it does not even light up or work. Pos Help. P. S sorry for my english.  Hey all! . Im currently having an issue with my gaming Px thats causing it to be so slow that I can barely even use the Of. Essentially, when I start up the computer, it seems to run fine for a few seconds, and then suddenly everything will start to lag - so slowly that I can hardly move the mouse. Eventually, the screen will go completely black for around 15 seconds and finally when it comes back on, everything will work fine for another few seconds before this process repeats. Im fairly sure its a PU issue (I have an nvidia TX 2060) as the PU usage is quite high even though I have no programs open and have disabled all startup programs - ranging from 40-100% almost all the time. CPU and Memory usage look normal in task manager. Everything works perfectly in Safe Mode and Ive done a complete windows reset with no luck. This issue is driving me up a wall, so I would really appreciate some help! I apologize if theres not enough information, if I left something out please let me know and Ill respond SAP. Thanks!  Hi all,. I have 2 Reuters, my SP(Virgin Up) Provided main router, which has a built in modem, and runs a 2. 4gh wireless connection for my numerous smart home devices and my secondary router (RA70 Nighthawk) Which I use for all devices that need a decent wireless connection). I have it set up like this to keep the smart home stuff separate and because re setting them all up will be a ITA. The problem I can getting is I can't talk to devices directly over the AN that are connected to the different routers. They are on different subsets 192. 168. 1. S 192. 168. 0. which I think is the issue. I can't ping a device on the 1 subset from one on the 0. I assume I have to enable a setting or forward some ports to get these to talk to each other. Can someone tell me the easiest way to allow these to subsets to talk to each other. Thanks,.

Hi, I've spent the last week trying to fix my Px, but NOTHING I try has helped. I built a new Px a couple weeks back, and got it up and running fine. I used it for a couple days, installing the various drivers and games I wanted it for. Then randomly, whilst I was innocently browsing youtube, the Px powered off - and ever since its ben broken. It seems to be related to Windows in some way. Every time the Px tries to boot windows it crashes (Occasionally it BSD, then shortly afterwards crashing). However the Px is perfectly capable of sitting in IOS for as long as it wants to. What works 100% perfectly:. IOS. Memtest86 from SB. The Px can stay on no problems for hours inside SB or memtest . What always crashes the Px:. Booking windows from SD. Booking windows from SB Installation with SSD plugged in. Booking windows from SB Installation without SSD plugged in. The Px immediately crashes after it starts to load windows, sometimes with BSD (different codes each time) . I have tried so many different things! I've moved power cables around, changed drives. used HDD as well as SSD. Tested AM. Replaced the motherboard. Replaced the Power Supply. Repeated everything many times. Installed different IOS versions. Yet nothing seems to work at all. Any ideas? I'm stuck and close to giving up.  I've restarted and checked that comfort view and vision accessibility aren't affecting this, but it won't change back to colour. I have no idea what to do. It was fine 8 hours ago. How do I get my colour back? . Edit: apparently something called digital wellbeing enabled gray-scale. It showed up in my notifications and I turned it off. I feel dumb for missing that.

I was looking over the box and it says that the cable supports DisplayPort 1. 2 but my 1070 To Displayport(s) are 1. 4. This may be the issue or is it just a bad cable? . Thanks for any help.  So for example, if i open up ms edge and watch a video on youtube, when i click on it, the video has already loaded cause my wifi is fast, UT the loading icon appears on the video for a good 10 seconds and then only it plays even tho In AS ALREADY LOADED THE DAN THING! The same thing happens if i pause the video and then un-pause it. The loading icon appears for 10 seconds and then it plays. It's so damn frustrating. Even if i play a downloaded video on the new media player or the old one or any other video app the video loads only after 10 seconds, and if i pause it and play it it plays only after 10 seconds.

Hey guys, I'm not very tech savvy so I've come here for some answers on what may be a very simple question. There is a wifi modem downstairs, and connected to that is a cable that goes into SL and also connects to the wall.

Battery is probably dead, or that the control board inside the battery pack is giving wrong data to Windows hence why laptop won't charge and displays CRITICAL LOW BATTERY when tried to run on battery. To get over the previously mentioned problem, I disabled the API Battery Controller driver in the Device Manager so that Windows ignores that a battery is present. It's working for about 2 days now and counting. CPU Fan is working. My laptop is an Acre Aspire E15 575G-54E, about 4 years old now. My charger and battery are third party, since the original ones broke. New battery was a year old on February. Context + Problem. When I play FT (Teamfight Tactics from Log), laptop shuts down like it lost electricity after 20-30 minutes. I'm still not trying other games but laptop has shut down for the 4th time now in varying duration. The longest was about an hour and a half (I played 2 and a half games before laptop shut down). On my recent FT run, I installed a CPU Temp monitor and it showed that I'm reaching a peak of 75-80 Celsius. Maximum temp was 100 so I'm guessing the CPU isn't the problem. When I don't play, laptop runs fine and doesn't shut down. I was able to run the laptop without the battery using my original charger. Now I can't boot the laptop without the battery plugged-in. Possible Solutions (Will edit the post for results). I tried setting the maximum possible performance of the CPU in the power settings from 100% to 98% in the hopes of reducing the heat of the CPU. Doesn't solve it. I used the CPU Stress Test by Intel Diagnostic Tools, CPU passed. I have a lot of SB ports used (SB Microphone, an external keyboard, mouse and a type-C SB hub where my drawing tablet and laptop cooler is plugged in). I'm currently trying to only plug in my microphone, keyboard, and mouse. I tried setting FT's graphic setting to low. Didn't work. I could buy another battery to solve all of this easily, but I want that to be my last resort. I'll be getting a new Px soon and that's where I plan to buy a new battery so that my dad can use this laptop. For now, I just need this thing to work without needing to buy a new one, since I need it for my classes. I can provide more details if you guys want. I would really like to know your opinion and diagnosis on this matter. Update 1: I finished a game of FT without it shutting down. I wanted to cool the laptop down since I don't want to risk it so I made it idle for a few minutes. Surprisingly, it still booted off at idle. The heck?  I hope I can make this as descriptive as possible. I bought a 256 Gt SanDisk microSDXC card for my Switch on Amazon there's a lot of cool old/upcoming games I wanna prepare to play this year. I'm trying to transfer my data to it from the old one, but I keep running into issues I don't know how to solve. First, I formatted the card to exFAT (if that's important). I had Gt to transfer from my old 128 Gt card but the kb/s would always go to 0 mb/s a few seconds into the process. It would show that it'll take more than 1 day to finish it all, sometimes going down to a few hours, then jumping back up. No progress really gets made each time I try. I started to think that was too much to transfer all at once when someone on Twitter was surprised by the amount after I complained about it taking forever. Then I archived a lot of my games and deleted all of the photos and videos in my album, which brought it down to Gt. I've had much better luck (it got to 20% once) but it still messes up. The kb/s jumps up a little bit sometimes and a percent would get added every so often. The file that it displays it's currently working on doesn't change though, and the number of files left to go through is static while the progress bar moves (kinda). I can't stay around and babysit my laptop for days on end because of work so I have to pause the process a lot (which is how I made any progress at all over two days). While I'm transferring data I also get an error code that says, The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer Then there are options to retro and skip for the current file but I'm not sure what to press. There's also a box that says something like this for all current that I'm not sure I should check or not. I usually delete the files I've downloaded and format the card each time I want to start over, so I'm not sure how useful the skip button is. I've tried each one while also checking the box but no combination has changed much. I've read that formatting a card to NTS would be better depending on the allocation size you use, but I guess mine doesn't allow that regardless because I get a message saying that windows can't complete it. Also, I don't think that works on the Switch? I forgot where I read that, if I even remembered correctly. Anyway, I don't know what specs are specifically needed but this is as much as I can give:.

It doesn't appear in device manager or my taskbar and the bluetooth troubleshooter just tells me my computer isn't compatible with bluetooth when I've used it before. Could anyone help me fix this issue?  For the past 2 weeks my Px would randomly and occasionally reboot. Just quietly turn off and start again after about 2 seconds. I've only had the browser open and nothing intensive, so I guess it can't be anything heat related (though unfortunately I never checked). I checked the Windows Event Log and it only said something about and nothing specific. Today it turned off again, but since then it won't start anymore. I did a memtest a couple days ago which came out ok. Wanted to check the SU but my multimeter died not to long ago and I just ordered a new one. So currently I'm hoping it's the SU because that can be easily replaced. If it's CPU or mainboard I have a problem, because I'd have to replace 2-3 components and I was actually waiting for the new MD CPUs at the end of the year and DR5 because my Px is (or rather was) running perfectly fine. One more thing: When the SU is on, the ED on the AN interface on the mainboard is orange, so there seems to be electricity at least. I guess there's not much you can help me with since I have so little Info, but I'm hoping someone here might have experience or suggestions with this. Edit, just for clarification: won't boot doesn't react at all when pressing the power button. Not even a twiching of the fans. Update: I just found something very strange. When I push the 24pin cable close to the connector on the mainboard to the right, the Px turns on (without pressing the power button). When I push it back to the left it turns off. I'm now suspecting either a loose connection on that cable, or between cable and socket, or maybe even the mainboard touching the case maybe? (however the last option is strange, because it just suddenly started happening).  My Ethernet connection on my home pc seems to have become very spike over last couple days with it constantly dropping down to 0 and then jumping all the back up and then dropping again and I have no clue why. I have reset the modem, rolledback drivers, updated computer and restarted my computer. It also now with this struggles to connect to websites and games. Any help would be appreciated.  So I was scrolling through google and accidentally clicked on a link that was sketchy and immediately closed the tab.

Hello guys, I just built my computer a hour ago and I decided to just turn it on. Unfortunately, my Px doesn't start. My motherboard is a : SI B550 TOMAHAWK. My CPU : Afd Ryzen 5 5600X.

I recently built a gaming Px to replace my daily driver laptop. I don't plan to sell it anytime soon, since I'll be needing it for in-person classes, but with COVID in my country, that still seems like a long way off. What can I do to maintain its performance, as well as battery level? Thanks!  ASA is a protocol that allows Android phones to connect to hearing aids in the same way that it connects to other Bluetooth audio devices such as headphones, allowing the streaming of music, phone calls, notifications, etc. I want to buy this phone but I'm not sure if it will be compatible with my hearing aids or not.

Thank you for your help.  Hello to everyone. I used clonezilla to make the img file of my name disk,where I have installed Windows 11 and Ubuntu. You can see the partition scheme below :. First of all I've cloned all the partitions except the Linux ones. On the next step I wanted to clone all the Linux partitions except the Windows ones. Now,what I want to do is to create two separated / bootable img files,the first one should contain only the partitions needed to boot and run Windows and the second one only the partitions needed to boot and run Ubuntu. Each img file should not be larger than 450 Gt because I need to store each one of those files inside a 465 Gt size ssd disk. What happens with Clonezilla is that it didn't create a single img file,but a lot of spare files,with different extensions (. list . txt . disk . aa and so on) and I don't know what to do with all of these. Is there some mistake somewhere ? I would manually using partclone for each partition,examining log files of successful imaging with clonezilla and check out how did it take boot sectors and partition table and incorporate that in my workflow. But I have no idea about how to do all that. Can u provide a tutorial ? Or,using an easier approach ? Can u suggest tome tool that can help me to automate the whole procedure ? The Bhyve hypervisor accepts only img files. So,whatever tool or method I will chose,it should produce an img file.  So I have an W My Passport Ultra 1To external hard drive with family photos and videos that I need to save. The drive is several years old. Im trying to transfer them from one external hard drive to another. The W is having some trouble and malfunction and Im trying to save the data on it. Ive tried using Chkdsk on a windows pc but it gives some read failures and tells me Windows cant fix it. When I plug it into my MacBook Pro early 2011 I can access the data when I open one folder at the time and let it load up for a long time and when its all loaded up I transfer the data to another external hard drive. The problem is that it takes a huge amount of time. For example, a video of 592B has been transferring for 8 hours now and is for 505B complete. I tried using another cable and also other SB ports on the mac but it doesnt make any difference. Is there a trick or fix to speed up the process or will I have to be waiting for days until Ill be done transferring the data? . The W of 1To has a capacity of 931Gt and only 100Gt is used. So its not full. This is my second time posting something on Reddit so I have no idea if Im doing this right. I know some things about pcs and MacBook but Im not an expert at all. Maybe theres someone who knows what to do. Thanks.  Hey all. I have a relatively new build (within the last 6 months) that was working perfectly until last night. I booted it up as usual and was using it normally, when suddenly it blue screened. Since then it has been caught in a BSD loop whenever I power it on. Essentially, after powering on it displays the motherboard splash screen and then immediately goes into the BSD with the stop code AD_OBJECT_HEADER. It then restart and displays automatic under the B logo, but goes straight into the blue screen again. It does this loop endlessly. I have made a windows install SB and attempted to repair it through that, but after selecting windows 64 it says it is loading the files before blue screening again. I'm not very knowledgeable about hardware so I'm a little scared to go fiddling with the insides. Any advice? . SI B550-A pro. MD Ryzen 5600x. Crucial P5 1000GB. 2 SD.

Hi all, I've had this Px for nearly 2 years, after booking it again it's just suddenly stopped displaying anything with no SB power. I've seen this problem before but I've done everything on the list, I've changed AM slots, only used one, checked all the SU connections, removed all PCI cards, checked the SU fan was working, the whole shebang. absolutely dying over here because I really need it for schoolwork (and I havent played any games in a couple days and I'm starting to show withdrawal symptoms).

I have been seeing for the past few days now that my windows event log is full of critical errors. The ones I see most often are the following: EVENT In 41, EVENT In 6008, EVENT In 29.

Hi, since friday I can't access any functions related to windows search. Start menu search doesn't open, in file explorer when you try to type something you get freeze and bar becomes grey. What is also strange, when I open settings app it crashes after few seconds. I've tried different tutorials, restarting winsearch in task manager etc. but I can't even run Powershell as administrator as start menu crashes when I right click Powershell icon. Does anyone have any idea, how can I fix those issues?  Ok, maybe this is really stupid but I'm not an expert in this. A friend of mine got his phone near mine, and then he showed me a photo of me and my mom on his phone. He told me that he used FC technology and that he got a random photo from my phone. He said it was a joke and then he deleted the photo. I really don't understand if this is really a joke or not. Now, there a two possibilities:. 1. He got the photo from my Facebook/Instagram. The photo is really old though, like from 2/3 years ago. 2. He really used this FC technology. Is it really possible to just transfer photos without my phone asking for consent? Could it be possible that he took all of my photos or anything else? Thanks for the help.  Can anyone help me, I have no idea why it's doing this still. It keep scrolling down on its own. I even turned off the scrolling thing in the setting. Anyone have advice? It won't do that while I'm internet browsing. Scratch that. It has begun doing that to certain websites.  I am currently working remotely, connecting to a remote windows computer in the office, which is then connected to some hardware that I am developing/testing. I use remote desktop connection (DC) for connecting to the computer. The thing is the office is far away, and if I accidentally turn off the Px or that it restart and then connects to the wrong wifi point no ethernet cable available), I can't connect to the computer anymore. The easiest would be to ask for colleagues for help obviously, but most of the time there's no one in the office since it is so far away. Anyone have faced this issue? I have an idea to use a simple robot arm that is placed on top of the start button of the computer, and can press it to restart the computer if I accidentally turn it off. Also to place a cheap surveillance camera in front of the computer. But it's pretty costly and may not work. Anyone have any smart ideas to remotely physically interact with the computer?  So I've been having major performance issues with my 2080 VENTUS 8G. I was getting about 20PS on medium settings on just about everything. Support told me to wipe all the drivers and install new ones, but with GeForce Experience, which I have avoided. New drivers installed, still no good. Then I launch GeForce Experience, and bam, my frames triple. I don't know why it's so reliant on that little piece of software, but whatever. The new problem is that now games in widowed or borderless widowed develop this odd shutter problem when it's in the foreground. If you hit the Windows key or open a different program, it immediately goes back to butter. It's not a frame rate drop in at least, the in game PS counter doesn't think so. Switching to fullscreen mode fixes it, but why? I'm fine just using fullscreen the rest of my life, but it makes no damn sense why my performance would drop to slideshow levels. It's gotta have something to do with GeForce Experience because it didn't happen before I installed it.  My in my opinion alright pc went incredibly slow, failing to do almost anything.

I have an strange issue with my laptop. It's Lenovo IdeaPad 700 15-SK. Has an Realtek brand audio drive. Problem is, when i plug in my headphones, there is sound on headphones, when i unplug there is sound on laptop, when i plug in my headphones Ns sound after that on headphones. If i unplug sound comes from laptop but how many times i tried to plug in my headphones no sound. I have to restart the computer to get sound from headphones. I tried the troubleshoots on Windows, I tried to uninstall and install the driver, I tried to update the computer, i Changed my headphones. None of them work. I don't know what to do. I hope you guys will help me. Thanks.  So I just got a decent deal on one of the Omen desktop, and know that its coming with 1 To of NME space. I know that theres two ATA ports, so I can just bring my SD and DD from my other computer right? Neither have the Of on them, and would be coming with data already loaded on them like games. Personal files Im just going to put on SB sticks to transfer over. The two drives are compatible with the computer Im sure, Im just worried since they already have data and are already formatted. Will I be fine just plugging these in? Ill also be adding more ram to the computer, not same brand but everything else is the same. Should everything be fine to just move over?  Hi! I've had i5 750 and Gt 1030 as my Px and it worked like a charm on my 43 inch To on 4k 60 hz refresh rate. Recently I've upgraded(sort-a) my setup with Ryzen 2600x and R9 380x. Now, my issue is that the To won't work in 4k with 60hz refresh rate, I can only use 60hz in a 1920x1080 resolution, when I put 4k resolution, it automatically locks my screen at 24hz. Is there any solution to this, or I have to live with using Full He instead of 4k?  Hello recently i bought a ssd and a Candy for my old had in a asks x555lj the problem is that the had that is in the Candy , is increasing the unsafe shutdown count everytime i restart the laptop, the Candy is Oricon Lt Series V1 Pro, I moved the switch on the Candy but without any luck. Can somebody help me? The had in Candy is seen as a had in bios.  I need to share file locations with co-workers but every time I copy a location, it copies my drive name which obviously is not accessible to anyone else. How to fix?  I've recently assembled a gaming pc and wanted to hook up a headset to it. The headset I purchased came with a cable splitter that has a pink cable for mic and a green cable for the headphones. I connected these cables to their respective coloured audio ports on my pc, but the mic doesnt appear to work. I enabled mic access for all apps and tried a few of the other inputs, but none appear to work. Is this problem caused by a driver I havent installed yet, or is it maybe a hardware problem?  Installed a program and it isn't opening at all. I feel like I've done everything i can. reinstalled, tried older versions, turned off my anti virus and firewall, restarted my pc several times, checked for any malware, done all sorts of command prompt shit, given it admin permissions and yet it still doesn't open. Anytime I try run the program it does absolutely nothing and the . bat files/ command prompts that come with the program close immediately after opening, on top of this all- I can't see any crash logs. The program doesn't even make it's own roaming file- it doesn't do anything at all. Any help? I'm so stuck.  Hi, so just as the title says for the last few months every time I try to launch or tab out of a very intensive game my pc display turns off and the fans get super fast but the pc takes a few seconds to actually turn off cause I can still hear the game going a little bit after. However I don't know if this is actually hardware related cause I've run every stress test and benchmark in the book and my parts do amazingly and nothing crashes. I understand this stuff is similar to a driver crash but I don't know what I could be doing wrong. I have used DD in safe mode and unplugged my ethernet cable to reinstall the latest NVIDIA drivers at least 10 times now and I still get the same issue, I've even factory reset my pc a few times but nothing is working. Any help or advice is appreciated, I haven't been able to game on my pc properly for months and so far the only thing that seems to delay these crashes is lowering my PU power limit to 42% in SI afterburners.  Hey,. Over the past few months I've noticed my self-built gaming Px crashes at certain points while playing the Pitcher 3 been playing this the most over this period and have tonnes of hours in it with this build, so i don't think it's an issue with the game itself). The crash usually gives a black screen with game music still playing, with the monitor not registering any video output, so I have to hard reset, which usually fixes it. Today, same thing happened, but hard resetting did nothing, even after multiple rests, the computer turned on but gave no video output. I did some research online and saw people suggesting taking out individual AM sticks for this sort of issue. I took one out and it worked, which made me think it was a faulty stick! But on booking up Pitcher, the game was laggy as hell, to the point of not getting past the first loading screen. No worries, I thought, it's just because I'm playing with half the AM. I load the one back in, and same result. On checking Task Manager, CPU usage on the Pitcher main menu is around 100%, whereas memory is only about 50%. I try with only the other stick in, same problem. I also tried another game on a different drive, same problem, so it's not an issue with the drive. This makes me think that somehow the CPU is stuffed, but I'm not entirely sure why the computer turned back on when I took that AM stick out. Maybe a coincidence? Or would a faulty AM stick make my CPU max out its processing power with simple tasks? I also started noticing this issue when I got myself a new monitor and started using Display Port instead of DMI, but god knows how a peripheral would have this effect. At this point I can tell something isn't working but I want to be sure what I need to replace first. Also, all of my components, save my DD (with the Pitcher 3 on it) and one of my SSD (with the Of on it) are no more than 2 years old. Thank you so much in advance for any help! . Build:.

I've noticed that my laptop becomes incredibly hot even when I'm just browsing the internet (+70C). I went to the task manager and saw that Java (To) Platform S binary is using around 20-25% CPU. I think this started when I updated java. Any tips on how to fix this? Should I just end the task? I'm afraid this will mess up with my other programs. My computer has 4Gt AM.  Hey everyone. I noticed sometimes while gaming in the last few days that when I close all my tabs, there is a random PayPal window open, stuck some sort of loading screen (not a payment processing or login loading screen). This has happened a few times, and it has happened while Im gaming rather than immediately when the computer opens up. I think it is either some weird residual steam transaction or someone trying to access my PayPal . I havent downloaded anything on my main Px in a long time, but did accidentally both download and run a weird looking file on a laptop running on the same Wiki, although nothing happened on that computer. Already reinstalled Of on that device too. Any ideas? I havent seen anything weird running in task manager and windows scans havent turned up anything.  I recently got a new pair of Tumi Pure Sound Headphones with a built in microphone, the headphones are great yet when I connect them to my Xbox or Oculus the microphone doesn't work, please help!  So my Px encountered BSD for the 1st time today and i was panicking and didn't see the stop code on the screen. so after my Px Successfully booted, i searched my Px logs via reliability monitor and this description showed up. The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x00000124 (0x0000000000000001, 0xffffc60d34d31208, 0x000000009c203000, 0x000000000001085b). A dump was saved in: Report Id: cd2ec177-9b0b-4089-b0ed-50f3c84d601a. Anyone know the meaning of this so that i hopefully can know the reason for the BSD. Operating System: Windows 10 pro 64-bit (10. 0, build 19044).  Hi all, over the weekend I built my friend a new pc so he could play elder ring. The specs are as follows: . SI Z390 PG GAMING PLUS. I9 9900K. CORSAIR M650X. 2X 8Gt CORSAIR VENGEANCE LP DR4-3600 L18. SAMSUNG 970 VO PLUS 1To M. 2 2280. NOCTUA Ns-D15 COOLER. SI 1060 ARMOR OC (from old system). W GREEN 2To (from old system). Unfortunately when installing windows 10 pro 64 bit onto the system it froze on 86% the first time but completed the second time, then the pc began freezing at random moments with the only option being to hold the power button to shut down and power back up. At this point we decided to do a clean install of windows 10 again but couldn't get it passed the 50% mark so we had to use his old system to install the Of onto his 2To hard drive (which we had formatted) as the old system had no m. 2 slots. The CPU stays cool at 30 degrees so no issue there, we have tried booking with and without the graphics card and still the same issue, we have tried 1 stick of AM and used both singularly to no avail, we have clashed the bios with the latest software. The only time we can get it stable is in safe mode which is where we installed the graphics drivers and audio drivers. It is perfectly fine in safe mode which leads me to believe software is the issue but it is a clean install of windows 10 and freezing in the installer? I'm all out of talent and need your help! . My friend is going to try swap the power supplies today to see if that helps, I have also advised booking into safe mode and doing a clean boot with as little startup apps as possible. We have also tried setting the AM to 3000 MHz, turning amp off and using a different usb with windows loaded onto it.  When I boot or wake from sleep, it repeats cant connect to this network or no internet for solid 5-10 minutes. I have to keep trying until it finally stays connected. Any idea what could be the problem? It works fine afterwards, but the initial connection keeps failing until it simply doesnt.  My laptop got broken. Tech support said my bios or video card is dead. My only storage is DD. Though my school files are in my desktop. If i remove my DD and put it in an enclosure can i still get my school files? what are the files i can still recover if i enclose my DD?  This is about a rebuilt (OptiPlex 9020 T) with an i7-4790, 8gb stock ram, completely stock (to my knowledge) no PU in it yet. Yesterday, when I turned it on, it said something along the lines of something something thermal and gave me some options to do a bunch of testing and it took forever, sorry I don't have the exact words. This was worrying, I did like the maximum amount of tests and it found no issues. (You do not have to read this part if it's to long but could be helpful and might be related) This may have been caused by some family member picking up my pc and tumbling with it, may have unplugged the Px slightly when doing that, or something else. Not sure, Px may have been on (wasnt using it, was doing some work at my desk, think it was in sleep mode do it inactivity or maybe fully shut down). Anyway, the next time I turned it on, that's what displayed. The weird sound on boot up has been happening since I got it recently. It isn't to bad, but sounds kind of grind, and then ticks 2-3 times (I only have an ssd, ATA is that matters. ). (This part isn't crucial although would give a better picture, as to why I do not want to return it). I can still return it, but comparable Pos are like more, plus ish return shipping, and then having to pay for a new keyboard (I like the included keyboard, think it's about lower end older keyboard but not like so that would cost me a significant amount to return and I really do not want to. Think the thermal thing is might be fine, if that didn't pop up and I was DEA I would have no reason to be concerned about this computer. It doesn't really affect anything. I'm also not sure about the tempatures, never checked since I have only been web browsing and playing roblox, plus my fan seems like it always runs at minimum PM, although I have a dehumidifier on so I don't even hear it. I think I'm going to install some temp checkers tomorrow though. Sorry if that was way to long. I just wanna get the full picture. ITA! . Thank you to anyone who helps. The fans also look perfectly functional and not put in incorrectly or anything, but this is my first Px. Is this weird sound normal? Doesn't seem like it. To be clear the Px is perfectly usable and I've definitely never had a thermal shutdown during usage.  In short, I've reset my phone, and before, when I try to open a drive file in a browser and it in drive prompts me to open with a file manager, now it's both gone and sends me directly to drive, it only now works when I post it to Chrome, any solutions?  Hi. So my laptop fans suddenly starts this loud whirring even though cpu and gpu temps are under 50-60 C . I took a video and the faulty fan seems to move weirdly. It starts off smooth like the working one and suddenly starts making the loud noise. The laptop is a Rog Strip G . I already cleaned the fans and the vent and removed all dust from there.  hello, . so basically my sister has this hp pavilion laptop and when she booted it up today, it showed this message: the system bios pending image is being cleared randomly and now it shows this: enter password key for this drive. its on windows 10. i have no idea what that means, so how can i get rid of that? thanks for any help! :).  like, this been happening for about a month or so and let's say, this happens only when I download something in steam, in any other platforms I don't have any problems, but in steam it's just this way. constantly the download peaks at 4 B/S which is weird at first, then it goes down to 0 B/S, then it may go up to something between 2 B/S and 450 or so KB/S. My download time on any other platform is fast I would say, something of like 10 Gt would download in 1 hour, and when I try to download something like that in steam it says it will take that long, but then the thing above happens. I've tried to clean the cache, I changed the server, I even re installed steam maybe twice but it doesn't work, what else can I do?  Hello, i deleted some bookmarks from tor browser i actually still need. I did not clean or restart the computer. I'm on macOS 11. 2. 1 . would really appreciate if somebody knew how to recover them.  I recently replaced the screen on my laptop (a Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5) because of some broken plastic internally, and since doing that the angle sensor seems to be incorrect - when the screen is mostly closed, the keyboard and trackpad remain on. However, when pushing the screen back to a comfortable level they disable, as if the screen was pushed far enough back to enable tablet mode. Confusingly, what it's doing enabling unbuilt tablet mode, but rather it's just disabling the trackpad and keyboard. Tablet mode can still be enabled/disabled separately from this and has no effect on the trackpad or keyboard. I'm looking for a way to do one of several things:. Recalibrate the angle sensor. Move the angle sensor. Disable the software or process that switches me into tablet mode. I'm running a standard Windows 10 on this laptop. Thanks :). Edit: Looked through my drivers and found UDF and Google says that's used for angle sensing (and that people have had similar issues with other laptops) - I guess that's what I'm looking to recalibrate. I also have device orientation if I show hidden devices.  Hello,. I just finished building my custom loop Px (5800x, B550I Strip, 6800xt, S750 SU, Meshlicious Case) and my Px strangely can't OST until I reconnect the DisplayPort Cable immediately after pressing the Power Button. If I don't do anything, the LEDs on my motherboard will cycle from RAM, CPU, GA, then back to RAM, etc. But once I reinsert and OST, I get a message saying I POSTED into safe mode and I have to enter the IOS. Once I exit, the system reboot and I have to continue disconnecting/reconnecting the DisplayPort until the I reach Windows. Does anybody know what's going on and how to fix it?  I bought a pc for gaming and well I chose to reset my pc to factory settings and its been on the 99% for 2 days now I dont know what I should do, everyone is saying to leave it but Im scared its not going to go anywhere what should I do?  so i was wandering whether i can install security patches manually after discontinuation of my phone or do i have to upgrade to something like lineage os.  I'm running it on windows 10, if that helps. How do I prevent it from connecting to the internet? I know Not much of a tech support question, but. How do I practice my best safety when using this?  Ive been playing Valorant on my laptop, and the fps is pretty underwhelming. Im seeing people with X580s getting a consistent 200 fps. Here are my specs.

Is 8gb of ram really holding me back that badly? . My PS monitor says Im using 4. 5 gb of Ram, and 1. 3gb is available, but it always stays at that and doesnt change while under load. Also doesnt add up to 8gb . -My gpu temp is 62c and at 40% load. -My cpu temp is 71c and at 30-50% load. Please help, my drivers are all up to date, havent done any over blocking and I make sure Valorant is my only open program in task manager. Is it unrealistic to be expecting 180+ PS with my setup? Will another stick of ram get me there, and also, can I just add another with the same mhz speed, or will I need two new sticks of the same brand? .  I've got a good one. My monitor only boots some of the time specifically when windows does a it works fine but when it does a fast boot it won't turn on the monitor. I did a full wipe and reload 4 months ago and it fixed it until 4 days ago. Did another wipe/reload and this time it didn't fix the issue. Also have checked the AM and hard drives. Updated every driver I can find and the IOS. Any thoughts would be most helpful.  I went to microcenter and got parts for 2 computers. When we try and install windows on either it fails to show up on the list of drives available. Px1. i7 - 12700k . Asks Prime z690p wifi . In bios the drive does show up in storage information.

If I use 4G on my phone, I can access these websites just fine - it's only when I connect to my wifi it plays up. The error shows up saying having trouble finding that (Firefox). I know my internet is working because I can access any website without Youtube, facebook and every other websites that don't use works. I am currently using an AUS A1800 router for 2 months and this is the first time this happened. It was working yesterday and this morning and all of a sudden, it just doesn't want to work. I haven't played around the settings so not sure what caused this. This is causing a problem for me as i need to pay bills online and of course, they're an Australian website. I don't use PN in case anyone is wondering. Help please. Edit: I used a different router and same problem. Edit: it's working now. Not sure what happened but it's back to normal. If anyone knows why, please comment so I know what the hell happened.  So I've been trying to sort this out for the last couple of hours (changed NS, restarted router, just waited, etc) but I can't work this out. Most sites are loading fine - for example, I'm on reddit right now - but some In particular, I'm trying to access academic sites such as google scholar as well as sites and databases belonging to my university. Haven't had this issue before and the bill to my SP isn't due for a couple of weeks too. Any thoughts on what the issue could be? The sites won't load on my phone either. I use a Mac and have tried both chrome and safari, unfortunately I don't have access to another Of.  I just bought a second name, since I ran out of storage on my first one. My first thought was to move random files like from the first name to the second. However, I was advised not to do that. I just wanted to know what are my options for freeing up space on my first name and putting a few things on the second one?  I don't know about you guys but this has been bothering me awhile now. I have a vivo y76 5g phone and everytime I open an app, for example a game like col and cod, the status bar like the Wiki, battery percent, sim, etc and except for the time, they all disappear when I am in homescreen. I can only it when I swine down to look at the notifications. I want it to always be displayed, but I don't know what is causing it this way. When I change my display size, it goes back to normal. But when I try to open a game and exit out, it goes back to its problem. Only the tim3 is visible. It would be appreciated if you guys can help me. I also provided a screenshot of my problem.  I got samsung ssd 970 evo plus 2tb, and the label definitely reads as 2tb. However my computer reads it as 1tb only. Is there any way to change this? . I tried changing it to gt? Doesn't work. Does this laptop not recognize 2tb?  I changed the thumbnail of a M4 video on Window 10 and it worked, but not in my Samsung phone with Android 11 and 10. I only need the frame of the video. In Window i used Icarus v. 3. 2. 1. Can anyone help?  My specs are. -Ryzen 7 2700. -Gt 1050ti. -16 Gb Dr4 3200mhz Skill ripjaws V. - B450 Tomahawk max. My system was working fine until i tested my sisters ryzen 3200g on my system. After putting the 3200g in my system it didnt boot anymore, i put all of my original components on the mob back and it didnt boot anymore, tested all of other components to other pcs and it all works, no beats on my cpu my gpu works fine, ram works my case isntngrounding the motherboard, tried to reflash the bios but that didnt work too, tried to hard reset bios but to no avail either, tested it with another psu outside the case didnt work either and there is no physical damage. The only thing i didnt try is to flash it with an older bios.  it keeps telling me that my acc does not have perm even though i put the acc into the admin group and i also ran it as admin, i also tried editing it in regedit but when i try it said edit start: error writing the values new Are all onion links bad.  Hopefully that makes sense. I am not totally sure how encrypted files work, but I thought maybe because it was basically a locked file, that maybe the AID controller did not detect that it was corrupted, and so the mirrored drive could have the non-corrupted file on it. I just don't want to bother taking it apart and taking my case apart and looking my drive up if there is no chance that the mirrored file is intact and potentially not corrupted so I can access.  Sometimes my pc goes months without this happening but lately its been BSD/freezing a lot doing different things, or something nothing.

Specs . gigabyte b450 torus pro wi-fi motherboard . 8gb ram 3200 corsair / amd 3600x cpu / 6800xt amd gpu / 850w Seasonid FOCUS Gold+ SU. After 5 months of no issues. Px Frozen, hard restart, no OST. Checked AM, CPU, PU, SU individually, all those components are working fine. Changed to same motherboard brand/model, after 1 month, same issue again! . Are gigabyte motherboard that bad?  Hello, I come here as I've done a lot of searching around and trying to fix this issue to no avail. Basically I have a 2To Seagate DD that plugs in via SB, it's barely a year old so my suspicions of a hardware failure are slim. So, when playing games from it I started getting some slowdown and I've written/deleted a lot of files in it (almost filling it up once), so I decided to check if it was fragmented a couple of days ago and it showed to be 30% fragmented by the Windows tool, so I started defragmenting it but never really let it finish (I properly canceled it each time) because sometimes I had to switch Of or just shut down the laptop. So little by little the fragmentation kept getting lower. Today in the morning when I plugged the drive it didn't show up in file explorer to my surprise, (the drive does receive power) I checked on disk management and nothing there, after removing it, plugging it etc. Nothing happened. I checked device manager but there was only the old register of the device, when I uninstalled the driver it never reinstalled after reboot. I have ran diskpart and list disk and only my internal SD shows up, I also tried plugging it on the other port, on an SB hub too but nothing, I plugged a SB drive and it worked so its not a port issue. Also Linux lsblk shows nothing, at least I didn't recognize the drive, only partitions of the main one. After a few restart I settled down on Windows and after having the drive plugged in for a while it was recognized, with its files intact, from there it worked. So I figured it probably was screwed from the defragmenting process, so I rerun it so that it could finish properly, I started playing in the same drive because I had nothing to do and all was good, until I heard the Windows 11 device removed sound, and then the plugged sound immediately, of course the defragmenting was canceled, and the game closed down, and from then I'm back to square one. It doesn't show up again even after waiting for a while and restarting multiple times. Some additional info, I also ran Seatools and the disk doesnt show up, only a weird MST XVDD thats supposed to be an Xbox thing (Its always there whether the DD is plugged or not) EaseUS and Testdisk show nothing too. I'll gladly appreciate any help, thanks for reading. EDIT: Important detail, the Optimize drives tool from Windows shows this under additional drives: as a hard disk drive. Its very likely to be that, but why does it only show up here?  Just like the post says. With 120hz Ts becoming more common and only having DMI why cant someone make a good DisplayPort to DMI 2. 1 adapter. I have a 2080 ti but cant output 4k120 to my To because I have yet to run across a good Display Port to DMI 2. 1 converter. Anyone have any good ideas?  Ok so, I got a new mouse today off of amazon, I adjusted the sensitivity in windows settings and am on a good dpi setting tell you what it is) and its a great sensitivity for me on desktop. However whenever I go into any game whether it be Valorant, Apex, Col, and even Roblox. The sensitivity just feels like it skyrockets and even when lowering in game sensitivity to the lowest it is still so sensitive that its hard to control. Any ways to fix this?  Okay, so I have a collection of old floppy disks and it's sort of a hobby of mine. So, naturally I bought a SB floppy drive from Sabrent to replace my Ization drive from the early It works great, and performs better than the drive I replaced. However, it keeps checking my drive for a disk every 3 seconds or so when it's plugged in. It is annoying as hell to have to hear that clicking and buzzing when I am not even using the thing. I don't want to have to disconnect it when not in use but I cannot figure out how to make it stop checking for a disk. I'm using Manjaro Linux if that matters. Edit: Sorry for the typo, just noticed that.  I need some help over here, Basically I did not use my computer for 3 days in a row, today when I turned it on the screens did not show anything and it remained like that for almost half an hour, I confirmed that the cables and monitors were properly connected and I even tried a different monitor and still without get a response, so I decided to turn off the computer and try to turn it on again and continued without results, several attempts later I managed to start windows and everything went correctly until it froze, I restarted again and did a windows problem analysis and it said that everything was correct, I opened the task manager and there was no program that I did not recognize, when trying to open programs it was extremely slow so I decided to turn it off this time a warning appeared that an application was preventing it from turning off, this application did not have a name or icon , i tuned it off anyway and turned it back on, it's extremely slow, the last time I used it it ran perfectly and I did not have any problem, the antivirus scans come out totally clean, I do not know what is happening, I would appreciate any answer. Thank you.  Troubleshooting Help:. Parts List. Motherboard: SI B450 Gaming Plus CPU: I7-7700k PU: x 1060 gb 1To SD (W) AM: 2 x 8 gb Corsair Vengeance 2600 mhz. Problem:. Had to go on an airplane with my computer so I removed my PU, AM and wifi card from my computer. Yesterday I put it all back together and my computer would not OST. The machine turned on and all the fans were spinning, my keyboard GB lit up however nothing would display on the screen and I did not hear any motherboard keeps. The Z Debut light shows a solid redlight under CPU. I packed all of my clothes around my Px to prevent damage. There is no exterior or any noticeable damage at all so I don't think anything broke from any sort of impact. List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem. I've tried every AM IMM slot, used one AM, tried a different AM. Took the MOS out for 3 mins and put it back in. I removed the PU, SD and all extra cards wires that are not essential. Even removing all the AM, the same outcome happens. The only time I had a different outcome was when I put the AM in the incorrect IMM slots causing my Px to shut off after . 5 seconds. also tried both gpu, mob graphics. tried re-seating cpu. and new cms battery.  Hello, I've purchased a 4tb 3. 0 external DD from a thrift store today. I've completely formatted it and assigned a drive letter. I ran Crystal disk mark scan and here are the results .

I bought an ethernet cable today and plugged it in, but it says 2. 4g and not the 5g? . Id if it makes a difference since its not wifi.  hello and thanks in advance for answering. I have a gaming laptop, SI Gt65 Thin and the original charger broke a few days ago and I'm currently buying a new one that slightly has a different power output. Original :20V-9A-180W.

Google podcasts implemented some annoying age verification thing, so I verified my age. I am over 18/21. Google acknowledges my verified age. And yet, podcasts that were in my feed yesterday are still no longer available today. Does anyone know how I can fix this?  After looking into why my 3070 was struggling to render graphics at recommended settings i found out via the IOS that its PCI connection is at x1 in slot 1. Moving to slot 2, which is not recommended by the manufacturer, yields x8. I have cleaned both slots and the 3070 but the connections at each port remains the same. Any ideas on what more i can do besides replace the B? . Specs: . CPU: i7 9700k . B: AUS Z390-A . PU: TX 3070 E . AM: 2x8Gt 3200MHz . SU: 750W.  Running W11. TX 2080s slowly using more and more memory. The highest I've seen it go is 25% usage at idle. After a fresh restart, it starts at 6% usage, then slowly climbs over a few days until it seems to cap at 25%. It's very annoying because it causes some games to crash (shadow of the tomb raider is one) when the game runs out of memory to use. I am hoping it's just a software issue and not a hardware issue like a memory leak. Wondering if anyone else is having/had a similar issue or if there's a way to fix it.  So like, I copy and pasted the longest word in the English language (Titan Protein name) in a group chat I'm in. I didn't even send it, just pasted it and all of the sudden, everything crashed. I was opening/closing it over and over, nothing loaded, just a black screen. I waited for about 15 minutes for it to fix, but it still didn't work. So I restarted my phone to see if that would fix it, but it My phone is getting really hot right now too. Other apps seem to work just fine, just not the messages app. Appreciate the help.

My girlfriend recently got an iPad mini from her brother that had been sitting around for years without use and dead. She started charging the iPad and it wont turn on. All it does is show the apple logo as if its about to turn on but then it turns black seconds later and then repeats the cycle. She tried looking it up to the computer to see if its a software deal but the computer doesnt even detect the device when its connected. The iPad was used fairly often in the beginning but sat unused for at least a couple years. Has anyone experienced this before? Could it be a battery issue possibly?  I have a liking for cloud saving. However, I feel nervous whenever I authorize a 3rd party app to store files with its auto-backup/autosync feature because I have to allow them to control my files. Often times the prompt says that the app will have access to all my files, which makes me scared. If something goes awry, what is the worst possible scenario that can happen? Will I have a higher likelihood of losing all my files if one of these apps gets hacked/used for malicious intent?  Hey my computer got weird out of nowhere while i went to brush my teeth, the screen turned green and when it turned on, it was like fizzing or something, like old tvs, don't know how to explain, it would be easier to show.  I live in a quadplex and we dont actually have a router in the room but we get free Wi-Fi. is there a Wi-Fi booster I can buy that will improve my internet without needing to plug into the physical router?  Hi everyone,. I feel embarrassed asking this, but I'm a bit behind on how things work in the present-day FI world. Really just need a pointer in the right direction. I have a modern high-end laptop (W11 compatible) with an internal NVMe drive. Intending to wipe the drive, and create the following dual-boot setup:. 1) Windows 11 system installed on C C drive will be encrypted via BitLocker PM IN. 2) Secondary Windows 10 or Windows 11 system which will be installed on the D drive. No BitLocker. How would the logistics of this work? Since the primary system will be on an encrypted drive, but I don't want it to prompt for the IN unless I'm booking it. I think that the bootloaders nowadays live on the dedicated FI partition? So then I am assuming it shouldn't matter, because there would be no or system. The boot menu would simply load off of the FI partition, and then if I select option 1 -- it prompts me for the By password and boots the first system, and with option 2 -- it just boots the secondary system. Does this sound accurate and more or less straightforward? What do you think would be the best way to go about this? . Or, should I go with manually configuring GRB just to be safe? . Anything I should know? . Much thanks in advance!  Hi all, recently my mouse began sporadically disconnecting from my Px, even after trying multiple SB ports. In an attempt to fix this, I rebooted, but my keyboard did not turn on. The monitor, not receiving any input from the keyboard, quickly displayed the signal, entering power-saving error. Even after multiple restart and different SB ports, my Px and keyboard still remain unresponsive. Whats strange is that between the two keyboards I have tried, neither worked, but my camera did recognize that it was plugged in. Thank you for reading and please comment any solutions/suggestions you may have! . EDIT: This exact same problem has occurred once before a few months ago, but that time everything was working fine after a few hours.  So our printer will not accept requests to print currently. Tried from the iPhone, windows, and MacBook. Tried resetting the printer and router. I also uninstalled the printer from my laptop and now my computer cannot find it. Also printed the network config report and the In address seemed right. Any ideas?  So just a while ago i got windows blue screen error that could not read memory or something and the Px just destroyed itself. All the files on my drive got deleted including windows. I did a clean reinstall of windows 11 and each time is just gets a black screen with cursor. EAC TIME I reinstalled. I am so confused because nothing is working as it should I panicking! can someone please help me troubleshoot the issue and correctly reinstall windows 11? btw this includes the backups I had, they got deleted as well I have no idea what happened and I've tried finding safe mode but it isn't there for some reason? reinstalling everything, wiping the drive and starting over, and much much more.  I changed my phone number a week ago from T-Mobile and there has been some weird things that have happened ever since. First time I inserted my new sim in my phone, a while later I received Im guessing a scam text. This for example: ComEd: Your bill is ready to view for account ending 1080. Total Amount Due: Payment due date: 4/07/2022. Text TOP to stop all ComEd texts. I just randomly received that text a day after. Today when I was about to file my tax, I opened up turbo tax and have to confirm my phone number. There it was an another account linked to it, there was the persons email address and it said it was last accessed in May 2021. I moved from a different state and I told the employee that I want to keep the same area code from my hometown. Does that somehow may have to do with this?  I reset my laptop and in the middle of it, it suddenly turned off and not it isnt displaying.  I use a desktop computer. When I place the mouse cursor in the YouTube search field, a list of search suggestions appears. On the far right side of each suggestion is the word If I click on the word that suggestion is deleted. Suddenly this evening, the word isn't there at the right and I cannot delete any suggestion from history. I had seen this happen once or twice briefly in the last few days, but it always went away if I opened another browser tab. Now I cannot delete anything from the list (which I do to keep searches around that I'm still using). Changing browsers (from Firefox to Chrome) makes no difference and changing computers makes no difference. But if I log out and log into my wife's account, the word is back in the suggestion list. I haven't installed software for years and I have no recollection of changing my YouTube account settings. How can I restore the word so that I can delete suggestions in the list? Thanks in advance. Update: I've just notice that if I guide search by typing a letter in the search field, the new list has the word for the first few items. It used to have it for every item, even when I hadn't started typing yet.  I just walked away then came back and now it looks like this. (Halfway up the screen is just white lines). I have had it for 4-5 months now. Is it fixable, can I fix it?  SOLVED. It took me a few hours and I was really proud of it initially because it was turning on it was working and I got a green light on my motherboard when I finished. But I soon started having a lot of issues when it came to installing Windows on my new SD (name). I just installed a new installation media on my flash drive and it seems to be going fine every time that I try to redo the initial installation process. It always finished and it was able to boot into my SD. (I revid the installation media on my laptop to make sure it wasn't a bad write). The issue comes when I try to boot on my SD and it always goes to the screen with Cortina telling you to choose your region and the keyboard layout! Every single time after I put in my network details, it will say that Cortina is setting up some things and in between that my pc will always restart and it will send me into a recovery screen. I have tried everything I could within that recovery screen and nothing actually fixed the issue and it's been around two days of trying now. I also tried to give myself a Administrative privileges but even then, it would not allow me to login as administrator because I had the username and .

I imagine this is the graphics card shutting down as the computer continues to run but no signal is sent to the monitor. Anyone have any ideas of what can cause a P. C. to black screen or if there is any type of software I can download and run in the background that may collect data when it happens? I've got a 1080ti and an amd Ryzen 2700x if that matters, both are liquid cooled.  As the title says. My Px with a hardline Ethernet connection gets about 40 (lot lower when using wireless) Mbpss where as my iPhone connected to the same wifi gets 100+. Im confused as to what the issue is. If anyone could help me out it would be a big help.  Hi everyone, . I work overnight security in a tiny steel booth very far from any I-I signal. There a Px in here connected to internet but were not allowed to use it. Up until now Ive been using my phones hot spot to use my laptop but the data ran out and I feel like there has to be a more affordable solution to this problem. Any advice? ITA!  I usually use wireless headphones on when using my pc, but recently I had to resort to using a pair of cheap earphones (Sony MDREX15Ap). The audio came out fine but I had some issues with the pc blue screening and saying the was an issue with RTKVHD64. sys. I looked into and eventually got to the point where I reinstalled my audio drivers. The issue now is that the earphones are having issues getting recognized. In the sound settings the earphones are detected as (Realtek(R) and the sound comes out fine but then randomly they just disconnect and are no longer recognized. The weirdest part is that the microphone on the same pair of earphones doesn't have this issue and is recognized perfectly fine. They are both plugged firmly into the front headphones jack of the pc. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.  Anyone have a similar problem with the ps battery still draining while in hibernate or in shutdown? It seems like both options just put the computer into sleep mode which makes the battery dead by morning. Any tips before i try completely reinstalling windows?  So I had to download Adobe reader for a paper and I made the fatal mistake of giving it permission to download McAfee. I have since deleted McAfee but I still get the McAfee safe connect pop up. How do I get rid of this? I have restarted my computer after uninstalling for good measure as well.  Wiki help? Working on some devices but not others. Hello fellow reddit-ers,. Can anyone diagnose this problem and point to a solution? . I rent to 3 people in my house and for some reason every device is able to connect to the WII except one girls. Neither of her windows laptops connects, or her fire stick, or her printer. She got the fire stick because her chromecast didnt connect. But the 3 other fire sticks we have here do connect. And every other laptop. Her computers connect just fine on networks outside the house but not ours. Its worked in the past but shes the only one who has random days where none of her devices work. Today her computer says:. Windows Did Not Detect a Properly Installed Network Adapter. Is it her devices or could it be our Wiki? . ITA.  My internet has been shut off recently so I decided to try using my phones mobile hotspot to do homework/ sign in to games. When I connect the hotspot on my phone (iPhone X) to my computer, the only thing that will load is YouTube. I can go on to YouTube, browse the site, click on a video and watch it, but cant open any other site and steam will not open online either. This is really strange to me because I can watch a YouTube video at 720p with no suffering but nothing else will work. Any help would be much appreciated.  Im having a problem right now, my pc always boot super fast, but now a disc disappeared from the explorer, and now that disk is making my pc boot slow, if I disconnect it from the power the pc boots fast as normal but if I connect it again to the power, the pc boots slow, any way to recover that SD or is it lost for good?  Hey,. I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon 5th Gen that will not boot. When I press the power button, the power light goes on, keyboard backlight flashes, caps lock light on. The fan goes on briefly. Nothing happens, no video. No video on external monitor as well, using SB-C and DMI port. I have attempted to use the SB-C port to connect to a docking station and the external monitor does not work. Attempted using the DMI port, and it also does not work. I have pressed the hidden reset button on the back and held for 10-20 seconds. Took the laptop apart and removed the battery. Dressed the power button for 30 seconds with the battery removed. I have also disconnected the MOS battery. I have also pressed the hidden reset button with both batteries removed to try and reset everything. I put the laptop back together and it's the same problem. Everything I have seen online says its the system board that is sucked. Looks like I can purchase one for like which seems like a lot of money for something that might not fix the issue. I have no idea what could have caused this issue, it just stopped working out of the blue. Happened after I lent it to my mother in law and she said she didn't do anything. I cant really blame her, but I dont think she would tell me if she did something. Maybe its a failed IOS update that Lenovo loves trying to install on normal system updates. Anyone have any other bright ideas on how I can solve this problem? . Do you think I can purchase a used 5th Gen X1 Carbon on Bay for SD on ebay and swap the hard drive from my dead lap to the working one I bought? Or will that be a problem with actually booking from this SD? . Thanks for you help!  So after booking up my pc at the end of the day my laptop went into blue screen mode and said that it encountered an error and had to restart. Once the Px restarted there was some optimization and customization updates to my account which I filtered through and were mostly benign and nothing related to performance. After restarting I attempted to start up Ellen ring which I am now addicted to, and it took longer to boot and start than usual. I noticed that as soon as I got into the game that the frame rate was bad, really bad to the point where it kicked me out of online mode. I figured this was a problem with Ellen ring only to find that after starting several other games I encountered the same poor PS drop. It seems to even though I am in performance mode my fans do not start up which leads me to believe that there is some sort of error with my Px going into performance mode or there is a some sort of internal issue any thoughts?  Hi,. I'm trying to duplicate my 1440p screen to a 4k To using a splitter (no other available gpu ports available due to having 2 extra monitors. The splitter I've looked at mentions that they can split a 4k resolution to 2 different 4k monitors or a 4k and a 1080p, but never a combination of 4k and 1440p. I was wondering if this was possible?  I have a 128Gt SB that now has at least 80Gt of files on it (documents, pictures, M3 files, etc). I add and delete files from it weekly, and I've been using it to store files for over the past year and a half. Lately, when I plug it into my computer and open certain folders that hold a large amount of the files, I've been getting a loading icon and it takes longer for the file folders to open and displace the file icons. I'm not sure if this is just due to the volume of files that I have on the SB, or if it's cause for concern about the condition of the SB itself.  I suspect it has something to do with having many tabs open, but only recently has this happened to me. Also, though I'm not sure if this is related, the game would just freeze, then black screen, then a radon software pop-up window will pop-up. After checking device manager, it would always say that the PU is disabled. I've mostly seen it happen when playing genshin with around 3 windows open, sometimes other games too. Specs: . CPU - r3 3100. AM - 16gb. PU - rx580. SU - 600w.  I'm using a Windows 10 desktop Px with a 1To DD. I want to use the Music folder as, well, a music folder. But if I optimize the folder for in the folder settings, it's insanely slow. The green loading bar can take over a minute to complete, and if I scroll down, it freezes for several seconds. Optimizing the folder for eliminates the speed issue entirely, but it also removes all the columns that tell me about each file's album, artist, nitrate, etc. When I try adding them back, the folder slows way down. Why does this happen? How can I speed up the music folder so it's usable again? For what it's worth, I have probably fewer than 1,000 total items in this folder, and it was already really slow before it got to this amount.  Have been airdropping from my laptop to my Mac for about a year and all of a sudden its not discoverable anymore? I have applied the discovered by setting and it's also turned on in my firewall settings. Any help appreciated :).  I'm really confused what program to use to open those files. Type of file: TE File (. ute).  When i search a job in indeed, all that shows up is a page with just a single When i use microsoft edge theres no problem but i just really wanna fix my problem with chrome.  I just got a pair of kraken kitty headphones and connected them to my Px (windows 10) they worked for about 15 minutes before my intel bluetooth driver went out. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver manually, ran a sfc scan, have tried everything the internet told me to lol. bluetooth still isnt working, if anyone has had this issue please let me know help if possible. It was working fine before :(.  Recently videos have been playing with this black border like square on half the video. The video is also not synced on both halves, one is slightly delayed. It does not happen on youtube videos, just Gift or similar it seems. Any ideas? .  Main issue is when I'm on discord and I try to upload a file discord will crash, but also on chrome when I open it, it itself will crash and I'm obviously not able to upload my file.  I factory reset my Lenovo desktop and now when I press the power button it just shows the name for hours, no spinning thing ,nothing.  Hey all, to get to the point:. I have a good Px, and I have it hooked up to a 42inch 4k To. I have my resolution set to the recommended 3840x2160. I have to have the scaling set to 225% so everything isn't super tiny. However, when I'm scrolling websites and a small video ad pops up, the screen goes completely black for a second and I lose all sound - it comes back immediately after and the small video will play. This also happens when I scroll over a tool in the hotbar on Illustrator - when the little video pops up to play a preview of what the tool does, on the Xbox Px store playing a preview of a game if I scroll over it, etc. You get the point. Just anytime a small video pops up somewhere on my screen. Any ideas what this could be? Thanks in advance!  Hey guys, my computer's been working fine since it returned from the store (after they replaced a faulty motherboard). And after like a month, it started freezing completely and all I can do is turn the power switch off in the back. Before I return it to the store, is there anything I can do myself to figure out the problem? . So far all I've done is check if it freezes again without me opening any programs, just letting it sit in the desktop and 3-5 minutes later it froze when only the task manager was open. The memory was at 99% for some time after I turned the Px on, and then went down to 48%, after a few seconds it froze. I did not overclock, Bios are set to default. Is this definitely a hardware issue? Or could this be caused by software? . Thanks in advance!  My ps4 is getting really slow recently and i dont know why, also it feels somewhat overheating, so yeah, if anyone knows how to improve the situation please let me know.  I live in a college dorm. Currently its spring break so the majority of the student body went home while a couple others like myself stayed behind. Here the problem: ever since break started last week, I have been getting connection errors. I play a number of mmorpg games and every time I open any of them (steam/epic games/En), the Wiki instantly disconnect. Drivers are up to date, reconnected to Wiki multiple times after forget this network, restarted laptop. still nothing. My laptop is SI Gt65. Bandwidth is 250maps and I have no access to router. Please help and thank you in advanced.  Hello, I am not very good at this but I am desperate and need opinions. I installed a new CPU (5900x) from a 3800x along with 2x16 3600 mhz Corsair vengeance. Initially my system wouldn't boot until I put it into csm mode, it boots and everything is super laggy and stuttery, but it seems all my stats (temps loads etc) were mostly normal. I used 3d mark and got 20 fps. After doing multiple things like driver installs bios update fresh windows install nothing has helped besides turning amp off, or blocking the memory differently (instead of 16-18-18-36 3600 mhz I'd go to 18-22-22-42 and get much better benchmark scores) . On 2 occasions I got it to run very well but on restart it started begging out again. What steps can I take now? The ram is in the correct slots, temps haven't gone over 75c. Specs . 5900x. 3070ti. 2x16 Corsair 3600mhz ram. Si x570 pro carbon wifi . 850w newer Corsair psu. Edit: open hardware monitor says 90% but task manager says 30% PU usage.  I have never had any other problems with this pc its new only about 5 months old this problem only started within the last two months started out could play for hours then when reboot and then it happened every hour then every 15 min now its within seconds I replaced the power supply tonight turned it on and it still is happening any help or fixes would be great.

I helped my friend replace the motherboard and CPU in his Px about a week ago. Everything worked fine Pre-Swap, after we put the new parts in and booted the computer it went to IOS. Neither his Hard Drive or His SD show up as boot options in IOS. IOS states that both the drive and the SD are connected and recognized, but neither of them are options to boot from. We have tried everything over the past week and haven't found a solution yet. The farthest we have gotten besides IOS is when we tried the Windows Install Tool today and we got to the Tool but when it came to select a drive to install Windows on, neither the Hard Drive nor the SD were options. It showed 0 options to install to but they both still are recognized in IOS as being connected to the motherboard fine. Any help is appreciated.  recently, my computer has been constantly entering a blue screen loop where it says it runs into an issue and needs to restart. It's currently ok as system image restore seems to have solved it, but this issue always pops up immediately after restarting for new updates. Is there some way to fix this. dump:.  I moved houses and now my monitor has vertical black lines stretching over the whole monitor. I updated drivers and everything what do I do?  I'm using a SB C to 3. 5mm dongle with my computer and plug my headphones into that. Almost every time I put my Px to sleep for a while and wake it up, Windows fails to detect the dongle and I have no audio. Other times it works fine. The only way to fix it to plug it in again. HY? I need to figure this out, it's driving me up the wall.  I can't figure out whether this is a mouse problem or a SB port problem. My mouse stops working maybe once a day. If I switch it to a different SB port it starts working again with no issues. At some point, it stops again, and switching back to the original port fixes it. And so on, back and forth. What do you reckon? Faculty mouse? Faculty SB ports? Something else?  I have a dell laptop using windows 10. Ive not had a problem on any other network and my phone hotspot also works perfectly. But for some reason the wifi at home will randomly drop from my laptop. I suspect its a problem with the laptops Wiki adapter, but Ive tried every solution in the book. When it works it is great - I get full connection strenh, but it randomly drops for up to 30min at a time. I also have am using 6 SB ports - which id why it would be a problem thought I would mention id if it might be throwing something off. Things Ive tried:. -Restarted Px. -Ran troubleshooters. -Uninstalled/reinstalled drivers. -Reset network settings. -Released/Renewed In configuration. -Reset Route. -Uninstalled antivirus. -Many other things. I also use default network settings so niche fixes like switching something from Manuel to automatic wouldnt apply. The kicker though - when I move my laptop closer to the router is starts working, which would make you think it was a problem with the router, but again i get full strenh in my usual position and no other device, including another dell laptop I have, have this issue. The errors I receive from the troubleshooter relate to wifi adapter or In address. Does anyone have any ideas?  When I click the properties, it shows Service Status: Stopped. Then, I click Start, but just shows error message. I'm on Windows 10. The Windows Audio Endpoint Builder is Running and in Automatic.  hey my phone screen at the top is separated from the case help me please.  I've been having this issue for a few months now. Sometimes when I play games or scroll on webpages my screen begins to flicker by changing colours to bright and normal. This can be really distracting when I'm gaming or working for school. Does anybody know what the cause of this is? . Things I've done so far:. - Updated my PU-drivers and Bios drivers. - with settings of the monitor to see if that changed anything (it - Download and installed monitor drivers, but with no success of solving the problem. Monitor: AUS V24V curved with 120Hz refresh rate (144Hz max. ).  Hi, so since recently i sometimes have problems with sudden, heavy stuttering in audio/video and general activity (hovering over icons, opening task manager etc. ) . I just looked a bit into it and found somewhere to look for outdated drivers. Well, there suddenly is a never seen before with the following hardware-Is:. i googled them and found something related to intel notebooks, which doesnt make any sense since im on a desktop-Px. Are these problems related? How can i fix this?  I have already put it in but I don't know how to make it work. I trying to watch tutorials but all I got was go to website plus in flash drive push unknown buttons and boom your done. I trying to see how big windows 10 to see if there's enough space on my flash drive.  As the title says after alt-stabbing from a game a stabbing back in my fps has a significant increase of around 200% for a short while (depends how long i alt-tab) then a drop back down. For an example of destiny 2 (the game where this is happening), I will get 90-120 fps in game playing after alt-stabbing, and short after I will get a stuttery 40. I have literally re-installed windows and all my drivers along with updating bios and no fix (at least it used to do this too I believe). I am on a PS 15 9510, my destiny 2 is usually running at the default low settings.  I have two choices: try to find six D batteries or use a 12v plug. The fan is just a standard fan that blows air - not like a computer fan or anything - and I cant find the 9v plug that went with it. I do however have a 12v plug that I found in a drawer. Will the fan catch on fire or anything if I try to use it? My room gets super hot at night and Im not allowed to have the windows open for some reason. Im not sure if Im in the right place, and if Im not I would appreciate being pointed to the correct sub to ask this.  I recently upgraded from a ryzen 3600 to a ryzen 5600x on an msi mpg x570 mb. Upgraded my bios in the process. Components have been overclocked but during the process they were in default settings. Everything was fine before the upgrade. Pc will load into home screen but skips bios splash screen. Tried resetting cms battery by removing for a couple minutes. Recovery settings such as EFI firmware settings dont boot back up. Turns off my screen but the pc is still running. Connected to one monitor. Tried switching display cables swell. Any ideas. Many thanks.  At some point in the last few days, files changed so that they always save. Previously it gave me an option to either open or save. How can I revert this back to give me that option?  Hello, I have established a site-to-site vpn connection (router-to-router) and I ma kinda testing it. It seems when I connect my personal laptop/cellphone through this vpn connection my real ip is hidden. When I try this with my employer-laptop at home the real ip shows when I search in browser In The employer laptop is a Windows 10 Dell and the Location feature is Of and can only be changed by an Admin. On the other hand the Wi-fi is FF and and the laptop is connected to my router with a wire. How can I circumvent this? How can I make that my real ip hidden when I work on my employer laptop? Thanks.  I rebooted my pc on the weekend and suddenly the monitor doesn't get signal. I tried new cables, no dice. the monitor can display a Switch no problem with thr same cables. I took my pc and my monitor to Geeksquad, they connected them no problem and had it display correctly. I take it home, do exactly as they did, and it still doesn't work. I sound like I'm insane and honestly it's driving me insane for real. the hdi is in the same ports as they used, even the same hdi they used because they gave it to me, but no signal.  Running:. Win 11 Home 64. I7 8700k. msi rt 3090. z390 AORUS Ultra-cf. When i use the power button to power on the desktop it boots to a blue recover screen with 2 options. pressing f1 for recovery options does nothing. Pressing esc reboot the pc, where it then enters the bios. Editing the bios and rebooting then boots normally without any issue to my desktop. I tried resetting the bios to no avail. The only other thing i can think of is an issue with the boot drive, but that doesn't explain the weird inconsistent behavior.  Whenever I try to write on a pdf document with the apple pencil it almost immediately deletes them without me even closing the file. I've never had this issue before, and I've tried deleting and saving a new copy of the file. I would be grateful if anyone had any advice on how to fix this.  Also in the it shows the correct time. (my country does not use daylight savings).  After a trojan scare, I reinstalled Windows 10 on my other Px. Clean install from an ISO downloaded on a different computer. Just to be safe, I went over it afterward in safe mode with kill, Malwarebytes, and AdwCleaner. They found nothing miss. Then I used HitmanPro. Along with flagging some He PUAs (that I left alone), HitmanPro had listed at the bottom, saying that it was changed yesterday so it's suspicious. But:. VirusTotal found nothing wrong with it. The file also isn't flagged when I use HitmanPro outside of safe mode. Was it using safe mode? Or is this a deeper problem that isn't being caught?  Firstly, I am sorry if this question has been beat to death, but I haven't had any luck with Google. I have just built a new pc and as the title states I cannot get windows installed. It will boot to the drive and the windows logo appears. It will infinitely load from here. If I enable SM and from Storage set to it will get to the windows logo. If SM is not enabled I will only get to the splash screen which also infinitely loads. I have enabled/disabled fast boot. I am booking to EFI SB that has been formatted and has the windows media creation tool downloaded to it. I have confirmed that the drive is properly working by booking to it on my other pc. I have tried repeating and switching out AM as well as pulling the MOS battery. Anyone have any other ideas? Messing with IOS settings is new to me. Thank you in advance for the help. Specs:.

Hhh I don't know how to describe what happened. so basically I left my computer on and went to school this morning, I got home and see something weird, all my desktop icons are scattered all over the place and some music I had playing was stuck on repeat and I couldn't close Spotify, I also noticed all other applications were closed including things like wallpaper engine. I restarted my computer and all my icons are now gone and all the games that I had on here were also uninstalled. so is there a way to make my computer load up back to a previous day or something or am I gonna have to go into files and manually make shortcuts for everything?  tl:dr I backed up my computer to an external drive but the drive appears to have deleted most of them. Disk utility says 15b Gt of 2To used but when I open the drive there's only 2Gt worth of files showing. Is there a possibility the files I lost are still there? . My Early 2015 MacBook Pro was starting to get slow a few weeks ago since I was running out of space so I decided to go ahead and back it up wipe it and restart. I used a 2To Seagate External Hard Drive that I originally purchased for my Xbox but have been using as an external drive for my MacBook for a few months now with no issues. Before I began the backup I had about 2 To worth of projects I've spent a long time working on. Since I had a bunch of unused files on my MacBook I manually sorted through everything instead of using Time Machine. Moved everything I wanted to keep onto the drive (including the files that were natively stored not he drive) ejected and wiped my computer. After setting my computer up again (running macOS Catalina like before bc I don't like upgrading) I plugged in the drive and to my shock only the last fee items I moved were there. Originally I had given in and just accepted that I had bad luck but I decided to add up the space of all the files and it came to about 1. 8 Gt whereas Disk Utility says the drive has 15Gt used. Are the files I'm missing possibly still on the drive? Maybe they are hidden like how Windows hides folders like %AppData%? If this is even a possibility how do I go about getting them to show? Is it more likely they are corrupted? . I figure they are probably gone forever and I'll have to just start my projects over but I figured I would ask around before officially giving up.  So for a few days now my Lt smart To has been connecting and disconnecting to the Wiki and now its greed out the on off in the Wiki settings and is stuck on off I've unplugged my To and factory reset it followed YouTube tutorials and Lt tutorials on YouTube and the Internet (works fine on everything else) but nothing works I'm not steady handed enough to undo the back and look at the Bluetooth thing like it said on one tutorial and I don't want to permanently mess my To up somehow because when it comes to technical things I know what to do if not I research so I don't break or mess anything up I'm afraid that if I call them that they'll talk me through a bunch that I couldn't do and if they say it's an insurance situation due to money problems a mum who don't listen and bad money spending habits I'm pretty sure they have stopped my insurance.  I have a work computer that has two monitors and I work from home and I would like to add a new monitor. However I can not install any drivers. Due to restrictions, is there a way to add a monitor without having to install drivers, the back of the computer has one via port and a display port, grouped and one display port off by its self.

Px crashes after download starts on Xbox Game Pass. This has happened while attempting to download multiple games.  I have a device that has two drives in it, but just this morning, when I plugged it in, it won't show up on my computer. I checked for hidden folders, and there was only one drive, but it had no space or anything whatsoever. Disk Manager says . Any help? Did the SB die?  For about the past 2 months whenever I go off of wifi I wont be able to go to certain sites. Theyll be blocked and say something like this page has been blocked or is dangerous off of wifi. When I click advance to site anyway it still doesnt work. This also happens on YouTube where when Im in wifi its fine but when Im off of it restricted just gets turned on randomly and Im not able to turn it off. Ive tried Scoring my phone settings and couldnt find anything to fix it as well as checking to see if for some reason the parental controls on T-Mobile got turned on but that wasnt it either. Really stamped here.  Hi, I'm sorry I don't really know where to ask this. I tried Googling but found no result, I can't find suitable keywords for this question. Many articles said that gpu can accelerate the pc by doing decoding on hardware, it can alleviate CPU's workload so CPU can do other things instead. My question is: Integrated PU is embedded in CPU and therefore shares resources with CPU, which means it's the CPU that's doing all the work? Does it make hardware decoding not effective on Integrated PU?  my Px was literally running perfectly and I restarted it to change something and I started getting the error. please help me before I lose my mind.  I was working on my Px, I booted it up to check something (and it worked as per usual), then I booted it again about 10 minutes later, but now it wont turn on A ALL. It looks completely dead, but I promise that its plugged in (and in a working outlet). I dont really remember what I did in those 10 minutes, but it wasnt anything huge. I was messing with some cables, but nothing was (purposefully) unplugged. Anything Ive checked is plugged in snugly on the motherboard and SU. And, not to be that guy, but please dont reply with any obvious solutions. Ive been troubleshooting for an hour, so Ive gotten that out of the way many times.  I have a few things plugged into my SB 3 ports but my Px detects them as SB 2 devices. Anyone know why (btw I'm checking through regular windows settings and the devices say Could Perform Better with SB 3. 0 or smith like that).

The message that pops up relates to not being able to read / open the app. The data on the floppy was developed with C++, Sequel (sorry if I am not referring to this correctly, I have zero tech knowledge) and with M from the . Any advice on how the floppy can be opened?  I usually have to restart once a day to get this fixed but it leads me to a BSD that says I've downloaded Px HelpSoft Driver Update to scan for drivers that aren't up to date but everything is up to date. It usually takes a long time to collect data then restart but this morning it restarted quickly and went into a black screen before I manually reset the Px. I think it's a rogue driver from what I've read online but I seem to be the only one with this problem. None have been able to help. Please help me, I just built the pc and it's new. I've built pcs before but this is the first time I've encountered this. I'm 19 . Specs: . CPU: r5 5600x. PU: TX 3070. AM: 32 gb 2900. Memory: 1tb samsung ssd 970 evo.  Hi, I'm not sure if I used the wrong flair but I need help archiving(? ) my schools google drive content. After I graduate staff told me they would lock my account so I couldn't access my school account. I was wondering how I can save all the files without taking up a huge amount of space on my computer Thank you and once again, apologies if I used the wrong flair.  I do school from home and have been for months. basically i got really sick and was in and out of the hospital using my own personal laptop instead of the school issued one. On my laptop i have a vpn that i dont bother to turn off. For the past 6 weeks ive done my reading on this specific computer. My professor is now saying it only shows ive done 1/4 of the readings in total. Could my vpn be blocking the verification process that the schooling site uses?  Over the past few weeks I noticed my display flickering when I play any games. I've tried a clean install of the nvidia drivers, tried different cables, but so far no luck fixing this. I've noticed the flickering starts when the in-game PS gets down to about 60PS, which is usually on the title screens. When the frame rate is well over 120 and I don't have the issue while playing. I'm beginning to think it might be an issue with the monitor itself. My current setup is:. NVIDIA GeForce TX 3060 Ti 8Gt GDR6. Drivers are the most recent. Alienware monitor A2721D. Alienware Aurora R12, Intel i7, 3. 6Gh, 32Gt ram. (just upgraded from 16Gt 2 weeks ago. related? ). Windows 10, 64bit. Has anyone else come across this? Thoughts what could be causing this issue? Recommendations on other things to try?  Hello,. Just want to make sure this isn't a leaking battery, or that my phone won't explode at 23000 feet as a result. Phone works fine, stuff doesn't seem to smell, can be scrapped off, has been recent (circa -5 months) phone is maybe 4+ years old.  My PU has been randomly cutting off output until I restart my Px. (SI TX 3080). My professor at school let me borrow his spare gpu, but when I plugged it in, it wasnt working. So I uninstalled it and put my PU back in (which was working roughly 2 hours ago, albeit with the issue states above). Now the lights turn on, the fans spin, for ALL parts including gpu, but I get 0 output. Please help! I rely on this pc mainly to get my schoolwork done. I will fail college without it. EDIT: Solved. The issue was that I was too stressed and on the verge of a panic attack to realize I had two DMI cords on my desk, and the one I had in the monitor and the one I was using on the GPU were different and not connecting the two hardware pieces. Thank you so much for any help provided. Im going to calm down before I continue to work on my Px.  Recently moved and started service with a local SP. They dropped my modem/router off today and I got going on setting it up. All the lights are solid green. My phone showed connected, so the 2. 4 and 5 gh networks are being broadcast, and I am able to load some web pages. My To was having trouble connecting and in the midst of trying to solve that I noticed my phone was prompting me to sign into the network. I clicked that prompt and it brought me to a Spectrum activation page. It gets weirder. I called tech support and they couldn't connect to my modem and informed me that I need to activate my service through their website. I thought okay that might be the problem so I went there and that also redirected to the same Spectrum activation website. I've called my SP support twice, each ended at the same place. My SP rep is also baffled. Spectrum support couldn't help me. So maybe someone has some advice so I don't have to wait a week for a tech to come out.  So I recently got an obsolete piece of technology solely for playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and maybe some other old 360 games. However, this thing just won't connect to the wifi in our house despite the password being entered correctly and we have pretty good wifi. My original Xbox 360 connects to the wifi just fine with its dongle, but the Slim shouldn't even need to use that, right? Has anyone ever had this issue? Is it console banned? If anyone has some insight that would be great. I've tried everything too. Tried resetting the modem, tried turning off the encryption and the firewall. Even turned the wifi off on all the phones in the house. I know this seems hopeless, but I really just wanna be able to have wifi and save my data on this Slim. My other Xbox is unfortunately dying.  I have to share bad news with you. Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing. After that, I have started tracking your internet activities. Some time ago I hacked you and got access to your email accounts: (school e-mail, one i barely use) . Obviously, I have easily hack to log in to your email. Your password: (password). One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email. In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails). All ingenious is simple. software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e. g. , your microphone, video camera and keyboard). I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers. I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list. My virus continuously refreshed the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter. While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites. You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montage a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasm. If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives. I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access. I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you. Let's settle it this way:You transfer SD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away. After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivated and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word. This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now. In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine. Here is my bitcoin wallet: (his wallet, dont know if i should share here? ). Things you need to avoid from not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are try to reinstall the Of on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers. Things you don't need to worry I won't be able to receive your funds transfer. - Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer. - Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago! . Everything will be done in a fair manner! . One more thing. Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future! My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis. P. S. : one of details Im referring to is the spicy part above. Re-installing Vast hopefully will do something (detected no malware ofc, but said my webcam is vulnerable, any tips for that? ). Its weird because it would me 100x more effective if he had included one of those and the social media part. I have 2fa so I would get a message if someone tried to log in, right? . EDIT: found out its indeed a fake blackmail, still would like to hear your thoughts.  Hi I use windows 10 and whenever anything is right clicked on home screen or windows explorer my mouse pointer does the loading circle thing forever and it doesn't turn back to normal again can anyone help?  Pretty much title -- When I first installed it over a year ago, it didn't have any problems. Then one day it randomly disappeared, ever since then it's been on and off. After my most recent re-seat, it was available for 3 days until disappearing from my drives. My friends think its a mob curious to hear thoughts here. Motherboard: . SD:.  I have a charging cable for my iPhone and it doesnt show to be charging while plugged in, but when my phone dies or it is turned off and i plug it in, it turns on and shows charging (the battery logo doesnt have the charging cable when the phone is dead) this has happened with the majority of my cables over time.  What would you have to do to use that much data? Does making calls over Facebook messenger use a lot of data? What about void? Would watching videos on Facebook use that much data?  I'm trying to set up another computer I have for some game stuff I'm doing. I do a complete reset on it. No idea how a virus would slip on. I go and install chrome, that goes fine. I sign in, YouTube works fine. I try to install discord, site doesn't respond. I use the troubleshooting, it says that there isn't problems detected in my network, but it still can't connect to the site. I try other sites. Reddit doesn't work, Twitter doesn't work, nexus mods doesn't work. Any idea on why certain sites are not loading? I have another computer with the same Google account logged in and everything is fine.  This issue started happening recently, and as occurred twice now. The first time it happened I was watching some videos, the second one I was playing a videogame when it completely froze and after a few seconds the problem happened. The problem is basically the screen starts getting darker until the point where it gets completely grey, and then it just freezes there until I force shutdown de pc. When this occurs after I turn the pc on again, theres like a little twinkling in the screen that only goes away after I let the pc off for some minutes.  Does the ACE KB2 series come with outlets that let me plug in speakers ? I have a M24fe monitor and would like to switch monitors looking for one with an audio port so I can hear whats coming from my Monitor.  So I got into V with a quest 2 and now need to update my PU. Well my current Px has a 180 watt Chinese power supply that wont do it so I went out and bought a new 700 watt SU. As Ive never built a Px or even opened one up until this, it seems I do not have a 24 pin motherboard power receptacle on my motherboard. There are 3 connectors from my stock SU. 1. PWRCMD (not sure how many pins). 2. CPU_WR (4 pin). 3. SS WR P1 (4 pin). There also wires plugged into my motherboard that connect to nothing not too sure what thats about. Here are some pictures of my computer: . Any help for this newbie is much appreciated My X 6600 is set to come in Wednesday so Im hoping I can make due and get this sorted out. Cheers. Edit: this may be solved. After much research and talking with a few companies I believe the L05757-800 500 watt He power supply will work.  This issue started seemingly out of nowhere has been hard to diagnose because the laptop can freeze at any time, including a couple seconds after turning it on and while inside the bios menu. With freeze i mean, the screen will freeze the image at the time it stops then cant do anything else other than turning the power off. On rare occasions, it will freeze for a second then become normal until eventually freezing permanently. I've managed to run lenovo vantage diagnostics and it detected no issues. Considering it can freeze a couple of seconds after turning it on and while in the bios im guessing this is not a driver issue and been thinking it's something with the AM i've been trying to run memtest but i cant seen to keep the laptop running for long enough before it gets any results from the test (i should be able to get it eventually but going to need a lot of tries). extra note, i had a BSD at one point which said WHA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR unfortunately i couldn't get the dump file because it froze right after the BSD. Anyone knows what's up with this or how can i diagnose the issue?  Hello, the headphones are BL tune 500 and I got them on Christmas but now the sound has stopped coming through the left side. The right side is the side with the cord. I already checked and My audio settings are normal. I'm not on the mono audio. I take care of them and only put them in my backpack a few times because I brought them to school. Any help is appreciated.  So basically Ive been using an Amazon basics wireless mouse for my laptop, but I brought my laptop somewhere without it and I kept the little usb from the mouse inside the laptop. Now it wont connect. Is there a way to fix this or am I screwed?  Just installed two new ram sticks in place of old. Rooted up pc and my main monitor is the only display working, says second display is not detected.  Hi all,. Im having issues with my tower Px restarting. The behaviour started about 2 weeks ago after some heavy use (video rendering, 100% cpu usage). The computer now turns of sporadically: works fine for 2+ hours then will turn off, shut off two or three times, then work normally for a few minutes then turn off again, etc. No particular behaviour makes it turn off (turns off while dling, or under moderate use). Computer turns off in Bios as well as in windows, but more often in windows (but then I use windows more often :) ). The Px (roughly 2 years old except the graphics card). Intel i9-9900k. Gigabyte 3080ti. Gigabyte torus master motherboard. 32 gb corsair ram, amp enabled. 750 watt corsair power supply. Water cooled cpu h100i. Windows 11. No overclocking. Things I have tried. 1. Cooling - dont think its this. 1. 7 fans in the pc. 2. Cup and gpu temps monitored with afterburners, while dling they dont go above 40c, under load not over 75c. 3. Neither power supply or computer feel hot. 2. Power supply - Could be this, but given the power supply is (i think? ) a higher quality and not that old ( 2 years)? Dont know. 3. Tried doing image check, disk check via windows, no problems. 4. No errors listed in device manager. 5. No changes to hardware since this started happening, no significant changes to software. 6. computer plugged directly into wall, no shock protection things. 7. inside of the computer is spotless in terms of dust, dust filters at every entry point. My best (uneducated) guess. 1. Faculty AM? . 2. Faculty CPU? . 3. Faculty power supply? . Thanks in advance!  Whenever I get an error, like the usual error tone is played in windows, my entire screen goes inverted colors for about half a second. This is super annoying, especially when working at night in a dark mode application and I get flash banned randomly. Thanks in advance if you can help me.  Sorry if this isnt an articulate description. Im trying to watch shows on Paramount Plus (but Ive had this issue with a variety of websites). Every time I try to load a video, I get an error saying I need to turn off ad blockers. I turned ad blocking off within my browser, and also tried a number of different browsers (edge, chrome, Firefox) with the same result. It also happens on Safari and in the app on my iPhone. The only way Ive been able to avoid the error message is to turn off Wiki on my phone and watch using data in the app, which isnt ideal. Process of elimination tells me it has to be my router (linksys) or internet provider (Cox) causing this issue. Any thoughts on how to resolve this? I just want to watch Bar Rescue.  I keep getting a failed PU stress test result in MD Adrenaline Edition software when run for 10 minutes. Temps are okay, and there are no crashes.

Should I Uninstaller windows on my had after? Should I just move windows? What the right move here.  I'm on Windows 10 Home and it's very sporadic. Not sure what's causing it. It's happened with a Px4 and Xbox series X controller. I tried doing everything I feel like I could in the bluetooth settings, nothing seems to work. Also would getting this fix it? . Does anyone know? . I'd prefer to not have something sticking out of my laptop because I game with the laptop on my lap but if it's what I have to do to stop this problem then I'd consider it because it's getting annoying and getting my killed in games.  So i'm running into a little bit of a problem. I use a C920E webcam, and a Rode A1-I audio interface. Both device use SB 2. 0, and the Rode A1-I audio interface needs power to provide 48v phantom power. Can i plug them both into a powered SB-UB and have my Px handle data transfer only? . It's a pretty old Px, but once everything is booted, everything is fine. But i do have to unplug, and reconnect my Rode audio interface or els it wont power on after the initial boot cycle. Can a powered SB hub solve my problems? . I think my SB US is trying to draw too much power and the audio interface disconnect because of it.  My Lenovo X1 laptop is often connected to an external monitor. Every time I use the laptop outside of the home, ran down the battery (low battery warning appears), the laptop will not give out monitor signal (i. e no signal detected) after I return home, even if it is connected to a power source and is charging. Computer restart does not help. The no signal issue will resolve itself after 24-36 hours connected to the power source. The laptop has 2 graphics port, usb-c and hdi. They both fail/work at the same time. Is this a graphics card issue, a battery issue or a power saving setting issue. Thank you for your help!  I have the impression that the discharging process is slower in the phone. Does that really happen? . Thanks!  I have never seen such an odd problem in my few years of helpdesk. Working with a dell precision 5550 which lost wireless communications (2. 4gh network) mid-day today. No updates from windows since the 10th. Wiki is connected to the home SID, (connected, secured). Nslookup google is successful. Ping google successful,. Chrome / edge and all applications fail to connect to the internet. Tried. Restart, power drain, forget network, flush dns, sfc scans, rolling back driver, checking for updates. Wings still working, all apps failing to connect as if there is no internet. Ever seen something like that?  I have an H510 case, and the front two (pre installed) fans still work fine, but the ones that I just installed in the back wont light up. I daisy chained them, but that didnt work, so I tried connecting them directly the the ED hub, and they still didnt work. I have no clue why this is, and some hell would be appreciated.  So some of my keys on my laptop wont work unless I press hard on it for a long time, but it stops working after a few minutes or when I shut off the laptop. What should I do? Ive tried cleaning it, updating the drivers, and going into safe mode. I dont know if its hardware or software.  Hello everyone, I just built my first pc which took me a couple of days, but my case has only 1 fan on the lower right while my cpu is on the top right, but the actual problem is that my cpu stays between 90-98C when playing games and I was wondering if it could damage my cpu or other components inside my case. I also cannot add fans right now since some are too big.  Also r/techsupport,. I am very bad at In but am trying to improve, I hope someone here can offer a helpful suggestion! . I bought my husband and I these gaming laptops:. they're great for playing Vale! We did replace the wifi cards after getting some high ping in game, and that worked like a charm. Now we're trying to go from playing on the couch to playing on desks, which includes some external peripherals. This presented a unique challenge when we realized that we bought laptops without DMI ports (fail). So to amend that we got these SB/DMI converters:. It works great when we plug them into our smaller external monitors, but were hoping to game on the Based on some googling it would seem I should be able to set the resolution to 3440x1440, but the max setting is 1920x1080 which it says is recommended but honestly looks really bad. The scale is blown up and the edges of the Valorant game client are cut off of the screen. I would figure out how to put a screen shot in here for your reference but just imagine it looks horrible and gross and you wouldn't want to play on it :). So I realize the problem was probably getting a gaming laptop for Vale in the first place instead of an external case with the proper ports. Is there an easy fix I don't know about to get the hardware i've purchased to date to work how I'm intending? Appreciate any tips you can throw my way! I know it has SB-C ports, if I got that kind of converter might it work better for some reason?  Hi, a couple of days ago I bought an external SB webcam. At the moment I tried using it on one laptop with win10 and one with Linux, In both cases, the camera works just fine by simply plugging it. The problem that I have is when I want to use it in my Px, I plug the SB, the led power on the camera lights up but the Of doesn't recognize that something was plugged in. I tried plugging the camera in all the SB ports, different operating systems ( I have one SD with win10 and one with Linux) and nothing works. It's driving me crazy.  I've noticed this check box existing in Properties of C: for several Windows versions now but have never seen it checked. Why is this not only enabled by default but in all my years I've never seen a system it was enabled on. How much compression does it do how much space could a person expect to save? . Judging by the fact I've never seen it enabled even once on a Px is it generally recommended not to enable it does it tend to break things?  I found out I have a lot of different audio devices in my Device Manager. Do I even need all of them ? . (MD High Definition Audio, MD Streaming Audio, High Definition Audio, Realtek Audio).  Hi everyone,. I inherited a T480 from a family member. Computer runs great, except both the internal and removable battery would not charge (only works if I have it plugged in). I've checked the battery and confirmed it is a genuine Lenovo battery (also verbally confirmed with family member that it is the original battery that came with the laptop, purchased brand new from Lenovo). Things I've tried so far without luck:. resetting with the paperclip on pin. remove battery and hold the power button for 30 seconds. format and reinstall window from scratch. update driver. I've also see suggestions to update Bios, but I am unable as there is a check to prevent bios update if battery is low. Wonder if anyone have other suggestions? . Thanks.  Basically the title . When I boot up my computer my entire desktop is covered by some application and I can't figure out what it is. It is just a black screen and I can see my cursor, and dragging the cursor to the bottom will slide up the Taskbar. I can open up applications from the Taskbar and hovering over them from the Taskbar to show me a preview of them works, and I can see the rest of my desktop in the process. However, clicking on an application or going away from the preview will bring back the black screen, and no applications are allowed on top of it. After 2-3 minutes the screen just goes away and I am unsure of what causes it. Task Manager, which I currently have set to be on and this goes on top of the black screen, shows me that no applications are running. I tried ending a few background processes but nothing worked. I disabled all startup applications from Task Manager but it still does it. I have no clue what this application is. If I left or right click on it while it is there, windows makes its traditional little error noise when you click somewhere that you . Windows 10, latest version. This started happening after restoring a system image. Didn't happen before.  I have an AUS RG Crosshair III Hero w/ Wiki and Bluetooth compatibility. I very recently discovered that the mob came with an adapter that I never used. During that time, Windows did detect that I had Bluetooth compatibility but it never worked. After connecting the adapter to the In port, I restarted the computer and suddenly, Windows stopped reading my computer as Bluetooth compatible. I then realized the drivers were hidden in the device manager but I couldn't find a way to unhide them. I assumed the drivers were corrupted so I uninstalled them from the hidden section but now Windows won't even try to reinstall them after a restart. Windows Updates isn't attempting to either. I tried manually installing them through Intel and AUS but nothing happens. Bluetooth literally does not exist on my Px anymore. Any advice?  Hello. So this might sound weird. Do you guys know the vertical line that goes on and off when writing something? Well, the same line started appearing whenever I click on something in a browser (I use chrome). For example, I'm watching a video on YouTube or a stream on twitch or scrolling through reddit, I then click on any part of the page I'm currently using and the line appears as if I'm about to write something but I'm really not. I started noticing this recently out of the blue. I'm not sure I messed with anything so I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you!  My mom's computer was likely infected with malware, and all her data is in the cloud. Should I just reformat the computer and restore her files? What else should I be aware of? More info below. My parents called me to say they fell for a Norton Utilities phishing scam, the one where they send you an email about your upcoming subscription renewal and give you a number to call. My mom called, the gentleman on the phone was apparently very persuasive, she typed the exact letters he told her to type into google, a AC dialog box may or may not have appeared (she didn't remember when I asked), and the screen blanked and showed some sort of updating, do not shut down your message. At that point, a light bulb went off in my mom's head and she powered off the computer immediately. She also didn't fill out the google form the spammer sent asking for her name, address, date of birth, SN, etc. , although she could have mentioned any of these things over the phone. All her data is synced to OneDrive, all her passwords are synced to BitWarden, and she hasn't turned her computer back on. I'm thinking that, next time I visit, I should wipe her computer completely, sign her back in to OneDrive and BitWarden, and everything will be okay. But what else should I watch out for? I'm nervous that, behind the fake screen, they were stealing information. They could have gone to her websites and logged right in if her BitWarden vault was unlocked (although it was probably still locked. ) She also has sensitive medical and financial info on her computer and a word document with all her passwords in it. I hope this serves as a cautionary tale if nothing else. My parents aren't elderly, they're both fairly good with computers, and they both fell for this scam.  Hi this is the first time Ive posted but I really need help. I just got an amd 3rd gen cpu from a friend who said it worked but when I tried to turn it on nothing happened. I tried everything from a different hdi cable to a different motherboard but it still wont post. I have relatively good pc knowledge and I cant tell if I just dont understand how to put this pc together or if something is broken. My specs are . Afd 3rd gen cpu 6 core 12 threads . Nvidia rt 2060. 16 gb of ram. 550 watt psu . Asks prime x570-p mother board . Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Every time i turn on my computer it says boot device not found please install a operating system hard disk 3f0. I was in the middle of playing a game and then all of a sudden that popped up i tried switching to legacy in bios and a couple different things in bios none have worked i also went into system diagnostics and tested everything and it passed please help me.  I got a brand new computer just now, a pre-built because parts are still too expensive. Relevant parts:. Gigabyte B550 Gaming X TX Motherboard. Gigabyte TX 3080 Ti 12Gt Graphics Card. Monitor: AUS RG Px279Q. When I turn on the Px, the LEDs on the CPU cooler and fan / case turn on, fans spin. Fans on the PU do spin as well. There are no lights on the PU, but I'm not sure if there are any. The monitor is showing No error. I tried all 3 De ports on the card, with same results. I tried the port on the motherboard itself as well just in case it lets me at least see the IOS, but it also didn't work. The monitor and cable definitely work, I am using them before and after this test with my now old Px. I have contacted the seller and waiting for the response, but wondering if people here are able to help while I wait. What can I do to troubleshoot / fix the problem? . To preempt some suggestions:. I do not have an DMI cable to test that output, but I will get one tomorrow. I cannot move this card to my old system to test it because it only has a 550W SU and I don't want to somehow kill it (assuming it's not dead on arrival already). I also suspect the current set-up doesn't have 2 8-pin connectors that 3080 needs. I have not tried moving my current card (1080) into the new system as I'm not sure what that would accomplish. Thanks! . EDIT: I checked both AM sticks and they are securely installed and watched.  I've reinstalled the app several times but i doesn't fix the problem. Any help? .  For some reason, when I try to add a device to windows by using bluetooth, the window just crashes and doesn't even attempt to look for the device. Even when I try to use the icon at the bottom of the screen, the prompt a device to is greed out and will not let me click it whatsoever. Would anyone have any idea on how to fix this issue?  I'm trying to stream some of my lectures but when I hook up the capture card it says HDCP how can I fix this?  Hi,. While back I made a post with an issue I was having with Windows 11. The Auto Moderator replied to that post with some caution around upgrading. This caused a notification to appear in my notifications section of my I. While I was initially happy to receive the notification, I have since resolved that post. While I'm able to hide or remove other notifications from that section, there is no way either in my desktop browser or on mobile device to remove that notification. I like to remove notifications as I respond to them to keep that area clean and useful. Having a notification from the Auto Moderator four months ago is a real summer. I'm hoping there is a way to resolve this.  Hey all, I just installed a new cpu (i3-8100 - i7-9700) and my Px wont boot to Windows, but is able to boot to IOS. Any help? . Specs. - i7-9700F. - TX 1050. - Z370A Pro. - 16Gt 3000MHz Ram. - 3To Barracuda DD. Things I have tried. - Resetting IOS/MOS. - Checking connections. - Checking paste and cooler. - Checked multiple times the compatibility before and after purchase/installation. Other things to try. -Clean install of Windows. Description of what happens. On startup, the screen where one would press Del/F11 for entering your the IOS appears, but then it freezes when loading and the pc just sounds like its running fine otherwise. Now when I try to boot it, I BSD and get a WHA-Uncorrectable-Error.  I accidentally put my account in a family group a while back and recently it has gotten to be over 13, the age requirement to leave and delete family groups. The problem is that it has been saying that even though the age is over 13, I can't delete the family group or change my accounts age. I have tried using the parent device (which I also use) to change the age but it says that I need to be under 13 for that, therefore not letting me change it at all. Any solutions?  I was mid game when the power went out and when i restarted my pc i noticed the mouse wasnt glowing anymore and my monitors kept saying . This isn't a monitor issue though because they still work plugged in to my laptop. Same with the mouse. I also did switch the cables out for different HDMI, unplugged everything else, and reset a ton. My keyboard lights up still ? And when I unplug it from the back and try to plug the mouse in to check the port the mouse doesn't power up. So ? My SB ports are what? Fried? The inside doesn't look like anything is sucked up but I also may not be 100% sure what to look for. Basically, am I sucked and have to buy a new graphics card bc my monitors aren't picking anything up? I'm not sure how to go about this. Please and thank you.  I just bought a Pc from a friend and the Ethernet is not Working. The whole router shuts down when I plug in the Ethernet Cable. The ethernet Cable worked on my laptop, but when I plug it in the pc the router shuts down. Can anyone help me please!  Not sure if this is the right place to post this but steam is like a wii menu on my mac and games run really slow did i download a weird version or something.  i ve been having this weird problem for a while now, i tried everything , reinstalled windows, drivers checked the screen, messed around in power settings, but it still occurs ,not all the time but mostly when i leave the computer on screen time out for a long time, plus 15mins. laptop model: hp pavilion 15 403nf.  I know this is a very weird post but still.  This has been happening for 3 days now and I don't know why. Basically having the touchpad on when a mouse is option off () and having a mouse unplugged completely disable the touchpad. I even disconnected all things in the SB ports and nothing worked. The mousepad works completely fine with the setting on. My Windows is completely updated. How can I fix this?  Hey everyone,. As the title says, I recently put together a new build with the MD 5800x, Asks RG x570 TX, Samsung 980 SD, 16Gt of Corsair Vengeance LP, a Cooler Master V750 FX, and the Gigabyte 3060ti. In Windows, after installing nVidia drivers, the computer has severe lag and pitches/shutters, and goes to a black screen every 3-5 minutes, more notably after engaging the PU in some way (loading Chrome, starting Furmark, a game, etc). I booted a SB stick with Ubuntu on it, and noticed a similar pattern: When using the non-nVidia graphics drivers in Ubuntu, I had no issue. I ran CPU benchmarks in Ubuntu with no issue either. However, once enabling the nVidia proprietary drivers, I was getting the exact same issues, severe lag, pitches, freezes, crashes/black screens. I first tried Memtest86, showing no errors after 4 passes. Errors also do not occur during IOS, or while Memtest is loaded, so in situations where the nVidia PU is running in doing just basic software rendering of simple GUI, there seems to be no problems. I tried swapping AM sticks with another Px, no change. I tried a IOS update as well, and resetting IOS settings, and again, no change. I swapped and again, no change. Finally, swapping in an old nVidia 1060, the problem entirely cleared up. I ran Asks RealBench for 3 hours, and noticed no issues whatsoever. Is the PU bad, or is there another potential remedy to this that I might not have tried? It was purchased from a (seemingly decent and honest) guy on Craigslist, who purchased it originally only a few months prior, and came with original packaging. I was going to try a MOS reset, but I've read with these Asks x570 boards, that requires unplugging the motherboard's battery, which is absolutely buried underneath a bunch of metal crap, so I've been reluctant to try that. Of course I realize, it being Craigslist, that I might have been sold a crap PU, but I'm hoping to ask here for any things to try before going through the difficult process of trying to get my money back on a Craigslist exchange, or trying to send it in for MA. The one thing on my to-do list is to try swapping the 3060ti into an old Px and seeing if the problems follow the PU to the old Px. I'll edit with an update once I do. Thanks all!  .

Hello all, Im trying to go passwordless with my Pos and have physical-keys tied to my login, with all of the cybersecurity incidents lately. I cant seem to find any reliable info that works on this topic (which is odd because physical keys seem genius). I have two Yubikey 5 NFC and supposedly they work in this application. Ive also downloaded the yubico windows login software from their website. When I download it on any of my machines, it creates a Yubico login on my machine that accepts my username and password. I log in and start the configuration software. No matter what machine I try this on and no matter if I try it from the Yubico account or my own account, it will not recognize any of the users on my machine. When I get to the select users screen, its just a blank page, with no users to select. Because I cant select a user, I cant set up my key to work with the Yubikey. Ive tried the netplwiz command to see if I could find anything of value about my account or to unlock it for discovery, but no dice on that either . Does anyone know how to get that to work, or know of a better software thats easier to set up? . Thanks!  Whenever I listen to audio through headphones connected via jack I hear a loud distorted static sound, the same sound is heard when I with the microphone. Today they both suddenly worked and now are once again not working. It has been like this for like 4 months and no one on the internet seems to know the answer,.  Hello all,. I just installed a friends monitor, however the cable is to short and does not quite reach where they wanted it. The power connector is very thin - its not a traditional power cord you'd use to power on a Px and the like. What is the actual name for this? I want to buy an extended for it- but i'm not sure what the connector is called. Thank you!  A friend of mine installed a program on my Px and since then it started acting Windows 10 is laggy and quite unresponsive. I tried scanning my Px with Norton 360 (the antivirus I own) but it does not detect anything. The file is named and I found it inside the program's directory. I also tried checking it with T but is returns me an error of some sort.  Ive been looking into repurposing my old kindly fire 3rd gen. Into a show style device, but everything Ive found is for newer devices. Is there anything cool I can do for this old ass piece of tech?  The wifi bill is played but it isnt working, there are three cords in my box, two white ones and a black one. I was thinking maybe if I unplugged something then just plugged it back in after a minute or so maybe it would be fixed. Could I try this or would it mess with my wifi even more, if there is a certain one I can unplug or ones I can't please tell.  Hi. I mainly play games like Warthunder and Roblox. About a week ago my Px did something odd. I was in the middle of a game when both of my monitors completely blocked out, turned themselves back on, and repeated the process for 3-4 times over the course of a minute. After this, both monitors completely shut off. I turned on my main monitor and the two programs I had open at the time were tripled. I had 3 Warthunder tabs open and 3 chrome tabs open. Before the black flashes I only had 1 of each. My first instinct was to shutoff/restart the Px, which I did. After I did so, i turned the Px back on my second monitor wasn't working (I already fixed that issue, just a bad DMI cord) But the main issue is the fact that I cant run any games. A very non-graphic intensive game like Roblox runs at 1-2 fps. Whenever I open Warthunder it says: Video mode initialization error. Error initializing video, Microsoft basic render is not supported. I no longer can run any games and I am scared I have damaged my PU. Please help. Note: I am very careful with what I download. I don't just click everything I see with a bright red download button.

My Px sometimes decides it will only sporadically connect to certain website/domains. Today, I stopped being able to reliably access the domain Duolingo uses to submit lessons, which is not particularly useful. Other parts of Duo still work, and submitting lessons sometimes works. I did not edit any settings between yesterday and today to trigger this. Troubleshooting: Have tried clearing nothing. Tried changing browser from Firefox to same issue. Tried resetting no change. Tried resetting no change. Tried turning on no change. Tried flushing no change. Tried using a different computer in the works perfectly, so it's local. Looking at my network traffic while it tried to unsuccessfully submit a lesson it hits a BLOCKED status with Ns_BINDING_ABORTED under Transferred. Following this it alternated between OST messages - 200 success - to excess. duolingo. com, UT messages to www. duolingo. com with a blank status, and ET message from br. duolingo. com which result in 404s. A helpful user suggested changing NS server. I changed to which worked. For about a day. Then it stopped. So I changed to Quad9, which worked for a few hours, then had one extremely laggy submission, then stopped working. Then Cloudserve, which did the same as Quad9. So, once again I have no idea what the issue is when switching NS temporarily fixes it?  So for past few months I have been facing this problem:. My Px randomly freezes and then crashes and reboot itself. I have done stress test for Ram , PU and CPU and couldn't find any errors. Even formatted my Px and replaced thermal paste.

I am able to run rocket league fine with my mediocre graphics card with 8Gt of ram. He has a much better graphics card, I wanna say its a NVIDIA FORCE 3060 and he also has 8Gt of AM. his game loads up but tags and freezes even in free play or just at the Home Screen. He has the game setting matched up with his monitor and computer settings and nothing we try to do works. any advise?  I search for benchmarks on exact specs and somehow they get more frames by a lot,i tried everything ,its not any kind of bottleneck,i dont think i need any drivers,the 3060 ti oem is 2 fans by the way and the airflow in the case is pretty trash,i get about max since its locked on full load.  A user of ours has a new Alienware laptop. When the computer is setup just like a laptop, everything works fine after reboot. Meaning speakers play sound. As soon as he hooks up two monitors via hdi and all peripherals, the speakers actually stop work and remove themselves from control panel/sound.

I have a Px and my phone connected to the same wifi with no issues. I have googled the problem and went through the suggested steps like turning off background updates, resetting network settings multiple times, restarting the router and modem countless times, new modem (suggested by my SP), checking for driver updates, turning off startup programs, moving the laptop right next to the router, and some others. This happens off and on, and sometimes it works with no issues. It seems to happen more often on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I don't know if that's relevant.

I am having trouble to detach the fan blades from my Sapphire X 570 4Gt TX so I can get a deeper clean on them, the screw is literally unaccesable. Should I remove them be pressure? .

The job is sending me equipment 2 monitors a hard drive keyboard and mouse. Roommate is using TT router. Any advice on how to add internet for work? . p. s - not really tech savvy. But I can physically set up the desktop.  not sure if this is an issue or if its easily fixed or what. Recently bought a rebuilt and sent in a support ticket but wanted to know if there was anything that may be causing this. Manually setting the fans to high speeds proves the fan works but it constantly turns on and off when at low speeds.  So Im trying to fix some corrupted system files. I ran the sfc /scannow command in the command prompt and when it finished I received the following message: Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.

Hi All so i got a question i got a free mainborad ram cpu combo from a friend. He told me that he wasnt able to mount the cpu cooler and that some pins were missing on the cpu and that i could have it for free. I checked the cpu multiple times and all pins are still on the cpu i also managed to mount the cooler however when i try to start it only the fan spins up and nothing else happens. I Tried to connect a low power gefroce 8400Gt for video output but no dice the Au also doesn't output any video. I tried both of the ram slots but nothing changed i also tried booking it without the ram in it if it would do any been post codes but it never keeps with or without the ram. I think that the board is probably dead i have build multiple systems but never an amd system before. I dont really know if the mainboard has a keeper installed or if it maybe needs an bios update to support the cpu. I know that the mainboard has one of those Asks orange led strips but it never lights up even when the fans spin up. The Mainboard has a few light scratches on the back but they are so light that it shouldn t keep it from booking. Specs:. Asks A68He-Plus. Afd A8 7600 4Core 4Threads. DR3 8Gt 1333MHz. Gefroce 8400Gt.

I dont really have a use for this system however some of my friends literally never had a pc and they wanted to get one but due to the current prices they weren't able to so i wanted to get it running and give it to one of my friends (With a decent gpu it should at least run Cs Go). I know that one of my friends bought a mini it amd board but wasn t able to get a cpu and gpu so maybe i could give him the cpu but i dont know if it would fit in his board because i know almost nothing about amd sockets.  :.

Hello, my computer has recently begun restarting at random times. There is often no error message involved when this happens (on start up) just a kernel power error 41 in event viewer. I believe it has something to do with my bios, CPU or SU as I tested my AM and it was fine. However, I recently changed my CPU voltage to 1. 25V rather than auto which was sitting around 1. 4V and it seems my computer has not restarted since. My CPU is an MD ryzen 5 5600x and I read online 1. 3V and auto should be fine. I was hoping someone could have input on why I had to manually set my CPU voltage lower to get stability in my system. All IOS options should be stock and there is no overclocking done. Thank you.  I'm trying to do some penetration testing on a website of mine using command prompt with the script: -t (ip address) -l I'm getting nothing but the message timed Is it working? Am I doing something wrong?  I need to get my He Officejet 7410 printer to work with wifi. My wifi WP password has 10 chars in it and the printer wants 9 only. If it is 10 it wants hex. How do I enter Risingsun! as hex in this printer?  I'm at my sisters apartment and for some reason when I connect my phone to the wifi, after a few minutes everything on the network stops working and I have to reset the router. But when I don't connect my phone, no issue. Any ideas why that is? It seems like it's just me because her boyfriend comes over and connects his phone, tablet, and ps4 with 0 issues.  So, for almost a two years now, I've been having issues with my DEL PS 15 9500. They come and go, I never know what fixes it, but the principle is basically the same. Games run at 30-40% PU utilization, and often run below 60fps at lowest settings. Every PU benchmark I ran used 100% PU and showed respectable results for my PU model. But game performance is poor compared to the benchmarks of other people with the same system. I have tried switching power plans both within the Dell Power manager and windows, reinstalled windows completely several times, updated drivers, tweaked Nvidia control panel and did a few other things to no success. As I mentioned above, this behavior comes and goes every few months. Before theissue came back a week ago, my laptop ran pretty well for a few months, with occasional shut offs during games and some problem where I would have to restart the computer a couple of times before it recognized being plugged into the charger. It feels like I tried almost everything and I am really considering just buying a new machine. What could cause this strange behavior? What could be the reason for poor PU utilization only in games? . Thanks!

I just downgraded my TX 1060 6Gt to my TX 770 2Gt (I was only borrowing the 1060, long story). After installing the 770, I plug everything in, but the monitor says when I boot my Px up. Everything else seems fine: the Px sounds good, all the parts are running, the fans on the video card are spinning, and the video card is getting warm. The 770 has been in a box for about a year, but it hasn't really been touched or moved since then. It was working perfectly when I originally removed it from my Px. I tried two different monitors, reinstalling the 770 (taking it out and starting over), plugging all the cords in and out. Does anyone have any suggestions? Please, I'm at a loss. My Px specs are:.

I have an Acre Aspire XC-1660 and I wanted to add an additional SD to it, but I'm a not sure how do the wiring for this Px. Since there are no accessible power cables from the SU, I suppose I have to get the power from the motherboard, but I'm not sure where to connect the power cable for the drive.

As you can see, the CPU usage curve is up and down like a yoo with about 5-15 seconds between peaks and trough. This happens with any program, including CPU-Z and a custom program I made which counts to a billion+ flat out. What could be causing this? Checked bios and a reset didn't help. Obviously I set the minimum and maximum processes state to 100% in the Windows Power Plan settings. On my other two Pos, the CPU graph is flatline, it stays at the peak of the roller coaster, and doesn't dip down.  My computers Bluetooth isnt working at all, I go to connect a new device and it instantly says Couldn find device. I have also completely reinstalled it and everything and the problem is still appearing. When I go check the drivers its disappearing and reappearing over and over.  I have been trying to use the creation tool to fix an issue where updates fail and it is not working. It will get to the point of going to restart the computer before giving a 10 installation has message with no code. This should be a link with the logs for helping figure this out. Let me know if it didn't work right.  So i recently broke my monitor and had to use a new one, which is actually just a tv, i made a custom resolution for it that would make it run at 75hz as i knew it was capable of it, but some games as valorant and cso just reset it to the resolution of my old monitor, which isnt really the best as it cuts stuff off, but for example i tried Su too and forcing into native resolution made it work perfectly fine, ive tried deleting the local settings files of both valorant and cs but even though in game both games look fine it rests the resolution as soon as i quit and locks onto it until i reset my computer, does anyone know a solution for this? This is on a x 1650 ddr6 on the newest game ready drivers if it matters.  Hey everyone! So a bit of background: I got airpod pros in august 2020 and they progressively got worse (noise cancellation not working, cracking/static sounds). I found out that all AirPods sold before October 2020 may be apart of a recall. Im a college student and was home for spring break last week, so I went to an apple store to have mine evaluated to see if they be apart of the recall. Sure enough, both of my AirPods failed the test they put them through and they gave me a new replacement pair for free (just the individual AirPods, not the case). I used them that night and they worked great. I was completely blown away by the difference. I hadn realized how bad my old ones had gotten. Anyway, today I put them in again for the second time and the right one wont connect or respond to anything I do. I tried resetting them, re-pairing them, etc and nothing is working. Im wondering if anyone knows what to do. The warranty on my broken pair that I turned in was expired, but would they give me a new replacement for this one since it literally stopped working out of nowhere? I also didnt drop them, water damage them, or anything like that so Im not sure why its not working.  Hi all,. I would like to clean install Office 365. No traces to anything Office related, so I can set it up from scratch. Anyone any other tips in order to remove it completely?  Hi all,. Thanks for clicking on this, my Huawei Bluetooth hs is not working quite right. I fully charge them, over night, and the battery is gone in 2 hours or less, than I recharge them same thing happens. I thought they were dead, but than suddenly sometimes the battery do lasts for 16 hours lol, so they are not dead I tried using a different charger but that did nothing to the problem, I don't get it why does the battery last sometimes but most of the times only for 2 hours or less? :(.  I've had my headset and my pc for awhile and never had an issue with it up till now. My audio(output) works fine but my microphone(input) is having issues . The problem goes like this. I'll be talking in a voice chat, mostly during raids or social events when my voice supposedly starts getting quieter and quieter until it can't be heard anymore and then no response to apps or programs what so ever. I've tested the headset with multiple devices and I haven't had this issue, and when doing testing in my settings I've found that my voice is still picked up but at very small amounts. This issue can be fixed by leaving and re-entering a voice call, but it happens again shortly after rejoining making it a constant battle to make sure my mic is being picked up. This issue is very odd to me and I don't have any idea what might be causing it.  I think someone is reporting my nodes without my consent. does anyone have a tool for reverse image search that is better than or a better way to do it? thanks!  So on my He pavilion laptop usually when I turn it on it will show me a picture in the background and where and what that picture is and then if I swine down I can enter my password,but now its just a picture and my mouse and I cant do anything. (my laptop is not touch screen).  powershell running in the background , closes after som time when task manager is opened. Fresh Installed Win 11 2 Days ago, I hav python but i uninstalled it still it pops up in my taskmanager with this powershell. is this something i hav to worry about ?  Is it normal to have this kind of graph in gpu-z while gaming ? I don't know if it is related or not but i'm getting regular fps drops in every game i play no matter what settings i apply to that specific game. My current rig is :. Intel i7 11700k. TX 3060 ti AUS DAL MIN 8 Gt. 16 Gt of DR4 3000 mhz (amp turned on in IOS). AUS PRIME Z590-P. 750W SU OLD from cooler master. Games and Of installed on a m. 2 ssd.  Hello,. Need some help here. Whenever I fire up a game, I get random crashes. The timing varies from one game to another. Cyberpunk 2077 would crash within 5 minutes of load, Far Cry 6 about half an hour. Rocket League sometimes works for hours, sometimes crashes after an hour and a half. Every time the frame freezes, the music goes on and eventually, crash to desktop. Recently, however, I've started getting BSODs with the error mentioned in the post title. The funny thing is, while the game runs, it runs perfectly fine. There is no artifacting, no random freeze and plays (except before crash) and no shutters to speak of. it's all smooth sailing until the ship drowns suddenly (metaphorically speaking). I haven't changed much. Recently got a Colorful TX 3070, swapping out my old TX 2060. The thing is, the crashes used to take place on the 2060 as well, but never got this weird BSD before. I've stress tested the PU with Furmark for about 20 minutes at a stretch. Steady temps of 69-70 degrees. Cinebench works perfectly. PU Stability test was completed up to 37 minutes, no issues whatsoever. Oh, and I installed Windows 11 about a month ago. These errors have increased substantially since the new Of was installed. Any help would be appreciated. Edit : Dump files uploaded here -.  Hello,. Any with Xbox Elite series 2 and Px can show me the interface of Steam to Map the controller, I want to see if Steam allow to map 4 back paddle of the control. Thanks.  So basically, I am either doing something on my pc(games,videos,editing) then my pc just completely boots off without warning and then almost immediately boots right back up. I have swapped out the ram still shutting off. Changed gpu. Added extra fan(in case of overheating). Changed drives. I suspect it is a cheap power supply that keeps sorting out or something.  When I turned on my laptop today it seemed fine, then I logged into my windows account, after that the screen turned dark so I turned off my computer and tried turning it back on, this time the screen lit up but stated black. I tried again, the screen didn't even light up. I tried removing the battery and A and tried removing the residual electricity and it didn't work, so now I'm kinda outta ideas.  I had bought a Hyper keyboard and like 3 months after I got it, the paint started to chip keyboard btw). Since Hyper won't replace it despite no user mishap, what can I do to fix it? The problem is in the keyboard's backplate as shown in the images. I was thinking of wrapping the sides in vynil. Maybe I could disassembled it so I can sand the rest of the paint off, but it sounds like a lot of work.  . A bit hard to show, but looks a lot worse on phone than on computer I see - my front facing camera on samsung note 10 turns my face yellow. First photo shows the yellowish tint, second photo I turned away and it didn't turn yellow (you can even see it at the very bottom of my sideburn in my hair. It cuts off around my jaw before my neck starts). I can see it happening as well. When I take a photo, if I click on it very quickly I see the original colour - it then into a more yellowish hue, only on the face. It doesn't do it for other parts of the body. There are no filters, beauty mode is off, and I have updated the phone and photo settings. I think this is just. a part of the phones internal camera settings? . Does anyone have any idea?  When I open Google it's fine and it let's me search and let's me do stuff but if I try to go to websites it doesn't work same with all my other apps and games please help.  when i go in my appdata, local, then google, there's this folder called and i'm not sure if it should be there. it seems out of place, like a virus or something like that, but i'm scared that it might break something.  Hey everyone. The Google widget i use used to show the news feed for the day. Now, however, it is showing my search history instead. I dont change any settings or change anything so I am stamped as to why this is happening. Can someone help me get my news feed back? ITA.  I live in the north west and my internet speed has always been great. It's a part of our town government to provide great internet for a fee. Details on that on request. Suffice to say I am fluctuating from 999maps download and upload to 79maps download/upload. This guy I had come over is like 50y/o+ and admits during our conversation that he liked to mess with computer code, that he was a nerd back when the internet was in its fetal state. I was helping him apply for jobs. He pauses for a moment to open my command prompt without asking and messes with it for about a total of three minutes while I watch him. I didn't understand any of it. All the while summing and having about my speed and that I must have a lot of going on. My knowledge of this stuff is rough at best. All I know is that I'm running speed tests that are dramatically different. Here is an imgur link to some of my speed tests. Fluctuating speeds. Is it possible for someone to hijack my connection for example from the command prompt? Or do I need to be looking closer to home?  Recently my Astro A10 headphones mic has stopped working with my gaming Px. I am using a splitter for my Px so the cable from the headphones is split into a mic and a sound jack on the top of the computer. Slugging in some cheap in ear headphones I have into the gaming Px through the splitter the microphone can be detected and works no issues. I have reinstalled the Microphone(Realtek(R)Audio) driver as well as the Realtek(R) Audio driver separately to no avail. Under the sound menu in control panel the Astros a10s are not shown as a disabled device under the recording tab. Its looking like the microphone has busted in the headphones themselves but would like to confirm. Slugging the headphones into another laptop I have it doesnt seem to be using the microphone on the headset. Any advice would be great thanks in advance!  I have a Samsung A70.

I opened my phone today and found that both the downloads and documents folders have been completely wiped. Empty. No one else can physically access my phone but me. I recently downloaded Malwarebytes mobile app but no automatic functionality is enabled.

I have a SB signaling device--basically, a game show buzzer with a single button--that I'd like to use to play online trivia on my MacBook Pro. I bought it used off Bay and it didn't come with a manual or any documentation. It connects (via the SB hub) and works, but the issue is that computer interprets the button press as a and the game I'd like to use it for uses the space bar to activate the buzzer. So I'm trying to figure out how to change the device's output (or the interpretation of it by my computer) from to . I've tried using the Keyboard setup in preferences, but it doesn't recognize the keyboard type so I can't do anything there. I also installed SB Overdrive to try to control it that way, but I couldn't get that to work either--presumably the device is being controlled by another driver, but I couldn't figure out which one(s) in the drivers folders (/Library/Extensions and /System/Library/Extensions) to delete.

Hello guys . Half year ago I bought new laptop and around month ago it starting doing weird noise like resonating of fans . I'm too scared to open it cup I have guarantee. What should I do.  My taskbar isn't showing it just looks like that and Id how to fix it.  Hey everyone,. I'm using a laptop for Uni and anytime I press the power button, it'll boot up for sometimes a second, sometimes 5 seconds and completely shut off, despite the battery being fully charged. I have even tested it by removing the battery, plugging it into a wall socket and tested the power that way, but it does the same thing. I tried the novo pin on the side, it boots into the IOS menu, but shuts off after 3-5 seconds. At first I thought it was maybe the battery or adapter, but I even bought new ones despite even disconnecting the old battery and trying the method of using the charger only. I checked all the wires and cables, and they're all in place securely, and the laptop isn't dirty on the inside. Is there anything that may fix this issue, or is the laptop completely flatlined? Thank you :).  . I don't know how to attach videos to show you guys but I have been experiencing this issue for about a month and a bit now, some backstory to this issue. I was experiencing some trouble with a game, PS wise. ( The issue being on the games end not mine). At the time I didn't know this, therefore I looked up a few fixes for the issue. Some of them included clearing the dirextX cache via disk clean up, other were updating Nvidia Graphics card drivers and the last one i did was deleting all the contents in the DXcache in Nvidia file. I first cleared DirectX cache via disk clean up and performed a Nvidia card driver update and then I cleared the DXcache. This is when I first encountered the weird artefact for a split second. However, after the initial split artifact no other problems, issues or artifacts appear. My PU temps are normal both Idle and underload, my PS and performance in games is normal. Also it only appears on my main monitor and not my second monitor. I looked up the cause of this issue online and people were saying various issues, like failing hardware, bad drivers. I performed a DD and it didn't fix the issue, also I have a 3070 OC edition but I haven't done any overclocks myself to it. Any advice would be greatly apricated. I have a 3070 . 16 Gt . MD 3600 . B550 Game a Pro . Corsair M 750W Gold 80+.  my usb had has decided to stop working on windows. I use lightroom and have it access it as its where all my media files are but ive found the go pro folder is corrupt so lightroom will crash on opening. Windows explorer will crash if i have the usb had connected (to any port). If I plug had into my mac i can access the folders and files fine including in the corrupt go pro folder but its a nts formatted had so the mac cant delete anything. I thought I could just delete the go pro folder in cmd but it hangs. I tried chkdsk in windows and through cmd line both just hang. Do i have any option other than to format the partition? . I was looking to see if there was a linux boot usb boot disc tool i could use to get access to be able to delete the folder?  So, I've recently got a tablet for work and naturally have been looking for ways to use it for my personal time as well, now what I'm wondering is if it is possible to use my tablet kinda like a second (or in my case third) monitor, but still get the sound over my computer, I've tried using Bluetooth but they although they paired up can't actually connect to each other. Some help would be appreciated. Edit: It's an Galaxy tab a8 und my Of is Windows.  My Px used to connect to my ACE monitor for about a month, recently I reset it and now It will not connect to any monitor. Ive tried using 3 different types brands, one ACE and one DEL, both will only connect for a short time, this is only a recent issue as it happened yesterday. The Px worked fine with the ACE before, the oldest thing is that If I connect it from a To to the monitor it will initially boot on the monitor but I have to unplug it to get it to my office. The monitor will work with other devices like my switch but not the Px. Any Ideas? . List of failed things to try: . Resetting MOS. Resetting AM sticks. NEW DMI CORDS. rebooting and replugging in cables.  This is a little tricky. The problem happens with a comp I am running into an Epson projector. There's a splitter in the line, one output going to the Epson, the other to a flat screen. This used to work fine using the DMI output from a Gigabyte board with a Radeon chip. But now using an Intel board and the 1080ti it requires a reboot. I'm stamped. I've tried supplying 5v to the Techole splitter -- didn't need to do that with the Gigabyte setup -- but no go. I got a regular monitor to check without using the splitter. The comp actually boots fine. So it's just a problem with the hdi feed from the 1080ti being different in some way from that coming out of the other comp with the Radeon chip, the splitter somehow creates a problem. Thanks for your advice.  I have MA'd a laptop and when it came back the screen won't work.

I work at a print shop, and we get lots of flash drives from customers containing the files they want to print, edit. Since those are all foreign devices it was not wise to plug them directly into any of our main computers someone came up with this solution:. 1. plug customer's SB unto a computer with no network access call it //burnerPC), select the file the customer indicates and run a file scan with an antivirus. 2. Should no threats be found this file is then copied to another (clean) SB drive which can then be plugged into our computers (//mainPC). I've been wondering for a while whether this system could be streamlined or improved in any way. I thou about shaping //burnerPC to a linux distro, but most of my colleagues aren't tech savvy enough to use it.  Hey there. I was wondering if anyone knows.

Well, this laptop is old (Dell Inspiron 15r, bought in 2014) but it's worth saving. Now, I know the basics of computers, and know that i can replace the hard drive myself, but i don't know some things, like:. 1. What kind of drive should i buy? I mean, are drives for laptops and desktop the same? . 2. I guess that only some kind of drives can match this exact model? . 3. Can I really install a drive without killing the laptop as a whole? . Thanks in advance!  Hi,. Just had a quick question. Was recently troubleshooting some performance issues with my Px (which are mostly sorted out currently). This included restoring my IOS settings back to default and updating to newest IOS. I never tried clearing MOS during this process and was wondering if it was necessary and whether clearing MOS has any additional benefit versus pressing optimized on an AUS motherboard (Z370-P). Trying to learn more about what clearing MOS actually does, and how it is different than just loading IOS to default. Thanks.  So I've had the N200+ 5G for a few months now and I'm still running into the same occurring problems. 1) my apps won't update and new apps won't install.

I have tried everything even called my phone provider to see if I could get it fixed and they couldn't do anything. Any and all help that gets these problems fixed is seriously needed and appreciated.  Hi! So recently, Ive been getting this pop up with every boot on my laptop.

Hello! . I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming. Over the years, I've changed components, but I am a novice. What I've recently learned about is stripped screws, as I damaged one of the internal screws when attempting to replace a component. Luckily, I was able to get a professional to remove it. What I can now see is that the screw on what Dell calls the (the final cover you put back on the laptop) is showing signs of being stripped. I would like to replace it before it become fully stripped, and not possible to remove without involving a professional again. However, I face two problems:. It is a captive screw (the type where it stays on the back cover when it is unscrewed). How do I replace that? . The screw list does not list what type of screw it is. The last bullet point makes me question whether this is even possible, but I'd like to know for sure. Thanks! . Support manual for Laptop:.

Can anyone help me with my problem? . Im on Reddit mobile and the post is the r/raspberry_pi subreddit. Let me know if you need anything else from me.  Hi, my dad uses laptop to watch DVD movies, but after specific disc laptop suddenly got stuck on one specific screen. There is option to log out of it, but it doesn't work. We tried to restart laptop, but that didn't changed anything. Any idea s what that could be?  Title says it all. Deposited some money into my account via TM. I went to go look at it on my mobile app and its gone. Went into App Store (iPhone) to download it, and it gives you the close download icon. Doesn download though. Things I did: searched the phone for it through search. Called tech support to ask if app was taken down or discontinued . Restarted. Im at a loss? I use it to deposit checks regularly, so this is a necessity for me. Thanks. Edit: App is called Union Bank - Mobile Banking.  Is this any type of mac address? Can anyone tell me what kind of In this is?  For some reason, after coming off FIFA for an hour, I opened Opera Gt and an image of Canada with arrows pointing into the Up appeared as my background. Immediately realizing it must have been downloaded onto Files, I checked downloads and it appeared on Downloads. It appeared that I downloaded it at 17:20, which was when I was on my Px watching YouTube just before opening FIFA. I would like some help as to how this could have happened, as I was on my Px at the time. I have done a virus scan and nothing has come back. And as far as I am aware, Viruses don't change backgrounds for no reason and then do nothing else.  So I recently restarted my computer and spotted some pretty obvious vertical white lines on the monitor, after trying a few things such as reconnecting cables and booking in safe mode I believe the lines are gone, but I sometimes think they might just be really faded and was wondering if anyone knew of a tool that could help me spot them because the best I got right now is sliding my discord window over the screen. I know it may seem silly to worry about since the problem might be fixed, but if there's a more definitive way to test, I'd like to deal with it now, rather than waiting for this to pop up again.  Currently using POC X3 Pro. I cannot find or see some of my photos in my Private album (both local and in the mi cloud) however it is still in my . secretalbum folder (as . S file). The files is around 900 (. S) while in the private album it only shows 300+. Can you still recover those . S files?  Hello There. I recently uninstalled all the bloatware and default apps on my windows 11 pc. Im glad all that candy crush, xbox game bar stuff is gone but now im missing the actually essential windows stuff like wordpad, shipping tool etc. Do you know any way to install only the windows default apps that arent bloatware and over the top unnecessary? I have been trying to google this for the past 40 minutes but that problem seems to be way too niche. I would be so thankful if any of you capable people out there could help me out here. TLDR: need a way to install only the actually essential default apps on windows. Is there a PowerShell script for that? pls help. Thanks.  I need a speaker with really low maximum sound for my mentally handicapped relative staying with me. He likes to put everything at max volume.

As one of the most tech-savvy (read: young) people working for my nonprofit, I often get tasked with internet related issues, and this one is beyond my general it off and back on level of knowledge. So here's what I'm dealing with and why I'm reaching out to the wider community: . We are currently running a mesh router system (Euro) due to the size of the main office building and multiple buildings on the property we've recently acquired. Our internet provider is Litewire, which came highly recommended to us by the previous owner of the property. The problem lies here however: Our internet will cut out for five to ten seconds at a time, making things like the obligatory zoom meetings all but impossible to manage. I think I got in the course of an hour long meeting today around twenty times. The feed just cuts out and people can't hear me. When I spoke to Litewire, they came out, adjusted a few things, and emailed the following: . avoid interfering with the connection to our tower, the 5gh wifi channel on the customer's router should be set to channel 36 (5180mhz/5. 18gh). It looks like the customer has an Euro mesh wifi system, and as far as I know, those don't give you the ability to manually set the wifi channel, so there's no way to prevent it from (Read: Sucks to suck, bro). So in my brain, I'm thinking, I can just order a new mesh router but, NOPE. None of the ones I can find for a reasonable price (again, working for a nonprofit here) will let you manually set the wifi channel. I called Euro tech support and they said that they also can't change the wifi channel, but recommended I try using it in Well, that was even worse, with the added suck of our printer not being able to connect to the wifi when it's in that mode. What are my next steps, Reddit? Should I look at a different SP? Is there a mesh wifi system I haven't found that allows channel-changing? I could potentially set up a non-mesh wifi system, but I'm thinking that might require some shenanigans to get service all through this 3 story office barn. Please let me know if there's a subreddit better suited to answer this question, but y'all were the first place I thought of. Thanks!  For example, if i try to use the color white, It shows yellow. When I use purple, it shows red, and when I use blue, it shuts off. Everything else in the mouse works perfectly fine. Racer support is extremely unhelpful and wouldnt even offer me a replacement. Ive reset my Px, The software, and the mouse itself but nothing seems to change :/.  Whenever I try to download an app, I press the get button. But it loads for about 10 seconds then nothing happens and the button appears as get again. Im currently sat at home on full bars of Wiki, so connection isnt an issue. Any help would be appreciated.  I have an old 3G phone without a sim card. Can I just connect to the internet with wifi?  I have this older Planar monitor working off the div output of a GeForce card. Lately, it has begun randomly flickering annoyingly. Most of the time a simple tap or two on the top will cure the flicker for a while. I have checked the connections and they are tight. What else might be wrong?  In January I put together a new Px build, borrowing my old SU and PU. Everything else is new. While I had a few issues getting it to boot in the first place, I eventually got it going (something was not plugged in). First time I booted it up I got a big smell out of it, plastic and chemically. I didn't think much of it because I know new components can smell. It did get better over time. However it never went away fully. I figured it should have dissipated by the start of March so I gave the Px a good smell test and cleaning. I spelled the SU, nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the PU. The only place I got a big smell from was the exhaust fan at the back of the case. It spelled heavily of that same smell. A closing plastic/chemical smell and it has a bitter feel to the air quality. Since I couldn't find it anywhere else I figured that must be the culprit. I took that out and got a new Noctua fan to replace it. The smell is better, but definitely still this though. I don't smell it as heavily from the rear of the case anymore and I can't seem to pinpoint where it'd be coming from. It changes the air quality slightly in that small room and has a slightly bitter taste in the air. My wife says she can't smell it but I know it's there. Should I wait longer to see if it fully goes away? Is there anything else I can try? . This is my build: . Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention. I had huge trouble getting the 24 pin power cable into the motherboard. Way too much pressure to put it in. Nothing was bent or anything though. Other power cables fit in it fine and the cable that gave me trouble went into my old B just fine. I got a Lian Li Strummer extension to bridge the two together and that worked fine. Edit: Temps are perfect, PU never goes above 69. CPU in Cinebench never went above 86 (very normal for this CPU). With Undervolting it never went above 72 in Cinebench.  So I was just opening tabs in Opera when my computer just randomly shuts off. There has been no such problems prior to this. Windows event viewer had this to say (it gave 2 of these errors back to back) (translated from Finnish):. There has been a major hardware error. Part that made the report: processor core. Error source: Machine Check Exception. Error type: Cache Hierarchy Error. Processor API identifier: 0. There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary going on after the restart. Task manager looks normal and temps are normal as far as I know (Mojo, CPU and PU are all at around 50 C). So what is going on? Is it something serious, will it recur and if so, how do I fix it? If you need more information, I'll gladly give it if I'm told where to find it.  Got a new motherboard. Put everything up, checked all the cables. Cant figure out why its not turning on. Plugged the cpu cable from battery to cpu power port on mb. Pics below.  Does iphone 8 work with PA2-PS? I did some research and found that it doesnt really work with old devices but does iphone 8 count as an old device?  So I installed Live2D and it wouldn't opened, at first I assumed It was a problem with the actual program so I installed it on my laptop to check if any files had any changes or any codes was messed up. No problems at all, everything was as it should be. I noticed that on my laptop the program would open just fine, as well as the command prompts that came with the program but on my pc the command prompts instantly shut after being opened without even a second to look at it. Anyone know what's causing this and how to fix it?  I recently built my first gaming pc but I've been having the problem of my pc crashing after I play high intensity games for a while. I'm not sure exactly what causes it or how to fix it. when it crashes i get no blue screen, and instead both my monitors turn off. My best guess is that its my graphics card (Radeon X Vega 64 Air Boost), as it had been sitting without its box in storage for around a year. also that's what my monitors are connected too. I don't think that it's thermal throttling, though it would explain why my pc only crashes after playing for awhile. The reason I don't think its that is because my PU only every gets to 60C even on full load (thanks air boost). I have updated my drivers multiple times, and even updated my bios. nothing seems to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated and would help in whether I should just sell it and buy a new PU, or if there's a way to fix the crashing. Here's a specs list:. CPU: Ryzen 5 3600. Motherboard: ASRock B450M Pro4. Memory: PG Z1 DR4 3000Mh 32Gt. Graphics Card: Radeon Rx Vega64 AirBoost. Power Supply: aresgame GK850. Storage: Crucial T1000P2 2To SD . Dump files: .  Can I have an exhaust fan at bottom back of case by gpu and an intake on back near top of case for an bio.  I dual booted Windows 11 and Linux Monaro. now if I go to msconfig for some settings, it doesn't show Monaro option. How can I fix that?  Hello. I am in an extremely desperate situation and need help. My laptop has been on a slow decline for the past few months but everything went downhill yesterday and it's in quite the state. The left side has come undone and it keeps forming white spots which makes the cursor hang. I tried using office clips and that worked for some time until it cracked the screen further. Is there a temporary solution for this as I am unable to purchase a new one.  Hello, Sorry for my poor English. I had this phone (Samsung A30) for over 3 years and i love it, everything works great. Yesterday something hit it while it was in my pocket and the display went black but, the touch was working. I was navigating through it because i was familiar with the navigation. I went to the shop today and they changed the screen. it was working fine until i noticed some things are not working properly. 1. The touch is not very responsive. i have to click a little bit harder than usual. Even though the screen sensitivity is enabled. 2. While the screen is off and when i receive a notification, the notification pops up on the top of the screen as usual. But when the notification finishes/disappears my phone flashes white for a split second. I've used to check the red, green, blue, black colors and the touch it all works. What do you think the problem is? Did they install a bad or fake Samsung screen? . Or did the person who installed the new screen did a bad job installing it? . Or is it a software problem because new hardware was introduced to it?  I have an Asks N580D-F285T and for a while whenever I boot up my laptop there is an 80% chance that the screen will be black. The laptop clearly turns on as my backlit keyboard lights up, the fans inside start to spin and the screen is not the black that it is when the laptop is turned off if that makes sense. I have searched the web numerous times and countless hours, but have yet to find a solution that permanently solves the problem. What temporarily fixes the problem:. turn the screen on and off again with Fn + f7. rebooting my graphics driver with Win + ctrl + shift + B. opening and closing the lid numerous times, each time waiting until I don't hear the fans spinning anymore. turning the laptop off and back on again numerous times. I have to say I think I notice it happens less frequently when the laptop is plugged in compared to when on battery, but I'm not sure. Things that I've tried:. updating drivers from the Asks website for my model (though this exact model is discontinued). The drivers I've tried updating: graphics, motherboard, IOS, and probably some more that I can't recall. plugging in a second monitor to check if that did turn on: it did even when the laptop screen remained black. shining my phone's torch close to the screen to see if any image was visible but just very dimly lid: there was no image visible. resetting my power management plan to default configuration: first I thought this fixed it, but after rebooting the problem re-occurred. (I can reproduce the problem when the laptop is on by just turning the screen on and off again with Fn + f7). I thought about a complete format of the laptop, but I read that it shouldn't do much and I haven't found the time yet to complete such an intensive procedure. Any suggestions are more than welcome!  I resented new iPhone S and on the setup this time it installed some GD services. After the setup I got a permanent popup saying Guided access app unavailable contact you Every single function of the mobile stopped responding (touch, volume buttons, power button). Now it's locked and asking for my passcode which I can't enter because touch doesn't work. Laptop's not detecting it so I'm out of options, please help.  Is it just me or anyone else having issues with Message and signing in to Cloud ?  My CPU usage is very high at 20% and my memory is at 85%. Ive tried reinstalling games on my SD to make room ect but this issue just keeps reoccuring. I love my Px but as the gamer girl trope suggests, I know nothing about the manitence and issues with Pos. Any help much appreciated.  I hope this is the right sub. Whether it's youtube, a video saved to my phone, a voice note from WhatsApp or other messaging apps etc, notifications always ring out loudly and interrupt the listening process. Not only is it loud, but it I've noticed it actively lowers the volume of the audio I'm currently listening to before sounding out the notification so I almost always have to go back and re-listen to what I've missed. I would like to know if there's a way to silence notifications specifically when other audio is playing. I like to hear my notifications, so I don't want to have them on silent all the time, I just don't think they should be so intrusive when actively consuming audio content. I haven't seen anything on the internet that gives a solution for what I want, so is there none? . If not, I feel like this would be a nice Qo feature that smartphones really should have by now.  Hi. I ordered new parts to upgrade my Px. When I installed new components then the problems started. First it didn't want to start. Fans started spinning but when there was a click sound, fans stopped immediately. When I got my Px to start, it made terrible sound, something popped and smoke started coming from bottom of the motherboard. I cut the power immediately. After that, cooler SB 2. 0 header was little bit burnt. I got a replacement but same problems. After this, I dissemble every part and put everything back. Now it started but cooler fans are linking red. CPU is also warmer than normal. Highest idle temperature was 70 celcious. I reinstalled Windows, updated IOS, tried Windows troubleshooting, changing ports for my fans, SB 2. 0, etc. Nothing has seem to help. Current parts:. Motherboard: AUS RG STRIX B550-F Gaming. CPU: MD Ryzen 7 5800X. Cooler: Corsair iCUE H100i Elite Capellix. AM: Corsair Vengeance Pro GB 3600MHz DR4 32Gt (2x16Gt). Graphics Card: SI GeForce TX 3070 3X. Power supply: AUS RG STRIX 750W.

I recently got a KM switch (IOGEAR 2-Port SB DisplayPort Cable KM Switch) to switch between my work laptop and personal desktop. I have a DasKeyboard. My setup is that I have keyboard, mouse, and shared monitor that connects to the switch. The switch then outputs to my docking monitor (P2422He) for my work laptop can take all of the peripherals, so I just have to plug my SB-C to the laptop like a SB-C docking station. Note that the docking monitor is not the shared monitor that also connects my personal computer. Whenever I plug in my laptop to the docking monitor, the switch recognizes the mouse but not the keyboard. I always have to replug the keyboard that goes into the switch to get it recognized. I don't have this issue if I boot up my laptop while it is already docked. Is there a solution for this without needing to shut down computer before docking or without reconnecting the keyboard manually?  hey guys im trying to run a query on excel that's connected via sql server. it runs just fine when I'm connected to wifi, but it takes like 20 minutes to run on ethernet. i would prefer ethernet because everything else runs smoother (this query is the only thing that runs better). any ideas why it would run better over wifi? i have replaced the ethernet cord and this has happened on two different pcs. i didn't have this issue until i upgraded to windows 10. worked perfectly fine on windows 7 .  I have a Laptop and randomly one day my Mouse stops working, it is old so no worries I'll buy a new one. After buying a new one It works fine for a week but randomly also stop's working . Slowly I am losing my nerves, so I test everything that I know but nothing helps! . two mice have sometimes worked and then not again without warning or reason over the past two weeks, which has me very confused. Fixes that I have tried and didn't help: . Replace batteries. they work on a different Computer? ES! . device. new Mouse has bluetooth and that doesn't work either! . Please suggest anything and everything that could help me fix this issue. Thanks.  I'm on a gig up gig down connection with an A3000 router and plugged in to ethernet with a Cat 5e cable. The weird cap is exclusive to my Px as my xbox one 2 feet away is also plugged in via ethernet can hit 340+ maps download speeds. I've tried every single fix for various download issues I can find. My task manager never lists network usage above 1% so it's not being eaten up by random processes (Not that I haven't disabled windows update and gone through a dozen different other corollary services and several network regedits with no change one way or another. )This wasn't an issue at my previous apartment with comcast where I'd get 60-80 maps plus all the time over wifi, but happened after swapping to Ziply and ethernet at my new apartment (Wiki has the same weird cap as well I've tried)The only time I've gotten above that speed since the issue manifested was one time after hitting the network reset option under network and internet I was connected to the ethernet after the restart and it had the cap, then I connected to the wifi while still on the ethernet and suddenly went up to a 32 maps cap for 5 minutes and then it went back down to 12 maps. I have been unable to recreate this since and I am bloody tired of downloads that should be 5 minutes taking 10 hours.  If I screw in the cpu cooler my pc won't boot. Any amount of pressure will cause this. All pins on my 5600x look fine. I'm guessing it has something to do with the motherboard socket? 2 debug lights come on, CPU if there is some pressure and the RAM light if there is a high amount of pressure. Px will run but nothing happens, no bios or anything.  Hi guys,. For awhile now my Px has been having trouble. Im not sure what the cause is but normally it happens when Im playing games but sometimes it happens when its idle too, but randomly my PU while disable itself and gives me a black screen, I can still hear my audio in the background while that happens and it stays that way until I restart the computer. When I reboot the PU only one of my monitors work until I go in device manager and enable my PU again. Ive already tried using DD to get rid of drivers and reinstalling new ones but it still keeps happening. If anyone could help me Id greatly appreciate it. Thanks.  I have my old 2008 Macbook Pro that would have been too much to repair at the time, which was the display, which had liquid damage. I've tried sorting to an external monitor, but the Macbook now won't bootup. I removed the DD and got a ATA adapter, and have plugged into my current Windows Px, and it isn't recognized, which I gather is because it is HPFS. I downloaded MacDrive and even that isn't detecting it. I have an external hard drive and my current compute. I'm trying to get the data off and put it somewhere I can view the data.  I have a yoga 730 and all of the sudden the screen went black. when the laptop is unplugged I hit the power button nothing happens. If I plug in the power cord the fans are as loud as possible and still the power button does nothing. Is this a bios issue? Power issue?  So, today I got an information from one service that my password has been changed. I didn't do that. And when I checked my inbox I saw an mail from myself that my mail got hacked, containing my password to mail and that I have to send some money in bitcoin, as well as information that Trojan was installed on my devices. I successfully changed password to both mail and that service, but there are still some services that I haven't changed the password. Of course my main problem was that I used one password to everything (stupid, younger me). And I'm afraid about that Trojan (malwarebytes did not find anything). Also according to him he installed it because I clicked on some weird links, though I rarely use this email. Can anyone give me an advice what to do?  Last night I noticed that Powershell was running in the background for no apparent reason. After I checked the event viewer I also found a lot of daily powershell activity with the Task category: Execute a remote command. Is this normal behaviour? could it be the debloat script(Sycnex) I ran three weeks ago? that's the only time I used powershell. screenshot.  I can watch a 1080p 60 fps live stream but the estimated download time for a 90mb file is over 3 hours.  So im at my new work place and they have blocked things like spotify, youtube, twitch etc for the internet, anyway to bypass this for spotify? Its driving me nuts.  I recently put together a new computer (see specs at the bottom) and I might be going absolutely nuts but I swear the diagonal lines were not that jagged on my old computer (example from the button in the game Fortnite). Is there any way to fix this? All drivers are updated, I even installed Nvidia Control Panel with a fresh install but nothing changed. I tried changing some setting in the Nvidia Control Panel about sharpness and smoothness but nothing seemed to change even if I put the slider all the way to the left or right. I appreciate all the help possible! thanks in advance. Pc specs:. GeForce TX 3060 12gb GALAX. Ryzen 9 5900X. AUS UF Gaming x570-PLUS (Wiki). AM 2x8 DR4. Cooler Master Masterliquid ML360L V2, 360mm.

Why does my keyboard(anne pro 2 brown switches) shutter sometimes? I haven't even used it that much. Whenever I'm playing some games only my a and d buttons shutter sometimes and it also shutters outside of the games. I've cleaned it with compressed air and vacuum I reinstalled the keyboard drivers I even switched the keycaps one time and it seemed to work fine till it came back like a day has this happened to anyone else?

Bonus if it's low power/ straight 12 or 24v.  Hi, Today i launched my Px and for some reason I have random cut lines, like this on my second monitor: It interacts with the screen and does not just staying in one place. It also does not happen on my other monitor, just one! Im also on Windows 11 if thats any help. Things I've tried that hasn worked:. Switched the cable between both monitors but it stays on the same one. Restarted Px. Win + Ctrl + Shift + B to restart PU. Changed Monitor Hertz. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.  Title says it all. Turning on the MP I or MP In profile or dialing in the MP settings myself results in a non-posting desktop. It just bootloops 5 times or so quickly, switching from the red CPU led to the orange RAM led, then eventually it boots into a safe mode (not the windows one) and the RAM is reverted to non-MP speeds. The ram is listed in my motherboard VL list. Just a few days ago this setup worked perfectly fine (and had been for over 2 yrs) I'm unsure what went wrong :/. Troubleshooting steps taken:. - updating and downgrading IOS. - re-seating CPU. - re-seating the ram and busting the motherboard off w/ compressed air. - trying all sticks individually (same behaviour yet all 4 do boot). - clearing MOS.

Im sure many people are familiar with the issues Windows Live Messenger has with exporting emails. I have put at least 4 hours into trying to figure out how to do it and Im stuck. Im exporting from LM 2012 to Microsoft Outlook 32-bit, as it says to do so online. I can transfer just about everything, EXCEPT THE 2 OST IMPORTANT INBOXES. LM crashes at a certain point, like 300/1200, and wont go past that point. These emails are my dads entirety of his businesses he runs. They are too important to just forget about it. Im unbelievable stressed out, started back up on nicotine after being clean for 3 months. If anyone can help, PLEASE De S. Any and all information/help will be greatly appreciated. I am on the verge of throwing this thing in the river.  I accidentally clicked on a link within a spam email. I'm now receiving a lot of spam emails and my junk mail filter isn't catching them. Are there any steps to stop this (other than close the email account and start a new one)? . Thank you!  its making me type text.  The Px has detected two AM sticks every since I got it (16Gt total), today I noticed in the task manager it is only detecting 8Gt of AM. I made no changes and am wondering how to fix it. Is it possible a stick just broke? I have tried restarting my computer a few times and would appreciate any help on what could be causing this problem/how to fix it. Thanks.  Hi! . Just got my hands on a G5 Ultrawide today, and kept having an issue with the 165hz refresh rate. I'm using a De but the monitor keeps going black and returning to the source after a couple of seconds every few minutes or so. I've changed the cable and still the same issue. I am now using it at 100hz and the problem stopped. I've installed the driver suggested and still no luck and I don't think a 2080ti can't run at that resolution and speed (Hopefully). I hope someone can help me with this issue!  My Macbook air screen is cracked but when I turn down the brightness all the way down I don't see any cracks on the screen. I know I will probably have to replace the screen which was 481 bucks. Are there any cheaper ways to repair my screen and what is going on with my screen?  I have brand new cellularline java2 bluetooth earbuds and cant seem to figure them out. Do I charge them from the power outlet whilst theyre in the cast, or should I plug in just the case to charge first and then tirelessly charge the earbuds inside it? . Second thing. Whatever I do I cant get the right side earbud to work. Whilst Im perpetually confused trying to figure out the meaning of the left ones linking and flashing, the right one has not linked once. When connected to my phone, I can hear sound from the left earbud but not the right one. Whats happening? . Also at this very moment I have separately charged just the case and now have placed the earbuds inside to charge tirelessly. Again, only the left earbud is lit up sitting there, the other one isnt. Thanks in advance!  hello, so i went trough some updates and today armour crate program from asks showed i tried many things to locate the issue, and I found that is not present anywhere in my computer. not in program files, control panel program uninstalling, nowhere. also an error open pops up at startup. what should I do? could I possibly just download the . exe files for them? i tried to search for a download, but to no avail. thanks!  I have a problem where my Px won't boot anymore as soon as I install a Decklink Studio 4K from Blackgmagic Design. It doesn't even post, keeps or puts out an DMI signal from PU. Setup:. Asks P9D-M (C224 Chipset) . Xeno E3-1231 v3. 2 x 8gb AM Sticks . TX 960 2gb (in 8x PCIe 3. 0 port). Cooler Master 530W SU. before switching Decklink Studio 2 (1x PCIe 2. 0). now Decklink Studio 4K (4x PCIe 2. 0) . Mojo has a free 4x PCIe 3. 0 Port and 4x PCIe 2. 0 Port. I tried both with the L Studio 4K with resulting in no boot. I already tried following steps:. L Studio 4K firmware repair over SB Port. L Studio 4K in another Px, it works - so the card works. another 4x PCIe card (SD) in the P9D-M, it works - so PCIe lanes aren't the problem (and shouldn't be as there is no lane sharing according to manual). tried all IOS settings regarding PCIe - no effect. just L Studio 4K without PU and onboard GA, it works - so problem is combination of L Studio 4K and PU (and Mojo). I don't think it's a power problem as old and new card both shouldn't drain more than 25 W. Px will be used as stream encoder / for light graphics. I'm pretty clueless so tia everyone!  I've been using a basic SB2 switch to swap my peripherals between my work and personal computers for a couple years, but it's starting to die on me. I want to buy one that supports SB 3. 2 (for my webcam) but I've only been able to find one or two that do. And one thing I've noticed about the switch market is that the devices seem to be very buggy, prone to failure and defects, poorly designed, and there aren't very many trustworthy manufacturers making them. I'm wondering if there are any alternatives to switches. I can't imagine what they would be, but maybe someone out there can suggest something. I'm kinda amazed that the switch market is so poor when there must be a lot of people switching between machines - especially these days. EDIT: Some extra details about my current setup: I have a single monitor, mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam, and speaker set I'm switching between two devices: a work laptop and a personal desktop tower. I have the mouse, keyboard, and microphone plugged into the KM switch. My monitor has inputs for multiple devices, so I use that to swap between video and audio sources. It also has a couple SB inputs, but I was having issues with my microphone when I plugged it into that, so they're probably slow/low-power inputs. My keyboard and mouse are plugged into the switch. I had the microphone plugged into the switch too, but it was having issues there too, so right now I'm manually plugging it into whichever device I need to use it on. The webcam needs a SB 3. 2 connection, so I have to plug that directly into the device as well. (Fortunately I don't need to swap them very often. ).  Sorry if this isn't the best sub? . I'm following the above guide to make a new domain lab environment in Hyper-V. I'm doing this on a work computer and I just want to make sure that everything I set up is completely segregated. I don't want my domain to be autodetected and fuck things up. This isn't my area of expertise and I can't seem to find an answer.  Rooted up and fresh installed windows 10 on an old work laptop (Im In for this company) which has no options for connecting to a network and seems like it had network connectivity completely removed from it. Ethernet cable isnt working either, so I checked the device manager and several AN Miniport line items exist in the Network Adapter section. Cant figure out if the driver just needs updated or if its missing physical hardware to allow network connections. Any insight?  Hello, I think my TX 770 crashes a lot. Sometimes the screen just goes black out of nowhere. The sound also stops after a while. Sometimes there are colored strips with elements of the program that I had open before. If I'm lucky I get a windows device connected sound after a few seconds to a minute. And the main monitor comes on again. The second monitor remains black. If I'm unlucky, I have to restart the computer. The fans stay the same. I can't do anything during the stripes or the black screen. For example, passing a video, opening the task manager, etc. Surprisingly, the system has never crashed in the middle of a game. Often when I open new things. For example google, file explorer, steam, just any new window. My theory is that the PU clock is too high. When I'm in a game, the highest PU clock is 1228. 1MHz and the memory clock is 1752. 8MHz. Si Afterburners shows a PU clock of 1228MHz and a memory clock of 3505Mez. The TX 770 has a clock according to the internet of 1046MHz boost clock of 1085MHz. 1753MHz memory clock. What speaks against it is that the PU also crashes in the desktop. Where the frequency is intrinsically low. I have reinstalled the NVidea driver several times. Also completely reset my Px. I updated any drivers. The Gu has a max. temp. of 75C during a game. I have a GIGABYTE B560 He3, Crucial Ballistic black IMM Kit 16Gt, DR4-3200, L16-18-18-36, Intel Core i3-10105F, 4C/8T, 3. 70-4. 40Gz, be quiet! 600W, Samsung 870 1T, and a TX 770 Windforce. My system runs on windows 11. But it also crashes on windows 10. I have the feeling that the Px has began to crash after i upgraded my pc. Maybe some thing in the bios? . Any suggestions? Or other suspicious components? All parts are new except the SU and the TX 770 D.  6 months ago when I first got a new wifi installed, I had problems that my 2. 4gh laptop would keep disconnecting. I would be using the internet, and suddenly it would say address could not be and when I look down at the wifi icon it is disconnected. I would reconnect, and 5 minutes later it would happen again. Well I played around with the wifi settings, and somehow it fixed itself. But now I changed my modem, and the problem has come back, obviously because of the default settings. And I don't know/remember what I did to fix it! . Does anyone have any ideas what I could try? . The router is a TE Zahn H3600 V9, and I'm using a windows 10 laptop with only 2. 4gh wifi card. The problem is only on this laptop, and only on this wifi. I've tried changing the wifi channel, and disconnecting all other devices but it still has the problem.  This is my first build. Ive been having issues where the motherboard GA fault light will appear after a reboot (but not always), changing display inputs on monitors or it going to sleep mode overnight. It has been doing this consistently since the build has been complete. In order to recover it can take different tasks such as: pulling MOS and PU for about 10mins and reinstalling, shutting down and pulling power cable out of Px for about 30mins, a series of reboot. What I find strange is once the system is up and running it will run without seemingly zero issues for hours. But next day every time now it will not boot and Im forced to do one of these tasks above. Typically pulling MOS will fix the issue every time but other results vary. Tasks Ive tried:. -Repeat CPU. -Repeat memory. -Repeat M. 2 storage. -Plugged PU into other PCI port. -Slipped to other IOS chip on PU. -Repeat all power cables at motherboard/PU and power supply. -Adjust motherboard position (IOS Flash button stuck under backplate). -Reloaded Windows Of. -Updated all drivers/IOS for hardware. -Downgraded PU IOS one version. -Enabled D. O. C. P. profile in IOS. Px Build Info. CPU: Ryzen 5600x. PU: Radeon X 6600 X Speedster QICK 308. B: AUS UF B550Plus Wiki In. AM: Corsair Vengeance GB RO 2x8Gt 3600MHz. Px: EVA Gt SuperNOVA 80 Plus Gold 650W. Storage: Samsung VO 970 Plus 500Gt. Seagate Barracuda 2To. Im not sure what to do at this point to correct the issue. I did have a problem where my flashback light would blink whenever my Px was shut down but that is not a problem any longer. Typically my IOS page shows something strange when I do boot up such as saying the PU was not compatible with EFI or the latest being a new CPU was installed when I definitely did not install a new one. What could be the issue here? Do I have a compatibility issue or maybe Ive got a faulty motherboard? Id swap parts to test but this is my first build and I dont have any other components around to test with.  I updated my max on an external hard drive because my disk had no space and nothing that I could delete to clear space. The system storage was taking up over 80gb. So I updated on the external drive, unplugged the drive overnight, started it back up and it was back to the old version Of. If I cant update it on the disk, how do I solve this?  Hello all,. I have to apologise right away - English is not my first language and my school days were a while ago. My Problem: . I assembled my new Px last weekend (details below) and since then I have had the problem that I often have to start the Px several times until something is displayed on the screen. Two monitors are connected to the PU via display port. One display port and one DMI port are still free. This means: I start the Px, the mainboard LEDs indicate the classic boot process. The water cooling and the fans of the PU start. The mainboard LEDs do not indicate an error and everything runs normally - but I do not get a picture on the monitor. It doesn't change anything whether the monitor was previously in standby mode, completely switched off or switched on. Nor does it change anything which display ports I use. I don't think it's the monitor either, as it was already connected to the same PU on the old Px via display-port. Maybe that is important: I noticed that whenever I do NOT get a picture on the monitor, the keyboard and mouse lights are also disabled - looks like they are not getting any power. If the keyboard and mouse are illuminated shortly after the start, the image also appears shortly afterwards. Does anyone know what else I could try? Thank you for your help! . I have already tried that: . First, I reset the Px, formatted the operating system hard drive and reinstalled Windows 11. After that I updated the IOS/EFI to the latest version (not beta! ). Then I did all the updates via Windows Update, downloaded the latest drivers via the SI website, downloaded and installed Nvidia Geforce Experience and the latest drivers. What else you need to know: . The PU was already installed in my Px and worked perfectly there. I removed the CPU and checked all the pins on the mainboard - none of the pins are bent. I have not made any changes in the IOS/EFI. MP is disabled. CPU: Intel Core i9 12900K . Mainboard: SI Z690 Force WII . PU: Nvidia TX 3090 . AM: Kingston Fury DR5-6000 (32 Gt) . Power Supply: 1000W . Windows 11 (64 Bit), installed on a M2 SD.  I've had this issue for several months, it happens maybe once or twice a week, and I don't know where to begin diagnosing the issue. It starts with an audio shutter for a brief second, and my displays immediately freeze. Any playing audio continues, but it seems the Px isn't receiving any input (I can hear discord calls but they can't hear me, keyboard shortcut for restarting graphics driver doesn't cause the been sound). I've had this issue on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. I've tried using both the game ready and studio drivers for my PU (initially with game-ready drivers this was happening frequently with blender open). Might be worth mentioning I have a 1440p 144hz display with Sync on, a 2160p 60hz display, and a graphics tablet display. How can I go about diagnosing and solving this issue? Has anyone else had an issue similar that they've resolved? . Windows 11. i9-9900K. TX 3080 Ti (founders). 32Gt DR4 (4x 8Gt). Thank you.  I am conscious that in the past some (very normal, everyday) images of my child have been posted on social media. I have recently become aware that even these normal images are used by the wrong types of people and even on the dark web. I really want to understand what I can do to destroy their online presence, if anything?  I just used my old laptop's internal hard drive as a drive to transfer files. I used a usb to sata adapter so I can plug it in in my other laptop. Since I do not currently have the time to transfer 200gb of files, I thought to myself that I'll just leave it like that since it's working anyways. After plugging it in and out and using it for a few times, it suddenly became unreadable. I tried plugging it on a different hub and Pos and it still unreadable. It shows up on the taskbar whenever I plug it in but not on the . I checked it in disk management and it's there but it says must initialize a disk before logical disk manager can access It's also showing that disk 1 (the unreadable hard drive) is not initialized and is unallocated. Utf. Badly need help since a lot of files are on this drive. Also photos and memories that I really value. Thank you so much.  So this is kind of hard to explain. I have my headphones jack in my monitor and it was working fine for the longest time when the issues suddenly started. The issue: when there is no audio playing on my Px, the sound channel with a small static sound after about 5-10 seconds. When sound is played, it again with a similar sound effect. The sound reminds me of someone turning cord in the headphones jack. Re-installing sound drivers (through both device manager and geforce drivers) helps but only for a while. The problem seems to be coming back after some time when randomly when restarting my pc, requiring another reinstall of the sound driver. I'd just like to know what can cause this and is there a permanent solution.  can a b350ma mainboard support the Ryzen 5600g? . Bios is the latest. couldnt find anything valuable on the internet.  I have 16By AM and at win 11. Neither I game nor do i use AM logging app. Average AM use is 4-6 Gt. Never seen crossing 8 -9 Gt. My pagefile. sys is equal to AM. Recommended size by windows on my system is 4Gt. I never went using more than 10Gt AM. Then why did Win created 16Gt of pagefile. sys. Never had faced such issue. Generally pagefile. sys is 3-4 Gt on my system. So, is there any way to know which software is requiring win 11 to create such a huge virtual memory as pagefile. sys?  I clicked on an ad in my google app which caused infinite pop ups to call a number. When this happened I accidentally pressed call and someone answered. I didnt even peep a single sound and they hung up 5 seconds later. Then, I factory rested my phone and cleared website data. I am worried about accidentally pressing call though. Should I be worried and is my phone safe to use?  I was just watching youtube and out of nowhere the screen just flickered out of place.  My pc system is underperforming in games, the link here says I'm supposed to get 130fps on ultra 1080p in bf but I am only getting 60-70fps, i tried to enable amp, but my bios doesn't even have a amp option, mob is asrock h310m-g/m. 2 and I have installed the latest drivers but still no amp option. I am also getting below average score on timespy with a score of 7234 when the average is 7790, any reasons why ? I am very stressed as I just changed my PU to a 3060 and am very disappointed with my system's results.  Hi! i have a dell 5559 laptop which i have been trying to fix for a long time since im unable to install windows 10 on it but im not able to since it gets stuck on the initial blue windows logo and the spinning dots get stuck in the same place everytime but recently i was able to install an ubuntu and its working kinda well other than some lag and ive tried many ways to install windows and the problem remains even if i try to install win 10 w/o the had and also i tried 2 diff usb sticks and i tried the usb sticks on other laptops and it's working fine. Has anyone else faced a similar issue? . And if someone is well versed with ubuntu can anyone teach me to install win 10 w/o a usb directly from the os?  Bought a 4K Amazon Fire Stick a couple months ago. I bought the 4K version because I have a 4K tv, so thought there would be no problem at all. However, when watching anime, animated shows or animated movies there is a pixel shutter. When there isnt pixel shutter the image isnt up to the 4K quality I paid for. I thought it may be the WII connection, so I bought the Ethernet adapter and connected it to the booster box I have in my room. That didnt help. I couldnt find any information on the internet and I dont have the money to buy a new tv or another fire stick. I would have sent it back however, I cant seem to find the box, even tho I always keep my boxes. I decided to put up with some pixel shutter every now and again. I recently came down with a cold and decided to watch some anime in the living room, rather than my bedroom. To do that I moved my fire stick from the tv in my bedroom to the tv in the living room. In the living room we also have a 4K tv. When I started watching I noticed there was no pixel shutter and that I suddenly had the 4K quality I paid for. Is there anyone who can help me fix my problem? . Edit: I am quite tech savvy and have built two Pos myself but wouldnt class my self as a tech expert so need some help.  Before this the TD BSD only happens once in a while when I exit a game, but now everytime I boot up my Px it goes to desktop, works fine for a minute, then BSD. I uninstalled the drivers using du, then when I try to install an nvidia driver (tried three different versions: 466. xx, 511. 33, and the latest. ) after the screen adjusted to the recommended resolution the BSD pops up not finishing the installation. Is my card dead or do I just have to reformat my Px?  So earlier today I wanted to look up youareanidiot. cc just for the experience as I knew I could turn my computer of. I now wanted to watch a youtube video, but my computer now randomly crashes if I try to do this. Probably because of the youareanidiot-virus? How do I fix this?  Last Friday I wanted to pay a hard that could only run on windows 7 so I downloaded the latest version of VMware. When I ran the machine it kept sending band error message. I when out of the room for 30 second db to get something but when I returned the computer was dead. I tried changing it but it didn't work nothing light up not even the charging ED. The only thing that keeps happening is the heating coil getting really hot but that's about it nothing else works not even the fan. I would really appreciate some advice on what happened and how can I fix it.  I can only connect to ethernet. I've tried everything I've found online, but nothing seems to work. I'm assuming I'm missing some kind of wifi adapter, but id what to do about it. In device manager under Network adapters, all that is showing is Realtek Pole 2. 5Gb Family Controller.  Recently, I've been getting innacurate AM reports from Task Manager. Windows recognizes that I have 16Gt of AM 15. 9Gt usable, but Task Manager is reporting that 970B is using up 22% of my AM. That math just doesn't add up. I've been trying to solve this for weeks, repeating AM, updating IOS, etc, etc- but seems to work. More frustratingly, there doesn't seem to be anywhere I can find someone who's had the same issue.  I stupidly applied threadlocker to my dell laptop. I tried with various type of extractors but it seem the screw are locked to the laptop, are there any other way to remove it except drill to the screw completely and replace the laptop cover?  I have no idea what's causing this and it's driving me insane. If I middle click in a browser, to enter scroll mode, it is immediately cancelled. If I hit or hold control, the zoom level immediately starts decreasing. If I click a dropdown box it immediately closes before I can select an option. If I hover over my start menu, it scrolls down. If I hover over a Windows settings page, it scrolls down. In discord, I cannot grab the scrollbar and drag it around, it immediately gets let go. I just noticed now when selecting a flair for this post that my browser (Firefox) immediately scrolls right when possible. This started yesterday for no apparent reason and persisted through a full reboot. I used a website to check my mouse and keyboard buttons and nothing appears to be being pressed. I don't even know what to search for to troubleshoot. Windows 10.  I have the weirdest issue with a customers computer, He stated that when he turns off his Bluetooth/keyboard accessories In mouse and keyboard, after shutting down the computer it will not boot back using the PU, he has to plug into the motherboard to get any picture and the PU will not display or be detected in IOS, he has to repeat the PU for it to be recognized again and then it works until he shutdown the computer and turns off his Bluetooth/wireless usb devices. I have recreated the issue with a Wiki dongle plugged in. Now this does not happen if you don't use the usb ports in the back of the machine. It is so weird, I have tried updated bios to latest version, fresh install of windows. I tried another video card and same issue. It is a Gigabyte z490 elite motherboard and 3080 ti gigabyte.  So I've been using a Russian mnemonic keyboard input ( layout) on my laptop for my college classes. Some cyrillic letters of this input have to be typed by typing two letters for example by typing + you would get and usually there is like a pause in the input between typing the letters. But in the last week or so every time i try to type some letters like , , which are part of such combo they get typed twice like cc, and so on, and I'm unable to type all of these combined letters. Everything works fine with the on-screen keyboard and in the windows search bar, it's Microsoft Word and browsers that have this problem. I've tried updating, scanning, using a restore point, and nothing has solved this. Please help. Px: when booking up the laptop it usually works fine for a couple of minutes then it all comes back.  Windows tells me that there is 119 gigs of apps and features being used but when look into it in apps and features and add everything up there should not be more than 35 gigs being used. What is happening?  So I've installed a custom rom(LINEAGE Of) while performance and battery has been very good I've been having issues with these apps mainly with Netflix not loading and fortnite having PN, cheating error. I'm not too sure what's wrong since I've confirmed my phone isn't rooted. Can someone help me since I've been searching for help online for bout 5 days now and i can't seem to find solutions.  Hello. I have a galaxy j7 that I have never been able to get it to be seen by my computer. A month ago i left it with 0 percent battery. Now I have charged it and tried to turn it on but it gave this error. I have never tried to root it or install custom os. I can't get to the recovery mode but I could get to the download mode but since my pc doesnt recognize the phone i am just stuck. Can someone help me with that? I really need this phone.  Today I repeated my ram stick and now my pc wont display, I have already taken out the cms battery and reseattes the graphics card. I am so confused, some help may be great.  Hi all,. I finally upgraded my old Px but am now running into a lot of trouble. I upgraded the Mojo, CPU, and AM. I attached my Microsoft account beforehand, per the guide I was following, hoping that Windows would boot without any issue after the stop as I've not changed my SD or hard drive. But the Bios menu said it found no bootable devices. I've made a Windows Installation Media on a thumb drive, but now it looks like it's going to wipe my data on whatever drive I install Windows on. I'd prefer to put it on my SD for quick boots, but I'm worried that the game I'm playing may not have my save backed to the cloud think to check before this). I also don't have a ATA to SB cord to copy the files beforehand. So my first question: is there any way to use the bios menu to access/copy file from a hard drive/SD to a SB drive attached to the Mojo without having to go through an Of? Next, if I opt to just install Windows on the hard drive (because I'm pretty sure my save would be on the SD), can I later move the Of to the SD without issues? Final, more niche: does any one know how to check if a Steam game has a cloud save/backup through your Steam account on a browser? The computer I'm on doesn't have Steam and cannot (work device). I appreciate any help you can provide!  Hello. I recently moved and was looking at all the in the living room there's two ethernet cables that run under the floor which are cemented in. The issue, the previous owner, before moving out, has cut those wires. and left nothing, like he held the clippers to the floor and Is there anything that I can do to resolve this and still maintain a solid connection? Maybe I should let someone come over who does MD CB soldering to pin connect? Would this be a viable option? I'd add a picture but I'm not allowed in this group. Thank you for your time.  I'm trying to buy a Lucie rugged hard drive for a mid-2014 Regina Macbook Pro. But I cannot find out which one is compatible with my computer (particularly the cable). I recently bought a Lucie rugged drive that is compatible with my computer (and I didn't have to buy any extra cables or adapters), but I don't have it with me right now. I thought it was the SB-C one, but I don't think even have that on my computer, and yet it works. Any help is appreciated.  So I'm assuming this may be due to normal wear and tear of my hardware, but when I first build my pc in 2019 it would boot to the windows log in page in 1-2 seconds. Now 3 years later, it's taking an abnormally long time. To be clear, I can log in perfectly and the windows log in appears normally just as always, its just from the moment I hit the power button on my computer and see my Px turn on, it hits the normal motherboard logo, then both monitors are black for 10-15 seconds, then it hits the windows log in page. i assume its just loading but id if that long is normal. Some things I've already tried: re-plugging power/dp/hdi cables, updated windows updates, checked my PU driver for updates. anything else to try? or is this normal? Also im on Windows 10 not 11.  I noticed recently that my settings app on windows 11 won't load. I tried looking for a fix, but many of the sites recommended using the app settings command on the settings app, which for me just loads settings and then crashes that same as just running settings. I've tried reinstalling preinstalled apps through powershell, tried a thing to manually install updates that I can't find after I restarted (trying to run windows update doesn't work either), tried like 10 different ways to use powershell to reinstall settings. Nothing has worked. It still just loads up a window for settings and then crashes.  . Just put together a Px for the wife today. Everything boot up fine, SU running, all fans running when I turn the computer on but nothing else is registering. DMI plugged in but can't find display. Usually on my Px my keyboard caps lock, scroll lock would light up but I plugged it into the new Px it doesn't so to me it's not registering. I took the M. 2 from old laptop and put onto the motherboard. Has windows installed already, would that be an issue? Not sure what I am missing and help is greatly appreciated. Specs:.

So I have been using Amazon music for about a month now and recently I've had an issue where when I go to my offline music and click on my playlist, it gives me a message that says the filters I've set don't match anything in the playlist, even thought I never set any filters. It gives me the option to press a button that says reset all filters but the button does nothing. If anyone has any information it would be greatly appreciated. I'm using the Amazon music app on an up to date Android phone. The downloaded music is saved to my sd-card in my phone. If there is anymore information needed I will be happy to provide it.  I can not connect to a certain website () because of the fact that some program, does not matter why, disabled access to it. Now, I've checked so it can't be there, I checked the firewall, still not. what else is there to check? I believe that I have been short, sweet, concise, and to the point. Please help! . Thanks in advance!  A couple days ago I finished building a new Px and went to turn it on but got a blank screen and a boot light. We fiddle with for hours and figured out that it might be an old bios issue but could not get it to work again with an older version of bios on a SB. Currently using:. SI b550m am4 board. MD Ryzen 5600x processor. Were currently looking for new boards since that seems to be the problem, but every time I put one into Px part picked with the same CPU or a 3600x it has the same If the motherboard is using older bios version then upgrading bios will be necessary to support cpu message. Im just concerned that thisll be an issue with every board/processor combo that we use. As far as I am aware the graphics card, AM, CPU, etc is all installed correctly and cables are run correctly. Any help would really be appreciated.  It doesn't happen all the time but sometimes my pc will randomly start lagging super hard while watching videos on chrome. I have to force a reset by holding the power button because using the mouse takes so long and doesn't even recognize clicks most of the time when this happens. Not sure what is causing this. I'm using a pretty new custom built pc. Of - Win10. CPU - MD 5950x. Memory - 32Gb G. Skill Trident Z Neo. PU - NVIDIA Geforce TX 3090 E. SSD - Sabrent Rocket 4+: 1tb and 4tb. Mojo - Asks RG Crosshair III Formula.  Recently I've downloaded malware pretending to be tinytask from a website that looked pretty legit at first since it's the first thing that popped up when I searched tinytask then after that as usual i did a virus total scan and it had like 4 trojans inside it but i never ran it. I did this last saturday and I've been paranoid since.  I touched my card with dirty hands and it's covered in gross stuff now, how can i clean it without ruining the card or damaging the chip? can i run it under the tap?  I've been trying to set up a third screen on my pc but none of my screens have a displayport, so I'd want an adapter from displayport (male) to DMI or GA. I've heard that GA is the oldest type of port out of the two so I'm opting to get an adapter for displayport - DMI. Now apparently these adapters are rather rare and all that I have found, also have a SB plug (male). Why is this? Would this affect how I set up my third screen? Is what I'm trying to do a horrible idea?  Just bought a new pc and the games I play will have stuttering in it. Like frames are find and then just stop for like half a second. Or quarter second. Running windows 11. I never had these problems with my old pc. Is this a software thing I can fix? I've swapped out gfx cards and still have same issue.  Hi, I have no clue why, but on my laptop, panopto and every streaming service runs at a constant speed, but on my Px with the Wiki dongle that I have, it just does this when streaming it (imgur lol below). Could it just be an issue with the Wiki dongle.  Hey there! . I currently have Nord PN + dedicated In from Nord PN as I need it for work (VIP Tool). Unfortunately Nord is not as reliable as I need it to be:. 1. Speed drops from 250 without PN to 40 with PN when I am connected with Ethernet (I am changing location to a place with 100 download speed and am a bit scared here). 2. Calls are always breaking up on MicroSip (people can't always hear me / I can't fully hear them in-between sentences). It's like the connection is not stable. I am constantly switching between DP and CP but none of those options are reliably good. Can you recommend more reliable companies for PN + dedicated In? . Do you have any other recommendation to solve my issues? . I am currently in Mexico. The Server is in california. Would it help to choose a closer server? . Edit: please no comments about why I need the In and if my boss can't give me access to the tools differently. That is not an option right now. I need a solution that is within my power to change. And I don't have the option to set up my own server at home as I won't be home/in the same place for another year. Thanks.  whats the cause of this guys? my pc shocks when its turned off if i turn it on power supply surges detected error on asks motherboard when i go on bios the voltage stuff is up and when i afd it for a while its normal and doesnt go up even on normal use and gaming it just that when pc is off not like entirely off air is still alive it does the error.

I have the monitor output running into my pc (mic) on my mainboard. I can only hear sound on my left side. I found a fix, but im not happy with the fix. The fix I found is accessibility settings to mono audio. really annoying to always set up listen to this device and mono audio just to play a bit Skate 3. Any ideas?  I tried to send a video to myself through my email address from my phone to my laptop but the video was too large and it was to A few days later it finally sent and now it wont stop sending, with me receiving the same email 1-3 times a day. It was sent over my gmail account using the mail app on my iphone to my windows computer. I have tried to cancel it but have been unsuccessful. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I recently started having issues with my pc following a motherboard/cpu/ram change. New components :. CPU . B . AM . The issues I have come across are as follows and happen what seems like randomly:. 1- Px acts like the ctrl key is pressed. When this happens, pressing the ctrl key seems to deactivated it which is sticky keys behavior but I have sticky keys deactivated. It has on rare occasion kept acting like the key is still being pressed. 2- Px acts like the shift key is pressed. There is nothing I can do about this, it starts and stops on its own, unplugging and replugging my mouse and keyboard does not stop this either. 3- Px starts writing non stop. When I select a text field whether in a browser, in game or discord, ded starts to be written infinitely. The very weird solution to this is unplugging my mouse? It does not have any key mappings that would let it write the letter d or e. The worst weird behavior that has happened was new folders were being non stop created on my desktop and following some key spamming from me it started opening file explorers non stop where at that point I hard shut down the pc. This has happened only once. None of these issues happened prior to my hardware change, I use a Racer huntsman elite keyboard and a Racer naga trinity mouse and have been for over a year now. I've had recurring issues with my mouse a few months back where replugging it fixed them(I can't remember for the life of me what they were but I just know I couldn't use my buttons and had to switch to only using my keyboard when it happened while playing wow). Those issues stopped and never happened again without me doing anything. The 12 mouse buttons are mapped to shift+1 to keys on the keyboard. I've just now mapped the letter to one of my mouse buttons to see if it is a keyboard issue and will see if it is a mouse issue by unplugging it and using a text field with my keyboard. The environments in which it has happened were when I was playing wow and had chrome/discord open or just chrome and discord. There is usually a stream playing on my browser when this happens. Although I've had Ellen ring on one monitor with wow on another monitor and my friend's discord screen share on a third monitor with no issues whatsoever. Thanks for any help, I'll report back with more findings when this happens again. Edit: The shift key is currently stuck, this happened after I recreated the last instance where this happened, running wow while downloading a game from the epic games store. I should also point out that I ran all the windows updates after I booted my pc post hardware change. I can also confirm that the shift key being pressed persists through my mouse being unplugged or keyboard being unplugged, oddly enough sometimes when I press the t key mapped to my mouse, it keeps spamming it until i click the mouse button again. Edit 2: After about an hour of having the shift key stuck, I found a potential solution online that said to hold down both shift keys for 5 seconds and it somehow worked. Still doesnt tell me why this is happening but at least I have a work around in the meantime.  . After freezes, usually these will happen:. BSD Critical Process Died. Unfreezes and everything goes about normally. Occurrence:. Used to happen, was stable for a few months. now it's back and more often. Unpredictable. Event Viewer.

I have a problem with windows start,search,message,sound and other things not working and ethernet cable unidentified . So question will resting my pc fix these?  Of: Windows 11 Home 21H2. Hi. This has been happening ever since I got this new Px. If I wasn't on a window for quite some time and then alt-tab it becomes black and I cannot see its contents in the preview. Example pic of alt-tab. This seems to only happen to some Chromium-based windows (such as Electron apps) like Chrome, Notion, Discord or the Steam Store. Oftentimes a similar (but different) thing happens on YouTube. Where on the alt-tab preview I can see the website, but the video player itself is not there (only the background color). Or when the video is full-screen it's full black. Why is this happening? How can I fix it? My Px should be able to handle that without any problems (Ryzen 3700X, TX 3060 Ti). Thanks in advance.  Hi all. Just got Yakuza 7 and going through settings. For some reason changing the resolution to above 1080p cuts out all audio within the game. It comes back immediately when I change it back to 1080. Also getting screen tearing when I go above 60 fps but I assume that's a different issue and I'm less worried about it. For reference, I am playing this plugged into my Lt C1 tv via DMI. Cable is supposedly 2. 1 DMI. All audio and video drivers are up to date but there are two Nvidia audio drivers and a Realtek driver so unsure of which to try to mess with. Graphics card is 3080ti. Windows 10 Pro. This is all very new to me, any help is appreciated.  I have an old Dell Latitude E5410 that I use, it has an external monitor as the main screen is broken. A few weeks ago Windows stopped working and after seeing the Dell boot screen it would go to a black screen with a linking line in the top corner. The only way I could use it was to press f12 at the Dell boot up screen and go into the boot options. Today I done that and f12 isn't working and any alternate keys aren't either. If you know what I could do please tell me.  Hello, So ever since I updated to Windows 11 a few weeks ago, every time I turn my computer on its brightness is mixed and I need to turn it down. How do I change this? For context, I have an ps 15 and almost always have it plugged in.  Hi there. I have a problem where my Px keeps disconnecting itself from the internet, both ethernet and Wiki. Whenever I power up my Px, it works fine, and I can use it for a bit, but then after a while, the internet on the Px stops working entirely. I at first thought it was an ethernet issue, so I tried to Wiki, which would work for a minute, before it too stops working. It seems to happen when I use Twitch, or play League of Legends, although I am as of yet unsure if that is coincidental, or the cause, as I am on both very frequently. The internet itself is fine, every other device connected to it is fine, its just my Px. I checked if my drivers needed updating, and they do not. I have checked the power management settings for my adapters, as I have heard that sometimes the Px can turn them off to conserve power, but that setting is not enabled for them. What could the issue be? I've trawler through Google and various forums and subreddits for answers but haven't yet found one.  I was trying to fix the right click lag issue on windows 10 then I realized my regedit doesn't have a directory can anyone help me?  My old iPhone has these things covering the screen making it unusable Im pretty sure theres no way to fix it but just in case Im posting here, its like a static but doesnt move the phone is pretty ruffed up as well but i think its done.  So i bought a new drive, sandisk 3. 1 256gb. All fine till i tried installing windows on it, ive had a few failed attempts and reminded myself that i havent checked my storage in a long time, in the meantime i already deleted windows from the usb. Basically, ive tried using all sorts of possible diskpart commands, third party software and i cant get it back to 256gb can anyone help?  I booted my Px for the first time in about a month or month and a half, and . My first instinct was to restart the computer and swap to Windows through the IOS/Boot selection screen, but my keyboard wasn't working. I thought maybe it was an issue with my KM switch but when I plugged in the keyboard directly, it still wasn't working. Just to make sure, it wasn't an issue with the keyboard cable, I plugged the keyboard into my MacBook (with a SB C to A adapter) and it worked fine. Then I tried charging my phone through like 4 ports (including 1 of my case ports) and my phone would show the initial charging animation but then show it wasn't charging. Everything else seems to be working fine but I can't really confirm without being able to boot into a working Of. Motherboard is ASRock B450M Steel Legend.  Hi. I have a pc I built a few years back with an Asks Maximus III Hero B and 2 x 8Gt G. Skill Trident Z 16Gt Kit DR4 3200MHz AM. I just bought another 2 x 8 Gt sticks of the exact same ram and plugged them in and nothing. The screen didn't come on although the pc seemed to be turning on. Any ideas? . Thanks in advance. Ken.  Hi all,. About 2/3 months ago my build all of a sudden didn't want to wake up from sleepmode anymore, but only if it was in sleepmode for a couple of hours. It also didn't boot anymore unless powercable was removed for a couple of hours (sometimes, however, I got lucky and it would boot after I repeated some stuff or just after waiting a few minutes). Although it wont boot, rgb led on mob would be on, but when pushing power button the fans would turn on, turn off after 2 secs and nothing happens. To troubleshoot I started removing different parts to see if it would change anything. But even when it was just the mob with cpu/cpu fan and psu it would still show the same behaviour (sometimes working, sometimes not). I understand that it can't boot with just cpu, but I wanted to see if I at least got the check lights on mob, which didn't happen. I also ordered a new psu to check if that was the issue, but with the same set up (mob out of case, just cpu and cpu fan) still nothing. Now I figured it was the mob as this was the only part left and if it would be the cpu I would at least get a check led on the mob telling me the cpu was the issue. I have MA'd the mob, asks it, but to no avail and I still have the same issue. Has anybody encountered something like this before? Any idea what the issue could be? At this point I am thinking about just buying a new mob (and psu to be extra extra sure) and hope that works. But since it's still under warranty that feels rather silly if it is the mob. BUILD:.

I have an old Px that I use for audio work. It's using an AUS z170m-plus motherboard with 4 PCIe slots. PCIEx16_1 and PCIEx16_2 (long ones) which are sharing IRQ assignments, and then PCIEx1_1, PCIEx1_2 (short ones) which each have their own IRQ assignments. For the aforementioned audio work, I have something plugged into just about every SB port (keyboard, mouse, external sound card, security dongle for audio software, and external DD for audio samples), and the computer has trouble handling it all. Usually the mouse just doesn't work half the time. When it's just the mouse plugged in, it works fine. After scoring forums and talking to the fell at my local comp store, I've come to the conclusion that it might be a good idea to just install a SB expansion card. The way that my CI slots are set up is the PCIEx16_1 with my PU is at the top, with the PU's fans pointing down. Then the two short ones and the other long one at the bottom. Because of the two long ones sharing IRQ assignments, I'm assuming it would be better that I install the expansion cards into one of the short slots (please correct me if I'm wrong), but the top one is underneath the PU's fans, so can't use that one. If I were to install the card into the bottom short one, the card would then be covering the PU's fans, causing a) a ventilation problem, and/or b) the expansion card to be blasted by hot air. Please help, how can I proceed. I'm at my wits end.  I know the CD needs to be replaced but is there a way to slow it down.  I just upgraded my motherboard and ram, suddenly my windows needed to be activated again and i cannot use my already paid original activation code because it said that that code was used by a previous device. How tf does it not allow me to use new hardware with the same os? I already paid for it.  I've had it for over a year now and it's been working fine but when I tried to record a quick audio in audacity today error -9997 popped up. As I was fixing it I noticed that the microphone can only record in mono and when I finally could record audio I couldn't play it. Anyone knows what happened and how to fix it? Thanks in advance!  I have a Gigabyte Aero 15 notebook with i7 7700He and TX 1060 graphics card, which was the first Aero model that Gigabyte released. I have so far used the (old) drivers from the driver software that Gigabyte provides. Until Ellen Ring, I had no problems in games. I run latest version of Windows 10. But with the old drivers I have graphic errors in Ellen Ring, ok no problem, I have to update the graphic card driver. After that the graphics errors are gone but it comes much worse. Either only the game crashes or the graphics card driver causes bluscreens. The bluscreens says different things, like page fault in nopaged area (nvlddmkm. sys) or video dxgkrnl fatal error. I have already tried many things, uninstalled driver in safe mode, reinstalled. With and without DD. Intel drivers updated. Installed Geforce Experience (I think that makes it worse). Google brings up similar errors from other users with similar notebook models, which typically did not resolve. What can I do? Is there any alternative graphics card drivers I can try? Is there something wrong with nVidia Optimus? Do I have to reinstall Windows 10, I wanted to avoid that until now. Thanks for your help!  Hello there, I am trying to do a fresh install from Win7 to Win10 on a Dell N5040 laptop and Im getting this black screen with no readable info. Then I just press anything and the laptop just restart. See image below. Sorry screen is reflecting a lot.  The title says it all, I had a random unexpected shutdown or restart and when I checked the reliability monitor and the event logs I noticed that my dts audio driver and a few other processes are frequently crashing. In the event logs I noticed that I get no error code for the shutdown, (which suggests that its a hardware issue as the system shutdown so fast it couldnt write the error codes in the event log. But I individually ran each component through a ten minute max power stress test and it performed perfectly fine, which leads me to believe that its a software issue now.

I recently started a 100% remote job, and I am trying to set up my ideal FH set-up, which is as follows: my monitor is on my desk, connected to the work laptop I am using. At the end of the day, I disconnect my work laptop, connect my personal laptop, and continue to use that with the monitor for the rest of the evening / weekend. What Im having trouble with is finding a device that can make this happen AND work between the two laptops. The In tech at my job (shout-out Matthew! ) suggested a KM switch.

So recently ive been having a strange problem with my external had: when i transfer some files to it from my main pc and then i use it on my laptop, it can't see any of the new files i transferred. In order to see them i need to use had recovery every single time. I tried formatting the drive but the problem persists. It did fall once but no files inside it were corrupted. Can anyone help me understand what happened?  I tried to clone a 128Gb with Truecrypt encrypted drive to a 1Tb drive with Clonezilla. Maybe the Notebook lost power while trying to do it? . Maybe the Truecrypt messed things up? . I dont know. Whatever happened, the 1Tb disk no longer shows up in most utility. I can make it show up in gnome-disk-utility, but not format it in there. Also no terminal command makes it show up as sub. I was also able to make it show up in the windows device manager too, but not do more there either. Is there anything I can do except send the drive back? . There is no data ob the disk that should be saved. The first thing I did was trying to clone the other drive to it, so no data loss there.  Hi there, been having a bad time. My computer is no longer working properly. After some minutes working okay, the graphics start glitching (the images freezes and a pattern of squares appear on the screen, see image below) then the audio glitches and I have to turn it off. I believe my PU (a TX 770) might be dying. Could it be anything else? . I tried cleaning the PU and the AM, they are connected properly. Thank you in advance.  On my phone, google assistant will not work. I've tried clearing cache, I've even tried resetting my phone, but nothing. Google assistant will not recognize a single thing I say. It can hear me if I hit my phone, as I can see the sound bars moving when I do that, but it cannot hear my voice at all. I know my phones microphone isn't bad, because I've tested it and it works fine, although when listening to it with headphones, I cannot hear any audio from the left channel. I've also tried factory resetting the phone, didn't work. Google assistant app doesn't work either. My phone is a Huawei P30 Pro running Android 10. No root.  So I have a hp Pavilion x360, was working fine, I left it plugged overnight the other day and now it wont charge. It turns on fine and works okay but the elephant in the room is that It only turns on with the battery and it doesnt charge. Took it to a repair shop and the guy there said my motherboard is gone totally that I have to buy a new motherboard. If its dead totally how can the laptop still work fine with the power supplied from the battery? . Things Ive Its not the charger. Its not the charging jack. Can it be repaired or I should just cave? The replacement is more than half the cost of the laptop, so yeah.  I've always had consistently stable ping in games (40-ish ms). This year, I went away for two months, and when I came back, I realized that ping in games suddenly never went under 75 ms, sometimes hovering 90-ish. Not the biggest of deals, but it's noticeable and very annoying. I can't for the life of me figure out why. I can't contact the SP because the internet is in my landlord's name the only person using it tho). I've tried lots of things, so if someone could suggest something, I'd be grateful. So far, I've tried swapping the ethernet cables, reinstalling network drivers, resetting the router, flushing NS, changing NS server and making sure I'm not overloading the internet. I checked multiple games with same results. I also compared the ping with my phone's 4G ping and they were practically the same, even though I'm using a wired connection. Stamped here.

Hello guys,. I have been having some performance issues for a while with my laptop and I am not sure what else I could do. The issues at hand are the following, first when I play any game that I can clearly run with my specifications I encounter constant frame drops,some games more than others and in no particular logic. My model is Predator PH315-52Specs:. Intel i7 2. 60gh 9750h Coffeelake Windows 10 64Stock 16gb Ram Dual Channel 2666hzGtx 1660ti 6gb driver 511. 65. For instance, I will play and I will be blocking at 144fps with sync or 240 without. Running the game conservatively for competitive advantage some graphical settings are turned off and overall profile is high-medium. Mid game I will have sudden fps drops to 30 sometimes 40 for a second and then recover. Then for instance if I play Battielfield 1 I will also have fps fluctuations but more stable than cso (which is weird) at higher graphical settings (ultra) but stillmy fps will sharply decline to around 56-60 from 110-120 without seeming to be affected by intensity of combat or effects at the moment. Now what's weird is this doesn't seem to be affected by adjusting my graphical settings in no way shape or form. I bought Squad recently and if I set the game on Ultra 50-60 fps Low 50-60fps all fluctuating and freezing despite minimal or maximum graphic settings. Other games I had issues with are TA 5 and Rainbow six siege. I also have random BSD error 0x000000 and its seemingly unrelated to the current load or lack there off on the Px which I don't know is connected or not to the current fps issues and I haven't been able to resolve it. I researched and looked into the general ways to resolve it and no avail but Px functions fine and all components and the overall system is doing good just at times here and there BSD pops up either when idle, waking up from sleep or exiting a game. Things I have tried. Windows Restore. Registry sfc scan and DCI scan (no issues). Drivers upgrade/dowgrade (No effect on fps but better graphics and game experience in general). Defrag DD . Optimize SD and DD. Delete junk, temps. Scan for malware . Clean and re-paste thermal and fans. Use various programs to speed up the computer. Disable a bunch of most common services logging up memory and performanceChanged power plan settings, modes and used this thing that helps you further modify it. Use turbo boost and overclock. Under-volt and lower clock speed of the cpu (throttle stop)Use stand by ram cleaner (ISL). Clear real time ram (current things using my ram in the background)Disable start up apps. Disable useless windows apps and settings like cortanaRegistry edit for performance boost. Uninstall and reinstall drivers clean Upgrade the IOS from windows update (BSD) then recovered. Tweaked nvidia control panel. Un-parked cores. Used manufacturer health scans and updates etc. Updated all peripheral necessary applications such as direct, C++, . NETframework. Re configured all windows services and disable useless ones (carefully). Scream internally. I am really not sure what else to do and I haven't owned a gaming laptop before and I am just confused about these issues. any help is appreciated! . EDIT: Dump files.  Hello all,. For the last couple of weeks, my 8 years old lenovo laptop (still in good shape), has been asking for a windows reboot , every time i start it up. i think this problem started due to me often falling asleep while watching some series, without the charger being plugged in, so there was often a sudden shutdown due to power shortage. in the past, there would be no issue. Just a slow start up, now it's asking for a reboot. even when i've shut the laptop down properly. I can usually fix the problem by tampering with it for half an hour but i really have no idea what im doing at said moment. i continuously try all the presented options, try to use the F8 strategy (it doesnt work most of the times) . It only works after turning the pc off and on again and again. All of a sudden, the problem is fixed but i dont know why. Losing half an hour each time is really maddening and i'd really like to be able to fix this problem. can someone explain this monk what he should do to fix this? . , i know its an old laptop but it runs fine and im rather attached to it. the only games i play, are rather old ones as i dont have the time for proper gaming. i was looking into upgrading it from 8Gb to 16 Gt and upgrading the SD (some tech place said they could do this). Already looking into getting a external hard drive so i can temper with the laptop without losing important stuff.  Watched a tutorial on how to fix and did the System Restore thing but now I'm stuck a page, tried to save and restart but it just keeps returning back to that page even when i set things to default, not sure how to fix it.  actually the problem is a different one from usual keyboard errors solutions in you tube, this one is different, you cant type and instead perform unwanted functions, not just simply type, so the solution? . The solution are two, the first consists of just typing the windows key, which makes sense because the functions are functions done with for eg. windows key + S will open settings, which means that windows key was stuck, and need to pressed again, the second is restart your computer, NOW THIS SHOULD WORK OTHERWISE NOTHING MIGHT WORK.  hey, I'm trying to configure the technicolor da2232 to be a repeater. does anybody know if this is possible and if so, how to do it?  Hi guys, I need your help. For the last few days i have this problem (double mouse or whatever, this white cursor behind my cursor, i ray dont know how to describe it) and i can't fix it. I updated my drivers, I even restored nvidia settings back to default, but i can't get rid of really annoying.  So i recently just got my new pc and whenever im using it it wont detect any headphones ive tried multiple headset and it wont even act like its inside of the computer ive checked playback and i dont see it there ive checked drivers and i dont see it there. Ive looked up countless youtube videos and im still struggling to find a solution please help.  Doubts about the PU in the task manager. Every time you close a non-Windows program, the PU fires up to 100% for a second. It happens to me with browsers, games and other programs like the Wallpaper Engine. I tried using other programs to measure PU peaks, but the results were different. When doing the procedure in the Si center it went down to 1% when the task manager showed me 100% spikes. Others, like Windows Xbox Game Bar, showed no change. I've been doing some research on the subject, and what little information I found was contradictory. Some said it was normal and others that it was a mistake that needed to be treated. That's why I'm here on this subreddit even though my English is very bad. I had to request Google translate to write some words. I hope you can solve my doubts. Thanks.  so, pc is working fine if not playing games, while playing it keeps crashing and says make sure ur gpu drivers are up to date, (they are) . sometimes that causes pc crash and have blue and black screen errors. rn pc is working fine but i am scared to launch the games , us if blue or black screen errors comes out i need to reinstall windows again.

Hi , I have a question about CPUs. Because many CPUs can run same tasks with same speed as others but at lower frequency, how do I know that laptop I've chosen had good CPU and was better option than any other laptop? . I'm looking for something capable of early running Adobe Illustrator for example or some steam games. For an instance - how do I know 1. 8 Gh with boost 4. 3 is or isn't better than 2. 3 gh with boost to 3. 6gh ? . Since there is this problem about the same speed at lower frequency. Say for my english , it is not my birth language. Thank you for any help.  Had my Motorola G50 for about half a year or so now, just started having an issue across apps. Whenever I try to send a picture, I'll select the image I want to send, but then it sends a different image instead. For example, I'd be messaging someone, press the button to attach or send a photo in whatever app I was using, the gallery would open, I'd tap on a picture of a cat in the gallery, then the image would enlarge to show a picture of a plant instead of the image I'd selected. If I look at my gallery in Google photos, it's fine, I tap on an image, and it shows me the correct image. Any way to get rid of this issue? . Tried clearing cache in apps and in Google photos, but no success. Thanks in advance.  Whenever I press caps lock it tabs me out of my game. It can be frustrating when trying to type. It just started happening out of no where so I dont know what to do.  My teacher has . doc files that we, his students, can download. They're meant to be printed because he's strictly paper, but I used one to type on until I could get a paper from him. I did the whole assignment, exited out of google docks, and when I came back it was the blank format again with no work done. I checked document history and it was no help. Can I get my work back or is it gone?  Don't know if this will help anybody but I was having all the issues that the X360 users report. Primarily it would lock up every few minutes. I'm a little more advanced user than most and started utilizing some tools and dumps to see what was going on. Upon investigation I realized something was basically stopping Windows from working. I began to wonder what could be causing this. When I viewed the event log I was logging approx 1000 events a day within just a short period of time with the laptop on most of them being critical exceptions. Everything from security, software and administrative events. Trust me I've done all the suggested stuff all the way to fresh install. I got to thinking what I would have done when I worked in tech support. So I began going through all these logs and realized everything was being stopped from operating and executing. Only one thing I know of that does that and its security software. So I disabled my 3rd party firewall and enabled windows firewall and all is resolved. Not a single crash or exception in the event logs. Crazy. It seems that this may be a Windows issue and that they're are getting to a point where we have to rely on them for our security software.  . hi - so this is basically my first time for asking for help on reddit. So I have an old phone, a Samsung galaxy S7 - not the bomb version. So a few years ago my dad smashed it on the ground, and it got the screen of which basically mean the CD liquid in the screen panel went all over the screen. I'm not too sure exactly but basically the screen does not work A ALL. the phone itself is fine, and I am wondering how can I access it? What I'm trying to do is connect it to a Px and screen mirror it so I can access it through my Px. There is a problem though - I cant press the Px to see phone So, I was wondering how could I get over this debugging issue, and just plug it in my Px and able to access its files. also Ns resisting it. There no point to that. Also, the screen mirroring app I was gonna use was . So does anyone know how I could potentially fix this? Also I'm running windows 11. Also all i want to do is able to access the phone itself. I don't care about the actual phone just whats on it, like media, photos and data in apps. Oh and also the buttons are basically done for. they don't work. if anyone needs any more information about this, please ask. So in conclusion, I need to know how to get connect the phones files to my Px and be able to transfer files without being able to accept the little notification staying Px to see cause the screen is broken. And if anyone has any ideas how to screen mirror or whatever or a better idea would be really appreciated.  Hello,. I recently added 8gb more AM to my Asks UF gaming a15 laptop and it was working fine at first, then progressively I noticed that it was (and is) getting slower. The ram that I added was a Crucial 8Gt Dr4-3200 SODIMM T8G4FRA32A. My old AM is a 8Gt Dr4-3200 Micro 8TF1G64Z-32G2J1. My IOS is up-to-date. I removed the new AM and the speed went back to normal. Might it just be a faulty AM card? Should I get it replaced? . thanks.  Hello. I have been having this issue for a while, where my desktop pc has terrible, jittery connection that makes it impossible to play games without disconnecting or lagging. My laptop, on the other hand, is perfectly fine. So is my phone. I tried resting the network settings, updating drivers, and I've even reset the Px to factory settings. I have no idea what else I can try. I am using windows 10 on the Px and laptop, and I'm on the same connection. I am also in a college, so I don't have access to the router. Ethernet doesn't work either, so thats off the table.  I recently have been experiencing issues with my power supply and I was wondering if I could replace the current one I have which is the EVA Gt 1000W 80 Plus Gold Semi Modular with the same one and just keep the cables of the old one because changing them would be a hassle, would it be okay here? Ive heard people frying everything when keeping the wires but is it okay in this context?  Before I start, yes, I have cleared the cache of every single app on my phone, and yes, I have deleted all the files in my trash bin. I have a Samsung Galaxy A11, and . I have almost no space available and my phone is starting to slow down because of it. The weirdest thing is, as you can see in that screenshot, all those files together don't even take up 1Gt of space, yet out of my 64 Gt of storage, I only have 174B available. What's even weirder is that when I tap on Whereas in the previous screenshot it says my photos and videos only take up 900B of space, this second screenshot says they take up almost 40Gt. And I don't know why. I only have like 20 photos, 5 short videos, and 500 screenshots in my gallery. I refuse to believe that's what's taking so much space. Heck, I just tried moving all my screenshots to my Px to free up some space, but it barely made any difference. And as I said, my trash bin is empty. So what could be taking up so much space on my phone? Any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Using the function on my phone, this is what I get: . So basically, is taking up 60Gt+ of space, but I don't know what could be.  I have a home network with average WII speed of 200 Maps. Internet speed is fine but speed to read or write from AS is super slow. Topology below:. 1. Internet comes to Virgin UB 3 modem. 2. From Hub cable goes to To-Link A5400 router. 3. From Hub cable goes to AS (network storage). 4. Laptop uses Wiki from the router to connect to AS. 5. Speed between AS and Wiki is very slow (copy file is 2Maps). I bought To-Link A5400 to increase WII coverage and being able to access AS when provider is down. The issue was network cable. I have swapped it and connection looks good.  So i have this one app and sometimes it opens normally but also sometimes it almost takes 3 seconds before it actually open like when i click on it it would just stay on the homescreen for couple of seconds before it actually open its the only app that does that and it's getting annoying.  Any help is appreciated.  Hello everybody . I have been experiencing framedrops for no apparent reason. While i play a game, or am using the computer at all, the computer just shutters randomly. this has been going on for a week or so. This is the latencymon , showing the latency. I already tried installing latest drivers, older (less latency-prone) drivers, virus scan, rebooting. I just dont know what to do at this point.  So Please Help me get my keyboard back.  Hi all, having a strange issue with updating my setup: My desktop Px has a 3060ti, normally connected to 2 monitors (2k165hz a 1080p60hz). In the past I also had it connected via 15m hdi cable to a 1080p tv in another room, for playing games on the couch. I have since upgraded that To to a Hisense U7G55 4k screen, and so updated the hdi cable to a 15m, 4k60 rated amplified cable running from my pc to the new To. My pc detects the tv fine, knows the brand, recommended resolution etc. According to display panel, it is connected, I can even move my mouse and windows off the monitor it. HOWEVER the tv displays if the pc is outputting in anything higher than 1080p. What I've done so far: . cables are mono-directional. Triple checked that. every other screen except tv . are up to date . and removed old drivers . multiple ports on tv and gpu . both pc and tv . that all of the To's ports are definitely 4k60 rated (2. 1) . (One Px4) and both my partner's Px's (Win11/MD570, Win10/TX1070) work fine in 4k60 via the same hdi cable to the screen . windows . Regardless, it will always appear in nvidia windows display settings (on my monitor) with whatever resolution I set, but will display on the tv unless it is in 1080p, and no higher than 60hz. Hopefully someone can help me with this obscure issue, I've yet to find a solution online and I'm starting to go crazy haha 3 . Running Windows 11, CPU R5 3600, PU 3060ti, AM 2x16gb DR4, MSI370.  Hi guys,. I'm using a PS from Eaton, it can provide 660watts. Connected to the PS is my gaming pc with 650watts SU + monitor (about 40watts). My question is -. The Eaton PS got a very loud fan, it's on while the PS runs on battery or when the battery is charging. So of the time the PS is silent and Im ok with it. However, lately I've found that when the pc is stretched to the limit (while playing a very demanding video game), the PS fan will start for a few seconds and then stop, every now and then while playing the game. So does it mean that the PS is faulty, or is it ok for the fan to start a little while under heavy load? Or is a 660was PS isn't enough or my needs?  This is the second time this has happened. I boot my Px and it gives me a GA light. SI Gaming Z Trio TX 3080. Drivers are updated. I fixed it last time by putting in another PU and updating the drivers but I put in the other PU and still getting a GA light. This is so frustrating. I need literally any and all tips to fix this. Ive unplugged everything except cpu one ram and PU. It booted into the bios. I put my boot drive (M. 2) in and now the PU isnt being detected.  TI video card, 3 monitors, most settings are likely still set as default. When I try to slowly move the mouse from one screen to the other, it gets stuck at the edge of the screen. I really need to whip the mouse in one particular direction or another for it to travel between screens. Is there any way to disable or adjust this mouse behavior when moving between monitors?  I keep receiving weird messages on my phone like 092f093e and so on. Is there anything I should be worried about and/or how to prevent this?  Ive had my pc for about a year now and I've never had any temperature issues until now. Recently my CPU has been thermal throttling and sitting idle in windows at 85c. Today it full shut off to bios four times while I was trouble shooting it, I have no idea why but in bios the temps are usually around 41-43c but in windows at 5% usage it's at 85c. What could be causing this? . I have an i9-10850k and a thermaltake AI, and ES I have checked if it was dust and from what I can see there is no noticeable closing of the AI.  Hello everyone, I'm going to buy a Crucial X500, 500Gt and use it as an external SD with either of these two enclosure:. Since I'm going to use that SD as an external drive using of one these enclosure, in just wondering if it would be possible to upgrade the firmware of the SD? :).  I can browse the internet just fine and download and upload speeds are normal, however whenever trying to launch Valorant and numerous games on steam I am unable to connect to servers. There are a few games that work however most games have loading issues and are unable to connect entirely. Does anyone know what may be causing this? I have reset all browsers to default and tried turning off firewall and I am getting no results. Please help :(.  i don't even use the launcher . is it using my pc even with im not in it ? . is there a way to block it ?  I've had this laptop for about 15 months now, and from the very beginning I installed a secondary SD which I've had no issues with up until now. I mostly use this drive to store data, movies, some games, etc. Occasionally, when I boot up my laptop, the secondary SD still appears in File Explorer and I can access it. However, 80% of the time, it doesn't show up in File Explorer, Disk Management, or Device Manager. Because it's not showing up anywhere, I'm unsure of how to diagnose the issue. I haven't tried opening up my laptop and checking the part yet, but if it's still recognizable and accessible 20% of the time, it must still be functional to some degree. I'm using an Eluktronics MCH 15 G3 Laptop running Windows 10 Home. The drive in question is a PG X8100 PCIe Gen3x4 M. 2 2280 1To SD. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.  I recently updated my driver for my x 670 and now my screen has green and purple lines flashing across it, i tried rolling back the driver version, reinstalling older drivers, footer into safe mode and deleted the drivers, tried all ports on the gpu and different cables and a different monitor, i updated my motherboard bios, changed power supply, but my pc is stuck bootlooping and if it does boot it has green and purple lines flashing across the screen and the resolution is stuck at 800 by 600. I dont have the money to shell out for a new gpu, any help would be appreciated.  I've encountered a strange problem where the copy and paste shortcuts stopped working, This can be fixed easily with a restart but currently im in a position where that is not viable. Is there any other fixes for it? It was literally working 5 minutes ago but as I went to copy 1 more piece of text it stopped copying. It's not even the shortcut thats broken, if I try copying something using a button like google translates copy feature, that wouldnt work either. Running Windows 10, trust me, my keyboard isnt the issue, All keys are registering properly, including Ctrl and C+v combined.  So today when i decided to open device manager one of my threads was empty, no idea why . I have satisfactory opened in background if it helps . Link to image: . Its only visual bug or some serious thing?  My friends m. 2 drive started failing and then windows boot manager corrupted. He then gave me the m. 2 drive and I did a full backup of it via Linux. I then installed a new windows install for him. How can I copy his old data and put it on the Fresh install.  I'm using Windows 10. I've recently got a second monitor for my system for the first time and am still getting used to it. One problem I have with it though is that often times the whole program wouldn't move to my second monitor when I send the program to it. If I move Photoshop to second monitor for example, the program itself will move to the second monitor no problem but every other things I open in it will stay on the first monitor until I move that window too. If I try to create a new file, the window for creating that new file will pop up in the first monitor. If I try using color picked, that window will pop up in the first monitor. After I assign the new windows to the second monitor it pops up in the right place, but when I thought that I've moved every windows that I'll ever use in Photoshop I find a new one every day. And what if one day I want to use Photoshop on my first monitor again? Do I migrate every windows to my first monitor again? . It's not only Photoshop, and I've been doing similar things to each and every program that I want to use in the second monitor, and it's weighing on me. Is there any way to fix the whole part of a program to open in a certain monitor?  Im a bit confused about something. Ive been using two-factor authentication for a while now on all my important services after one of my accounts got hacked last year, and the type I prefer to use is the text message version of it. Recently I saw a video from a channel I respect (SomeOrdinaryGamers) that said that this is a very risky type of 2A to use, since its very if your IM card gets hijacked. But isnt that a bit like planning on getting in a car accident AND struck by lightning on the same trip home? Not only would someone need to hack whatever service youre using and get a hold of your password, but they also have to go through the Herculean (and very risky) process both figuring out who the random person whose password they got is, but also of convincing your phone provider that theyre you and getting them to send a new IM card, which is something pretty much all mobile providers (in Canada at least) take great lens to prevent. So this just seems extraordinarily unlikely to me. Sure its possible, but like I said, it seems to me a little bit like expecting to get in an accident and then get struck by lightning. Possible, but not something you have any real reason to lose any sleep about. On the contrary though, using an App-based 2A is risky in its own way, as Ive learned the hard way, since if whatever device you have the app on gets broken or needs to be reset, you wont be able to access any of the services until you contact them and have them disable the 2A, which is a massive pain. Like, am I overlooking something here?  I've made a OpenVPN Access Server in Ubuntu 20. 04 M instance in Oracle Cloud instead of readymade OpenVPN Access Server in marketplace. I can't access it's Web I. If anyone knows a workaround please help.  Im Having an issue with my windows 11 , there is English Up language , English - international and another english Up with english Up keyboard! , How do i remove those english languages and keep only one? i tried time and language language and region, there is only arabic and one english only (Up) and its not removable by anyway.  It happened suddenly three years ago and I'm still holding onto it with just that one string of hope. It doesn't appear anywhere, literally having it plugged and unplugged is the exact same. All I find are solutions that involves it being detected. Opened it, all parts and connectors look a-Of and I took macro pictures of it but I can't seem to post them here. Shall I finally give up and throw it, or do you have suggestions? . Thanks in advance.  I've had this problem for almost a week so far and wasn't able to fix it. My laptops screen brightness hasn't been able to work. I can adjust the slider and use the fn keys, but it doesn't change the brightness at all. The problem just started all of a sudden while I was updating a few things off steam. I tried updating drivers, uninstalling stuff and even factory resetting and nothing. My laptop is an acre nitro 5 A-515-45-R9Q on windows 10 with a Ryzen 9 5900X with Radeon Graphics and a Nvidia TX 3080 if any of that helps. Any advice is graciously appreciated.  In file explorer I miss clicked on something that for a split second said and now when I go into my downloads all my files are arranged in two columns and the files are big squares with the file name under them instead of them all being in a singular column. image files now show the image before clicking on them. Before it used to be like a bunch of thin rectangles stacked on top of each other with the file/folder name being on the left side with the creation date and type of file being on the right and now its like two columns of boxes with the boxes showing the image file's picture or a symbol like a folder with the file name being at the bottom of the box. How can I undo this? I can provide an image in the post if I can figure out how.  So I've had this Px for just about a year now and after the first few weeks it started blue screening and almost every game I play crashes out of nowhere, I've had countless blue screens over the year now and I'm still not sure what the problem may be. If anyone could tell me what to do or where to start would be greatly appreciated And if anything needs to be uploaded please do let me know . Thanks!  I have a moto stylus, and it's been long overdue for an update. It finally updated and now everything is different which is a problem for me but it can't be helped. However, VERY picture I had that wasn't taken on the main camera is gone. Screenshots, downloads, videos and pictures from snap, things people sent me everything is gone and this includes things I had in my S card. I'm a very sentimental person and have been crying over this for a while because some of those pictures are of people I definitely can't remake with or can't contact for a copy and it genuinely is fucking with me so badly. Is there a way to restore these? I wish I could just undo the update completely because literally everything down to how to screenshot and how to change tabs is different and it's breaking me out but the pictures and videos are my biggest concern. Losing them is perhaps my biggest fear and now I'm incredibly distressed. Is there anything I can do at all to recover them and to stop it from happening next time?  So I bought the W My Cloud Ex2 Ultra (I really regret the purchase but by the time I did anything to the AS I was unable to return it). The stock fan was so loud that you could hear it over movies. This made me decide to want to swap out the fan. I decided to take the stock fan and replace it with the Noctua Ns-A4x10. Ever since I did a fan swap, even if the fan was working at its max speed, it would still give me a notification that the fan failed and the device was overheating. I would go to check the device, once the notification on my phone would show up, and it would be at a normal temp, but the fan would show 0. Although, I would check and the fan would be spinning. Is there another fan I should be using that wouldn't cause this issue? Kinda frustrated that Western Digital doesn't like 3rd party or even quieter fans. Edit: Not trying to ask really for recommendations on hardware parts, as per the rules, more of a what does W like to work with.  Hello guys, i'm using windows 10 and all apps are sharper and look better in full screen mode (for example the browser) but blurry in widowed mode. it doesn't look so bad but is there any way to make it sharp? . and btw i have the windows fix blurry option enabled. Thanks!  So I'm currently using a mid-range fibre plan from my local SP. When the internet works, it's fairly fast, nothing spectacular but generally I can load He videos without suffering most of the time. But with working from home I've been having to do a lot of voice and video conferencing and that's kind of where I started noticing issues. Incoming audio and video are always uninterrupted, but outgoing audio and video is always interrupted. It happens about every minute or so and lasts for 3-5 seconds where my face freezes, and I lose about the same amount of time in audio. For the receiver's POV it often sounds like so the plan with this project is. and how we're going to achieve . So basically I get random outages that is felt specifically on tiktok/reels/short video content, video games, conference calls, basically stuff that can't just pre-load. It happens on all devices so it's not a hardware issue (or it might be if it's the router). It didn't used to be like this upon installation, internet was fine for about 4 months but I've been facing this issue for about 6 months now. I spoke to my SP and they said there are no service disruptions where I am, suggested I upgraded my package for more bandwidth (only 2 people live in this house and my mum just watches k-dramas 2 hours out of her day), and claimed that if I wanted someone to come in and look at it, I would be charged a fee so I figured I would ask here first. Any clues to what this might be?  Hi, sorry for the potentially dumb question. I just got a pc setup going with two monitors. Right now my speakers are plugged into my Px. I want to plug my switch into one of the monitors as well as my Px, no problem there except for sound i would think. Is there a splitter cord that would allow me to have my headphones go both into the pc and the monitor? or should I get another set of speakers for the monitor when i have my switch plugged in? . any responses would be appreciated, maybe theres a solution i'm missing that you could make me savvy to. Much love! thanks.  Was on my computer early today when it randomly BSODd. I waited for it to diagnose the issue and it began the restart. After trying to reboot it BSD again with the error AD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO. I was able to boot it into windows recovery mode but it wouldnt let me do anything. Every option such as repair start up or factory reset without losing files would just give me an error and would not execute. After this I tried rebooting one more time and now I get nothing but the logo screen (says ASROCK with no loading screen). I can load up the bios setting and the only boot option I have is Windows Boot Manager. Choosing this does absolutely nothing. It restart the computer and brings me right back to the ASROCK screen and just sits there. I cannot get back to the windows recovery boot up and im honestly lost on what to do. I feel my only option is to redownload windows through SB? I thought for a second it was my DD that was corrupted but I can see it in my IOS settings so im not sure. Any help?  So i don't know what happened, But when I booted up my Px once all of the font In the browser, Programs, and even in setting was pixelated and it was looking janky, I tried to look for tutorials online but none of them worked cause I was on Win11. I can't Upload images on imgur because i cant register in my country apparently.  I changed my Windows 11 laptops C:/username through an administrator account and now when I try to login in back to by account it says it gets stuck on Screen. After sometime it login in back to the administrator account and shows a message that it cannot sign in to the account. Please help me. I don't want to mess this laptop up.  My hp probook 4540s occasionally fails to boot and displays the boot device not found message. After removing and reinserting the hard drive it boots up normally. Is the error caused by a faulty had or the laptop?  I have a two story house with concrete walls. My SP modem/router is one device and is plugged into an Ethernet (I think that's what it's called-looks like a phone jack) port in the wall. The wifi is perfect on this floor, where my tv is located, so streaming is not a problem. I also have two more ethernet ports/jacks upstairs in two of the bedrooms. The tv in the bedroom cannot stream at all because the signal isn't strong enough- I assume because of the concrete walls and floor. HOWEVER, when I move the modem/router and plug it into one of the bedroom ports/jacks, the tv works great there but I loose streaming downstairs. Moving the modem/router is easy. I've tried to find a central spot in the house where the cables? from the ethernet ports/jacks merge but I can't find anything. There is no basement or attic. My question is: . Can I purchase another router Of modem (which would be best? ), plug it in to an unused ethernet port/jack on the other floor and connect it to the main modem/router provided by my SP so I can stream on both floors? Would I need a modem or a router? How can I set it up so they to each other? . I am not at all tech savvy so please, answer in plain English, no acronyms as I do not understand what those letters mean! . I really hope someone can help me as it is driving me crazy.  Hello i am thinking about buying the new IPad air, so i wanna know if i can use minitab on it and if i Is there any relevant apps i can use instead of minitab and it's compatible with m1 and can run it on IPad? . Thanks in advance.  Okay I don't really know where to go with this question to here I am. Basically I use my laptop for literally everything, whether it's my classwork, my job, or anything else. I've ALWAYS used an ethernet connection as our internet here is completely unusable without it. I used it for about two years with no issues, moved out to go to college, came back, and suddenly I get this issue anytime I try to use it. Now I tried all of these troubleshoot methods from all these sites and sources, and the ONLY thing I got to work was to run a bunch of commands in my Command Prompt. Commands like ipconfig /release, ipconfig /renew, and nets winsock reset, nets int ip reset. Now this actually worked miraculously! I was absolutely fine, but then another issue NOBODY in the house could connect to our wifi. Literally nothing that wasn't plugged in directly (via ethernet) could connect. I had to go through an entire process to call our provider, reset all this stuff, and eventually we got everything working again, but my computer went right back to the issue. So seemingly the only thing that fixed my issue created this entire dilemma for everyone else in the house. I'm no internet or tech aficionado, but should this even happen? How did fixing this issue on my computer BREAK the wifi in the entire house? I just don't understand how this happened, and am now left with a basically useless computer that cannot connect to the internet at all. If anyone has any advice, or reassurance as to how I could resolve this, I would appreciate it a ton. This is a short term issue now as I'm only here for a week, but come summer when I'm here for a few months, I (as sad as it is) cannot live with this issue for that long.  Hello everyone,. I am a windows user but Id like to dual boot in to Linux. I understand the basics, at least I think I do. Peel away a slice of the hard drive and create a new partition, and then install the Of on the new partition. Enable the dual boot ability in the bios if necessary, etc. The way Ive been booking in to Linux previously is off of a flash drive. It just kind of annoying to have to press F keys and try to catch the bios before it boots in to windows. What Id really like is a I to automatically launch when the computer turns on, and ask me which partition (or device) I want to boot in to without me having to prompt it. If it would give me the option to also boot from a removable device that would be even better. I know this sort of general I exists I just have no idea how to set it up or which one to use. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.  As the title says dam. exe is at high usage with roughly 3500000 KB commit and 1000000 Kb working set according to resource monitor. This comes pretty much right after i downloaded a zip that windows notified me had offercore and was removed. I didnt see the zip in the recycle bin or in my downloads but i assume windows did it for me. I never opened the zip so i should be fine but the timing worries me. Any thoughts or experience? Help is greatly appreciated.  Hi I am having GB issue with my keyboard, its not from hardware its the software. After booking the pc, my keyboards Lighting effects automatically changes to ED.

It might be more prone to do it during intensive stuff like gaming, but it happens plenty outside of that too. The screen will usually freeze, audio goes silent, before crashing after a few seconds. It'll boot back up like a normal boot up, no blue screen. Sometimes it will freeze but not crash, though that tends to be rare. I've tried checking to see if my memory was corrupted, if my boot drive wasn't plugged in well, ran CHKDSK, and tried to watch for any spikes in usage around the freezing/crashing, but so far, nothing came up wrong. This started happening after I installed a new wifi card for my Px, along with testing out an old SD I found. The SD ending up being slow, so I got rid of it as I thought it might be the cause of the crashing, but it still persists. Specs:. PU - MD Ryzen 5 3600. CPU - Radeon X 570. Motherboard - ASRock Ab350 Pro4. Ram - 16 gigs, don't remember the type. Running Windows 10. Any help or advice is appreciated.  For context, I'm in a psychiatric hospital built 6 years ago that has wifi access (but it's unsurprisingly spotty for video calls, especially when your room is through several walls). My tablet is definitely less than ideal, overhears and has crap wifi. A family member unexpectedly but also thoughtfully dropped off my desktop computer, complete with monitor, keyboard, and cables. The motherboard does not have wifi. I tried plugging into the ethernet port, and hey-ho, no internet. After 2 days of asking questions and ringing around, the maintenance guy saying it wasn't his job, one of the nurses finally spoke to the In team. The In team said that the ethernet ports (of which there are 2 in all 50+ bedrooms, and who knows how many more in the common areas, conference rooms, and offices) are not connected because is less secure and can be That is what they told the nurse on staff, from the employed, professional In team. I like to think I'm a smart person and I'm interested when something doesn't make sense. This doesn't make sense. Do I call bullshit on the In team? Is it something that might have been lost in translation between then nurses and In? . I wouldn't be surprised if it was as something as simple as them ordering all the wall plates originally, and then deciding that running all the ethernet was too expensive. That's also a thin excuse because there's 2 functioning coaxial ports on each of those same wall plates. Running 1 ethernet cable for them wouldn't have been that much more expensive right? . Is there any credibility to this concern?  Title says it all. Not sure what else to add. Thanks again!  Hey, on windows 10. I've had the laptop i'm using now with 3 years, and only I use it. Today, went to magnet link a file into my bit torrent, but it wouldn't load. Clicked the bittorrent shortcut and it said it no longer works. Weird. So I go to download bit torrent and it keeps failing, saying . I link it, but it says it can't go in my downloads, so I save to user. From there, it says I don't have permission. What's going on? Feels very weird that this has happened - as I say, only I use this machine. Also noticed 2 files I downloaded through bit torrent a month ago were showing as in my downloads page, despite not touching them in weeks. Any ideas?  I upgraded to Windows 11, for Winzipped files with Japanese character names, the file names are gabled when I send the tipped file to other people. They look fine on my machine. I looked all over the Internet and cannot find anybody who has had this happen. It was a pain to upgrade and I am lathe to downgraded back to Windows 10. Anybody out there had this problem?  Downloaded automation studio on my laptop and i think i accidentally downloaded the files to my home screen now its covered. Anyone know how i would go about clearing it off? . edit . Thank you all for the help the situation is resolved.  My Lenovo laptop restart automatically every now and then and it keeps taking my tabs out that I have saved (for times sake), so its a hassle to go back and try to remember the tabs I kept opened. Is there a way for me to manually restore my tabs? . EDIT I SOLVED In SORRY OR BOTHERING YOU GUY!  Specs: . Ryzen 5 3600 at 4200 mhz. 3070 Km. 32gb ram at 3600 mhz. 1tb sata ssd. My issue is that when certain games (currently Mortal Shell - downloaded through xbox gamepass on the xbox app) are in focus, my cpu and gpu usage will drop to below 30% and fluctuated between 1-30% seemingly indefinitely-- until I tab out of the game. Because of the low usage, my temps go way low because they are not being used, and i get less than 10 fps. all until I tab out of the game, when i tab out of the game, my computer returns to completely normal and my gpu and cpu usage go back to what they would be if they game was running properly, and then when I tab back into the game, it all happens again. I also found that with this, whether it's the cause or the effect, msi afterburners shows that my cpu and gpu power both drop to below 50 watts. PLEASE HELP M. I have current drivers all installed-- and I am running windows 11 however this issue has occurred also before I went to windows 11.  Hi, I own a He 15-eq2070au and have decent specs. When it is unplugged, the games I play run smoothly. However, when I plug it in with the charger, it has lag spikes or shutters every 10-20 seconds which makes it unplayable. What causes this problem? I doubt it is not thermal throttling because I have a laptop cooler and elevated my laptop so that it has space under it and I see a 20 degrees drop ever since I started using it so my laptop doesn't really overhead. I am sure there's no software issue either because I resented my laptop recently. I also have messed around with my power plan settings and there was little to no change. I am starting to wonder if my laptop charger is the problem because it is 45W. Is 45W just not suitable for gaming and that I should get a new charger with a higher wattage? Any thoughts?  So, like the elongated title says, my C: drive on a 250Gt SD has been completely full for months. I have no memory of when it started or how it happened. I really don't use this laptop often but my workstation is being repaired and although it's a great laptop, this SD storage thing is a maddening puzzle. Again, WinDirStat and that software or whatever - neither of them found anything irregular. Just my user account taking up 24gb. That was the biggest file it found. I've deleted every program file that isn't part of the Of and uninstalled everything all the way down to Google Earth. Note. SD suffering in the red with to spare. It's probably malware of some sort but I don't have the time to chase it down. it. I have barely anything on this laptop and I'm tired of troubleshooting. How do I just totally reset it without losing my Windows license? I'm fine with losing my user account, etc. Please let me know what I can do to just wipe the slate and get my laptop back to normal, factory reset style. I'm tired. Thanks a bunch! ( :.

Hello everybody! . I was wondering if it's possible or if anyone knows a way to hook up my work laptop to my personal computer in a way that displays the work laptop in an application window on the Px? Kinda like how a vm would look like. Peripheral (ie. keyboard/ mouse/ mic) are not an issue as I intend to hook up a set to the laptop itself. But it is welcome if you know a way to use the Px peripherals with the laptop without a switch. Also I'd like to avoid removing in as a solution if possible.  When I go to control centersoundthe device im usingpropertieslevelsbalance If i move one slider to change the levels it moves the other one along with it. help would be appreciated thank you in advance.  just spilled a monster through the top vent, shut it down within 30 seconds. went through with dry tissue, coffee filters with 91% alcohol, tissue with 91% alcohol, and it is sitting to dry currently. majorly affected area was my gpu, while some slipped down on top of my power supply. there was a slight smell of burning monster but otherwise there was no smoke or other signs of damage. the alcohol should rid it of any excess stickiness, and i plan to wait until tomorrow evening (currently 12am) to power it up. any other advice? very much scared. thank you.  Hi I download CPU- Z and the app says board and hardware as However, I have read online and users say if your phone ends with it means you are using exynos. I don't know who to believe lmaz. The full model name is S-S901e/ds. Anyone able to help?  Good day! im trying to install a program via cmd /user:admin i keep receiving even my local account is administrator.  I have a monitor and it's not incredibly dirty or anything but I wanted to clean it to get some of the spots and smudges off. What's the best way to do so?  Hi all, having a strange issue with updating my setup: My desktop Px has a 3060ti, normally connected to 2 monitors (2k165hz a 1080p60hz). In the past I also had it connected via 15m hdi cable to a 1080p tv in another room, for playing games on the couch. I have since upgraded that To to a Hisense U7G55 4k screen, and so updated the hdi cable to a 15m, 4k60 rated amplified cable running from my pc to the new To. My pc detects the tv fine, knows the brand, recommended resolution etc. According to display panel, it is connected, I can even move my mouse and windows off the monitor it. HOWEVER the tv displays if the pc is outputting in anything higher than 1080p. What I've done so far:. -Amplified cables are mono-directional. Triple checked that. -disconnected every other screen except tv. -drivers are up to date. -cleaned and removed old drivers. -Tried multiple ports on tv and gpu. -restarted both pc and tv . -checked that all of the To's ports are definitely 4k60 rated (2. 1) . -consoles and both my partner's Px's (MD570, TX1070) work fine in 4k60 via hdi to the screen. -reinstalled windows. Regardless, it will always appear in nvidia windows display settings (on my monitor) with whatever resolution I set, but will display on the tv unless it is in 1080p. Hopefully someone can help me with this obscure issue, I've yet to find a solution online and I'm starting to go crazy haha 3. Running Windows 11, CPU R5 3600, PU 3060ti, AM 2x16gb DR4, MSI370.  Hi, new to Px building. I've just finished putting everything together in my first build but I've run into a problem. When I turn on the Px the RB on the motherboard turns on, the hard drive starts up and when I touch the heatsink for my CPU it's hot but none of the fans are spinning and there is nothing coming up on the monitor. Here is the specs:. Ryzen 5 5600X. SI PG B550 Gaming Plus Motherboard. 2x8Gt Kingston Fury DR4 3200MHz. (Not using a PU atm). Data X8200 Pro 256Gt M. 2. Seagate Barracuda 2To DD. be quiet! PUR POWER 650W SU. I'll also give a description of what happens when I turn it on. 1. Press power putting and Motherboard RGB turn on and I can hear the hard drive start to spin. 2. The CPU debug light turns white for about 8 seconds before turning off and the GA debug light turns white and stays on. 3. Just because I'm worried about the CPU overheating I don't leave it on for more than a minute. Nothing on the monitor comes up. The fans aren't spinning. Any help would be amazing, . Cheers!  Water was spilled on my laptop and ever since it will not run. I have plugged it in and the fan wont run. The power button just flashes a few times than stops and repeats. I have taken the battery out and followed the instructions for if the power button flashes yet nothing works. The computer only flashes if it is plugged up and even flashes nm once the battery is out. Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks.  i want to put it to sleep but be able to just wake it whenever.  A few months ago, my computer would just completely shut off. Not restart, just black screen turn off. I eventually replaced my CPU to a Ryzen 5 5600X, and went from a Hard Drive To an M. 2 SD. Then I started getting BSODs. They Seemed to be page fault in non pages area and Kernel events. I used a memory checker and the memory seemed to all be working well, although I replaced it to 32gb (2x16) 3600mez Corsair AM. I also replaced my SU to a Corsair M650. I still kept getting some BSODs and instability, so I ended up using the commands to repair the registry, and all the recommended ones. I ended up fully reinstalling Windows (but keeping my Files), and eventually Fully reinstalled and reset Windows (took everything away and fresh installed it). This seemed to work, as I no longer got any blue screens or crashes of any sort. Until I finally got one that led to my computer boot looping and power cycling. I tried to enter Advanced Startup Settings, But I never could. Whenever I used a bootable SB (booted directly from it and changed boot order), I never could get any visual confirmation. I had for awhile major PU artifacing which ended with me getting a new PU, which led to me finally being able to see some errors whenever I tried to use a bootable SB or repair SB from Windows. The error said that Windows Failed to Start due to a missing file in the registry and to plug in installation media. I did, but whenever I got to the options it wouldnt let me boot into Safe Mode (It would Just restart the power cycle), and it never took me to the repair menu. Ive tried multiple USB, Ive used RUFUS, and Ive used Aoemis bootable media to no avail. My motherboard is the SI PG X570 Gaming Plus Mojo and Ive had it for a year and a half now, and Ive tried updating IOS and downgrading via flashing, but to no avail. Whenever I try to go to the next IOS up, it fails to update or flash, whenever I try to go to the latest bios, it also fails, so I end up having to go back to this current IOS. At this point Im completely unsure of what to do now, or how else to fix it. Ive changed power cables, DMI/DisplayPort cables, and the Motherboard Bios seems completely fine. When I check temperatures within the IOS, everything is at a normal temperature. I double checked to make sure all the cables were properly working. It just seems like in the middle of Windows repairing itself or loading, the screen goes black and the Px just restart (unsure if its just part of the boot loop, or if this is a power cycling problem). I can also see the Mobs Logo while it reboot. I Used the M. 2 SD checker and it verified there were no issues with the M. 2 Drive. Before I had checked the memory and there were no issues (Ive also tried booking with only one stick and vice versa). I was also able to use Mem Test and it worked fine. The mob detects the CPU just fine. Im honestly not sure what else is missing at this point.  Device was working fine on Saturday. Had the laptop around 2 years. No issues at all apart from low performance when opening multiple apps. Yesterday the Disk was at 100% constantly with no apparent reasons why. I use the laptop for work and for downloading films sure I'm pretty careful with what I torrent i. e. always use trusted downloads. ). I stopped superfetch after the 100% disk usage happened and the laptop began to work as fast as it ever had. I thought problem fixed. Then around an hour later it reverted to being extremely slow. I turned the laptop off and then received the Bootable . I have just this second managed to open up the startup repair application. I cannot system restore. Any advice?  This is an update to my previous post where I was getting an error stating that my device could not display protected content. I had tried almost everyday since that post something or another but nothing ever worked. But today I decided to re-install windows with the option to keep my settings and apps due to a different bug that I was having in the settings option that I still haven't been able to fix. Well after completing the installation, I noticed some things in the network section on the file explorer were changed. I'm not sure what as I had changed a bunch of things just for the heck of it thinking it would provide extra security. I also downgraded from windows 10 enterprise to pro, though I tried doing the wireless connecting then but it didn't work. So it was obviously the re-install that probably fixed some corrupted files or reset some network settings. So if you are getting the message available, no on the dxdiag file and also get HDCP capable on NVIDIA control panel then this fix would most likely also work for you.  hey guys, i have a problem. i own a notebook that has a default 200gb ssd, so i bought an external 1tb disk. the thing is, can i make the external disk the default one so everything downloads and installs automatically there but still boot windows on my ssd? . i know there is kinda an option on windows 10 to do something like this, but for me, it wont work. thank you so much to everyone that try to help! . pd: ssd disk is c, external disk is d.  I recently bought two m. 2 drives and cloned windows. Any apps that were on my C: drive works fine because the new drive that Windows is installed on is still labeled as C:. However, programs/apps that I had previously installed on a drive labeled D: (old drive letter), are now on the drive labeled C: (new drive), but windows still thinks they are on the old non-existent D: drive. I noticed this in the and tab in the control panel where it shows you the locations of the apps. I've run into issues with reinstalling some apps, like the corsair ice4 app. Every time I try to use the uninstaller, it says that it can't find the files because it's still looking for it on my old D: drive. Most apps I've been able to run their installer and just install it to the new location on the C: drive where it's already at, and windows will be able to recognize it correctly. However, for apps that are causing issues like this, is there a way to manually change the location that Windows tries to look for them? Sorry for the bad explanation. If anyone would like anything cleared up, I'll be happy to respond. I am on windows 11, and the old drives have already been formatted.  I've got what i think is a fairly specific issue and can't find much googling. I have a pair of knock off airpods connected to my Windows 10 (build 1909) (i know its way outdated but that's what our work computers run) . What i want to do is disable the play/pause/volume inputs from the headphones from actually doing anything in Windows. I don't care if the fix also stops this from working for other bluetooth headphones i only use the 1 pair. Hoping someone has come across this before and has some idea. Thanks.  I took everything out to clean the dust out and I accidentally bent a pin on the usb 3 header I didnt think it was that bad of a problem as its only 2 usb at the front of the case that I cant use anymore but when I turned the pc on everything lights up all the fans spin from the case fans, gpu and cpu fans. But I cant get a display on my monitors using hdi and display port. Ive tested another gpu but still the same result. The weird thing is that theres no debug lights so Im thinking that my mb is dead but any help is appreciated. Thanks. Specs. TX 3080. Ryzen 5800. 16 GI ddr4. 800 SU. X570 Strip Motherboard.  I have an Acre Aspire laptop (E5-774G), running Win 10 (most recent updates) and it consistently throws this error with my SB headset. It's only the headset, any other SB devices work fine. Steps I've tried:. Disabling/re-enabling the headset in Device Manager. Uninstalling it and reinstalling it in Device Manager. Drivers (I can't find any other/different drivers for it). Using other ports on the laptop. Asking Google, but all of the results for Code 10 aren't about this specific error and I'm stamped. All with no success. Restarting the computer does fix it temporarily, but having to restart my computer because I had to unplug my headset momentarily is driving me crazy. Is there a permanent fix for this error, to make it so plug and play is actually plug and play?  Hello I recently purchased a pre-built pc (specs below) and today had an issue when I first turned it on, and have had issues with it two other times today despite my attempts to look into. The computer has green dots upon startup, transitioning to horizontal green lines as it hits the log in screen and beyond. here is a picture of each. I was playing a computer game and the computer shut off and had this issue upon startup. I tried to stress test the gpu and this happened again about 15 seconds in. My gpu is an rt 3070 8gb, cpu is MD Ryzen 5 3600 3. 6 gh. 16gb ddr4 3200. Drivers for gpu are current and I'm running windows 10 . What do I do?  my start page on windows 10 shows 2 office apps. i want remove the old one. but on programs and feature there only one version showing. I've uninstalled the previous version but i didn't go well . I will put a screenshot in the comments.  about a week ago I got on my pc like normal and everything was working, than I went on a trip for a week and come back, turn on my pc and it blue screens saying the error Kernel Security Check Failure, after it crashed I tried turning it back on and it would start to boot up and than turned off, than repeated. So I waited around 20 minutes and than it booted up correctly but than after a while the blue screen came back on so I used this website and followed the steps and everything said it was fine until the 4th step I opened windows memory diagnostic and it said Hardware problems were detected. What could the issue be and what can I do to get my pc working again. (I have windows 10).  Hi team! I'm rocking a opp Find X3 Lite 5G. Love it, great phone. However, whenever I receive a call from a private number, my phone hangs up on them. Really frustrating as I've recently received a phone call that was disconnected from a new potential employer! Can't for the life of me figure it out. I've gone to all in call barring settings, however I get a I've turned it off/on again. Taken the sim out and put back in. Not sure what to do. Any tips please? !  I know this has been asked multiple times but I'm really worried since I really can't afford to lose or get locked out of my laptop now. Besides there's no one nearby to guide me through this. I just need some pro tips on things to look out for etc. My laptop originally came with Windows 8. 1, then I got the free upgrade to 10. Now I want to completely reset the whole thing using the option. I'll move whatever files that can be moved to an external hard drive and leave the rest since I don't have anything super important other than the system files. My laptop will reset to a blank Windows 10, not 8. Am I correct? . Do I need need my product key or digital license for the re-installation? . Are there other things that I should keep an eye on before doing this? . Thanks in advance.  Bought a used Px for cheap. Original plan was to toss old DD (you never know what it might have) get new SD, clone windows from my own personal devices into new SD, then insert cloned SD to used Px. Before I did any of that, I decided to turn it on with DD just to what was in it and make sure all specs were as stated. Well, when I did that, I noticed a lot of Em. and weird things you normally wouldn't see in a Px. They have a bunch of antivirus stuff and Malwarebytes, master tool gutter sales, bitlocker, keyboard notification, password box, a bunch of stuff i never heard of, but what worried me the most is a text document that when read it's basically a TDS rootkit removing tool. Em so id if this pc had rootkit or not, but that's scary. The point is, is swapping current DD with DD be enough? I heard rootkit can like affect bios/ motherboard I'm not sure. So would it even be safe to proceed as I originally planned? . What things can I do to basically ensure that everything will work fine? Removing ram will be good? Etc. Any suggestions are welcomed.  Windows update has installed a NVIDIA display driver and is waiting for a restart, problem is the driver they are installing is outdated than My current driver for Nvidia so I am afraid of corrupting the drivers, is there anyway of removing the update? So far most of the tutorials ive seen are about Uninstalling windows updates the have been ALREADY been installed after a restart.  Hi,. One of my students has a strange white border on her screen, seen here: . It's most visible in the lower left corner in this image, but it does actually go around the entire screen. I tried screenshotting this, but it seems it is not visible in screenshots. I am suspicious that this is a hardware or driver fault, but I can't really assist any further with that sort of thing. Is there any setting in Windows 11 that might cause something like this?  To make a long story short, my computer froze a bit (I had too much stuff running at once) and I had to restart it. Not like before then, I had changed my wallpaper and theme colors. Now when I go to Chrome, everything is really weird and not showing up correctly. I don't think it's a Chrome issue since I didn't use Chrome settings. Here's a screenshot of me googling the word Stuff:. Oh and on the topic of images, if I open an image in its own tab, it's just a huge red box for some reason, not the actual image.  I'm having trouble with some of the keys not registering as I type. The keys specifically that I have discovered having issues are the following:. W. R. U. I. They work when being typed while another key is being pressed at the same time. For example:. Holding shift and typing the keys work. Pressing keys like A, B, C (etc) with them at the same time result in both letters being typed and registering. Caps Lock being on does NOT make them work. I have reset the drivers. No change. An external keyboard works with no issues. (No changes in the Laptops Keys while the external one if plugged in). I dont have the ability to do a Power Reset and there is no pin hole under my laptop to do it either. I am running Windows 10 and have all updates to the most recent. All drivers after being reset, are also now update with no change. My laptop is an Asks RG Strip G531G. Thank you so much in advance for taking the time to even read this, it means a lot. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you have any more questions please let me know.  So tonight i got a virus on my windows 10 and it's corrupting my files after trying with windows anti-virus nothing worked and it kept going and tried Microsoft defender offline i think it didn't solve anything so i gave up and shut pc down and unplug both power and network even pressed the power button for the extra electricity in and now im going to sleep it's 6am.

I ll read everything when i wake up from my lumber peace and thx.  I've been having this issue with my new computer where whenever I play certain games, seemingly out of nowhere, the game will freeze, and then within about 5 seconds, my monitors will go black and then there's no way for me to even use my computer at all until I completely restart it by turning the entire thing off. The only games I've had this issue with so far are Portal and To2, as well as Spider-Man Web of Shadows (however it's not nearly as prominent with that game). As I said, it's very inconsistent as to when this sometimes I can play for upwards of 3 hours before it freezes and completely softlocks, or it can be as little as about 3 minutes after booking up the game. The exact same thing also happens when I try to watch an He Twitch stream on Chrome as well, and there's no pattern to that either. I posted about this issue on this sub about 3 weeks ago, but I only got one response saying it was probably a PU issue, but even after updating my graphics drivers with official software, if anything, it made the issue slightly worse. For those wondering, though, I've got an MD Radeon X Vega 7 onboard PU, so if it's typically an MD Radeon problem or something, then there we go. I'm honestly desperate for a fix to this issue, so if anyone has any kind of idea for how to fix it, then please don't hesitate to comment.  My computer will restart with no blue screen when I play games that are more gpu intense then others .  Hello .

When I use the DMI port, everything works fine. What's more confusing is that plugging in DisplayPort actually works after booking it with DMI, even with proper 1440p 165Hz support. When I boot it without any display cables connected, it also boots fine. I've tried the following:. Flushing BIOS / Reinstalling PU drivers / Changing PCIe versions in IOS.  I need to free up space on my laptop. But my files just don't add up to the space that it occupies. Can there be a duplicate data on my pc. There is 4 different user file on my C disk. I'm very confused.  A few days ago I ran into a problem where some games (seems to be just direct12 games) will freeze/run at about 1 frame every few seconds UNLESS I alt-tab to another window (e. g task manager, file explorer ect. ). Then the game will run completely normally at 60+fps until I click back on the game. This happens if the game is running in fullscreen, borderless widowed or widowed. This problem is isolated to hitman 3, forza horizon 5, cyberpunk 2077 and dying light 2 (I have tried dying light 2 with both dx11 and dx12 with no change) which as far as I can tell are all direct12 and none of my other games with different graphics apps are affected. I have downloaded the direct installer and its says my direct version is up to date. I have updated windows since this began and the problem persists (currently I am on windows 11 version 22000. 556). I have tried multiple Nvidia driver versions including the most recent (version 511. 79) with no luck. My hardware is an amd r5 3600, Nvidia rt 3060ti and 16gb ddr4 and all temperatures are within normal ranges. I have run out of ideas for diagnosing and fixing the problem so any advice would be appreciated thank you :).  Hi Reddit,. I found my old iPod touches from my childhood lying around in my house and decided to get it working again (for old times sake). Its disabled, it was from when I was 7-8. I plug one in, and it tells me to trust this Mac. I cant get a prompt to do that on the iPod itself, and I cant even get it to go into recovery mode. The other one, I could get it into recovery mode. It shows up an icon to connect to computer (like this: ) and when I do that and try to restore it, it does its thing (extracts software) but then as soon as I prompt it to restore, it says The iPod iPod could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (5). No information out there has anything about Error 5. Looking for your help, thank you!  My laptop is from the year 2015. I don't know its motherboard. Do you think it may be possible to add a PM 2. 0 module onto this laptop? Many thanks in advance!  Every time my pc has been asleep or I have shut it down, when I boot it again it won't recognize my second monitor and the graphics seem worse. Only way I have found to fix this is too install the drivers. Every single time. It's driving me crazy, any advice would be great.  I have two computers at home: a personal one, and a work one. I have a number of things I use for each of these:. Three monitors (all used by both computers). Personal uses work uses DMI. This is annoying because sometimes I'll be working on one computer and then the monitors will auto-detect the other one is on and it'll switch my inputs. Two keyboards (one for each). One for work, one for personal. One mouse. Has two different Bluetooth channels so I can connect to each of them. Two webcam (one for each). Two headset (one for each). Two ethernet cables (one for each). As you can imagine, my desk is overrun with too much stuff. Is there any hardware I can buy and plug my stuff into and then it'll just support both computers? For example, letting me easily switch my keyboard and headset between computers so that I only need to have one of each at my desk?  Not much else I can say. My forward and backwards buttons are on my keyboard and my left and right. i have bound to my mouse. whenever I try moving left and right, it stops moving either forward or backward.  My parents have a lot of maxwell HG gold 30 tapes that they want to get turned into digital. I know places like Walgreens and Sam's have these services. I actually want to buy some equipment and do it myself. What equipment would it be easier to do it with?  my laptop is an asks strip g17 Rt 2070 , I bought it a year ago and recently I feel like it isn't performing as good as it used to, so I started looking at my temperature and it was reaching 90 which never happens it usually sits around 77-80 I'm not sure what's wrong, plus the fans sound slower and quieter. is it old and I need a new one or is it a simple issue and if it is can someone tell me what is it and what should I do. if you need more info tell me, Thanks.  So I'm kinda at a loss here. This isn't my first rodeo with Win10 but I don't even really know how to describe the issue in a why that's helpful aside from just giving a play by play, so here goes. Bear with me. For a while now I'd occasionally get an issue while watching videos on YouTube, and YouTube only, where the video and audio would shutter and sorta, blend? Like it doesn't stop and start really fast it keeps playing just like it's getting chopped up, like when you talk into a fan. I chalked it up to connection issues since it only occurred while watching YouTube videos and my internet's notoriously fuss. But just now I noticed while watching a video and browsing some other tabs that the whole browser was lagging, and I thought I saw the mouse lagging as well but I couldn't tell for sure. A moment later I'm watching the video in fullscreen and the choppy lag thing occurs but this time it doesn't stop. The mouse starts clearly lagging and eventually the whole computer grind to a vault. I can't LT+AB, IN+AB or CRL+LT+EL. The screen fades, like it does when the window stops working, and the cursor changes to loading, but like everything else it's laggy and choppy. Not only after I get a little window in the upper left say has stopped with the option to force quit. I say no since I'm still hoping to salvage it but my only option is to force shutdown with the power button. I've since started back up and everything seems fine. I checked the event viewer, I have a custom log for errors, and it was hard to pick out anything that stood out aside from something labeled Tracing: Session stopped due to the following error: like most Window's error logs there wasn't really anything helpful on google. I also had an issue yesterday upon starting the computer where my keyboards lighting didn't turn on. I unplugged the SB and plugged it back in, which caused the keyboard to light up but also caused my mouse to temporarily freeze. The mouse came back after booking the Logitech G software that it uses, which of course also froze momentarily. (I really hate Logitech G Hub, it's caused me nothing but problems). My leading suspicions are:Some issue with my graphics driver. An issue with Chrome/YouTube specifically, the problem only occurs while watching videos with this combo of browser and website. An issue with Logitech G Hub. I'm not really sure how it would cause this but the software's so buggy and terrible I wouldn't be surprised. A deeper motherboard/IOS issue. The only reason I suspect this is because a while back, around December, I updated my IOS to prepare for Windows 11. I still haven't installed 11 but ever since the update post times have been unusually long, the Px always ends up booking and I can get into the IOS just fine but it takes far longer than it did on previous IOS versions. If nothing else works I'm praying that this is just a Win 10 issue and that maybe updating to 11 will leave the problem in the past but I'd really like to know something more concrete first. Edit: Spelling.  Discord and video games have been a little over distracting me from important stuff like school. So I'm removing the problem entirely and putting away my laptop and working on a different device. Because of how long I'll be gone (close to a month or two), will anything happen to my apps like, my browser, Discord, or any other apps. Like for say when I get back will I be logged out of everything? For some ungodly reason the process of logging back into accounts is a stressful thing for me. I just want to know if something or nothing bad will happen to my laptop while I'm gone. I know this is a stupid question but I want my anxiety riddled mind to rest.  I often find myself wasting time on instagram explore without even realizing it, I would still like to use it to check out what people that I am following are posting but I am curious if there is a way (some 3rd party app or something) to disable option on instagram.  Just got a new TX 3080 and a new EVA 850W SU. Played God of War and randomly while playing, will shut off my Px completely. Same thing with Apex Legends. Haven't tried any other games. Ran a stress test and benchmark on 3Mark and everything shows up fine except from the PU section. What looks like to me is my graphics card is overheating. But I'm not entire sure.  Hello friends,. I recently upgraded to a 3090 TX in my build from late 2016. I also installed a new SD (but did not migrate my Of files to it). I have been experiencing hard freezes when playing specific games. What I mean by hard freeze is that my entire system freezes, not just the game crashing to desktop. It is confusing because I can play rather demanding games such as Hell Let Loose and Squad without incident, but then I hop over to other games that consistently freeze after not playing for that long. I never had issues like these with my old card which was a 1080 TX. I have tried a few troubleshooting tips such as updating drivers, removing the old graphics card drivers, and checking the cables on the power supply and 3090. Here are my specs for reference:.

What should I do right now? . screenshot:.  Just recently bought this new mice, tested it out on the store and on my laptop and it worked fine but when I started updating its drivers using iCUE product software thing) it just entirely stopped working. Tried plugging it in different SB ports and unto my laptop again but got nothing.  I apologize if something like this has been discussed in some manner but I've legit been doing research for months and nothing can come close to this specific issue I have, basically my Px's performance feels affected and/or damaged whenever I use applications with my task manager closed, whenever I keep it open everything works just fine but it takes effect immediately when closed, at this point I just want some fix to this even if it requires me to do a full wipe on my Px (Considering I do have an external drive) but at the same time I don't want to risk anything by just doing something like that impulsively, I have tried running tests with Vast and the such and I don't seem to have anything to really fix, although if it's some sort of virus then it must be hard to get rid of to begin with, I'd really appreciate the help here, I could provide with information if needed too, thanks in advance.  Everytime I plug it in the red light show but in less than no time the blue light would com on but it just won't run on. I have read through the manual and tried different thing online. any suggestions would be welcomed. thanks.  Basically she got some kind of malware from a link she clicked on Facebook that created a window that kind of looks like a windows support message if you don't know any better, and it disabled her controls saying the Px was locked for safety. She called the number and the guy apparently got her to type something in the command box that let him have remote access to her computer for half an hour. Thankfully she hung up and called me once he started asking for and I talked through using safe mode, malwarebytes, and windows virus scan but they didn't detect anything so I had her restore to an earlier image from about a week ago and that seemed to stop the messages from returning. I think whatever file it was is now removed, and it seems to be working normally, but I want to make sure he doesn't still have access. She has home edition so Windows 11 Remote Desktop isn't available, I'm wondering what he could have had her type in the Run box to make a connection.  I recently bought a rebuilt NXT computer and when I plugged it into my monitor there were these green horizontal lines all over the screen. I don't know what would cause this and I have tried many things to fix it. I uninstalled it then reinstalled it. I updated it to it's latest version. I don't know what the problem is.  I'd like to store some important documents, passwords, and a will on a physical thumb drive, in addition to on the cloud. Are the SB-C drives you see on Amazon from reputable brands something that could comfortably hold data for 5 years without any read/writes in between?
