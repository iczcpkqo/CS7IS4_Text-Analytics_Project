One may easily find online platforms that support discussions of particular themes, and note that within
those themes, communities form. Sometimes people access the relevant fora to share information that
has little direct impact on the lives of most people and sometimes people seek information that has
immediate relevance for them (e.g. seeking to know the word an athlete was heard to utter during a
sporting event vs. advice on interpretting health-related symptoms. Pronouns have a role in forming
and representing group membership (e.g. “us” vs. “them”), but other words also have a role (witness
“with us” vs. “against us”). A relevant question is whether online fora individuated in functional terms
(e.g. mutual support vs. entertainment) establish groups in the same way.
