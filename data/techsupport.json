I have an HP Envy 5014 that has functioned properly in the past.  Now whenever I print it looks like html or something.  Says things like obj, identity, endobj, filter, flatedecode.  What is this crap? Do Brother or Epson printers have less issues because I have had nothing but headaches from HP and I am fed up.  I don't want to have HP smart or have to constantly update drivers or have to worry that the next version of windows is going to make my printer obsolete. I just want a printer that prints.  I recently updated to windows 11, could that be part of the issue? Please help",

Some H61 boards run Xeon without problems, some need BIOS update (didnt't find any for this AiO C540 mobo), some don't. With low TDP Xeon, heat is not problem.

The splitter would then route to each display.

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently bought some new parts for my PC. After installing them, I noticed that my Wi-Fi was much slower (25mbps plan, only getting max 3mbps download, but normal upload speeds). I decided to go ahead and reinstall windows, which fixed my problem. A few days ago, I booted up my pc and it went into recovery mode, and while the boot drive would be recognized in the BIOS as a storage device, I could not select it as a boot drive. It wouldn't even show up in the list. I decided to reinstall windows again after this, and it took some trial and error, but it finally was reinstalled and was bootable again. \n\nI have two problems now. \n\nThe first is that my Wi-Fi is again only getting a max of 3mbps download most of the time. I had some success running the trouble-shooter yesterday, which fixed it for a while until it reverted back to 3mbps. I have ran some ipconfig commands in the CMD which helped for a bit before it went back to being slow. I have also went into the device manager and reinstalled the adapter, and changed power settings, but nothing has changed from that. When I run speed test on my phone right next to my PC, it gets around 23-25mbps, as it should. My PC seems to be the only device in the house that is having trouble. \n\nMy second problem is my booting. When I booted up earlier, it went straight to BIOS and didn't recognize my SSD as a boot drive once again, but it would still recognize it as storage. I was able to finally get it to recognize it by skipping the BIOS and choosing it straight from the boot menu at startup, but I would like to keep this from happening again, as it is a hassle having to keep reinstalling 80+ GB games and all my programs when it happens. \n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you!",

    "text": "Hi, I'm having issues with either my GPU or the monitor. I have an MSI Optix G271 27'' 144 Hz 1 ms Freesync VA monitor, Gigabyte 2060 Super Windforce OC 8 GB GPU, Ryzen 5 3500X CPU, and Cooler Master 650W PSU. I am seeing horizontal lines across the monitor on the top half or top quarter of the screen.\n\nThe monitor has 2 HDMI and 1 DP slot while the GPU has 3 DP 1 HDMI slot. Currently, I have exhausted all DP slots in the GPU, as in, in whichever slot I put the cable, the issue remains. However, after several tries with HDMI slots, after a while, the screen turns somewhat normal. You can see from the images [https://imgur.com/a/7gc1lMC](https://imgur.com/a/7gc1lMC)\n\nAt first, I checked the monitor with a laptop and it seemed fine, but recently I read similar issues with MSI monitors so I am not sure. When I first encountered this, my solution was to switch to other DP ports and unplug/plug the GPU. This was fine for a week or so. Then, all the DP ports stopped displaying the same stuff so I moved on to the HDMI which was fine for a month or two. Now the issue is back. I read some stuff about allowing either the card or the monitor to heat itself which makes the lines disappear which I didn't try but seems hilarious (I accept that this started in the winter and happens almost every cold start but come on).\n\nI tried updating to the newest drivers as the issue was at first not driver-related, it did not start after a driver update or anything. I did DDU in safe mode (which did not show any lines and worked perfectly for some reason at 1080p) and installed the latest. For a day it solved the issue. The next day, they came back. Colorful UEFI screens were fine as well.\n\nAt this point, I ordered a new GPU and will RMA the card if I can. I need to filter out the monitor again, however, I do not have an option to test the DP ports in the GPU or Monitor. Encountering the same issue with HDMI may or may not filter out the DP issue. I do not know the electronics behind the HDMI/DP board/chips on the monitor or GPU. I will also blow out the dust and use another 8 pin connector/rail on PSU. I am open to other suggestions as well.",

Should I just use a high quality power strip with surge protection like something from Belkin? Or should I invest in a UPS?\n\nThe main issue I have is that my PC is roughly 3 meters / 10 feet away from the nearest wall socket. Unfortunately the Belkin Surge protectors only come with 2 meter length cables as far as I'm aware. When looking for ones with a 3m or longer cable I'm only finding lower end basic stuff. \n\nSo here are my main questions:\n\n- Does anyone know of a good surge protector that could handle all my hardware safely with a 3m cable or longer?\n- Would a UPS be the way to go? If so what brand / model of UPS would you recommend based on my system configuration.\n- If I do get a UPS i doubt the cable would be 3M long. So how would that work? Would I plug the UPS in to the wall socket, and then connect a power strip with a surge protector to the UPS? Or would I do it the other way around and connect the UPS to a surge protector?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I'm going crazy trying to find something that would have a 3m cable length or longer and also keep my PC (Which took me years to afford) safe and powered.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "Tried searching but keep finding testers that appear to require the cable to be terminated. I saw some that have alligator clips, but none really say the cable does not have to be terminated. \n\nI tried testing them before by terminating the cables. My tester was telling me they are not the same cable. The problem is that I don't know if they are not the same cable or if I did not do the termination correctly. The tester works as I tried it on an extra cable I have. \n\nThe cable I need to test is in the wall and is with some home theater cables that appear to go from my wall to the wall above the fireplace. There are two ethernet cables at the wall and two above the fireplace, so I assume they are the same.  It seems like the best way to test them would be with a tester that can test the cables without them being terminated.  \n\nIs there a tester that I can attach to the loose wires of the ethernet cable? If so, which one should I get or what should I look for in a tester so that I know which one to get? \n\nThanks",

    "text": "Hi all, I have this weird issue in some of the games that I play. When I play F1 2020 or Forza Horizon 5, the screen sometimes flickers once. After it flickers, FPS would significantly, and it would feel a lot worse. For example, before the flicker, I would get around 250+ fps on F1 2020, but after the flicker, it would go to 144 fps, with the lows feeling like around 60ish. This happened to both my previous gpu (Powercolor Red Devil 6900XT) and current gpu (EVGA FTW3 RTX 3080Ti). In both instances, I used the latest driver, ensuring the previous driver was removed using DDU before installing the newest drivers.\n\nMy specs are as follows: Gigabyte Aorus Pro Z690\n\nIntel i5 12600k\n\nCorsair h150i pro 360mm radiator\n\n32GB DDR5 Adata XPG\n\nEVGA FTW3 RTX 3080Ti\n\nEVGA Supernova G2 750W PSU\n\nSome things to note: GPU/CPU temperature are by no means high, with CPU being at around 60 degrees while GPU is at 80 degrees HOTSPOT temperature. After the flicker, GPU usage remains as per usual (running at high clockspeeds with power consumption same as before).\n\nAs the FPS for both games go to around 144fps after the flicker (which is the refresh rate of my monitor), I would think it is something to do with this.\n\nWould appreciate any feedback/help if anyone has experienced this before.

Somedays, though rarely, it doesn't happen at all.\n\nI've gone as far as timing how long it takes, and I noticed that it happens almost exactly on the hour mark after the first time, though sometimes it'll skip the second hour and do it the third. This has been happening for over a year now and I haven't found any forums or solutions in all the times I've gotten impatient enough to look for a fix myself, so I've finally decided to make my own forum.\n\nAll of the wifi connection options on my PC disappear, which is weird considering from my room I can usually still see the option to access one or two of my neighbor's routers when it's connected, same for on my phone. I've done a little digging, and the only thing I can think of is possibly a network overload during those times?? But that doesn't even add up considering how it's almost exactly at hour increments. Some days it'll happen at XX:39, others XX:08, but it's generally within the same minute, maybe a few seconds off into the next minute, but always a different hour.\n\nIn the past, we've called our ISP about it multiple times just for them to shoot off our issues and go promote the idea of upgrading our internet to a higher membership, as if that'd fix it. Basically long story short they don't give a fuck and just want more of our money. We have cable internet, I'm unable to use an ethernet cable due to my room being on another floor from the modem and router.\n\nTo also mention, this happens on the PC we have downstairs, which is connected via Ethernet cable as well, (no clue if it happens as often,) and I've looked into this being a DHCP lease issue, and it does appear that sometimes it is, in fact, the lease expiring on its own. This part I plan on fixing as soon as I can contact the ISP \\*yet again\\*. We've had wifi with this company for quite some time and everyone's apparently forgotten the password to access our router settings to change the lease expiration time. We've also switched to multiple different routers, but to no avail to fix this issue. Could it be a problem with our modem possibly..?\n\nPlease do give advice on how I can finally fix this issue if you have any ideas as to what's occurring, thank you for your time :).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you need specifics on what I'm using and the company, or anything else, just say so and I'll reply as soon as I can.",

Now whenever I try to connect to my home wifi I get the message \"No internet, secured.\" \n\nThe computer is running Windows10 and has been for almost 2 years without issue. I first thought it was an problem with my computer and attempted to solve it by following the instructions laid out [here](https://lazyadmin.nl/it/no-internet-secured-windows-10/) and [here](https://windowsreport.com/fix-no-internet-secured-wifi-issue-windows-10/). The only thing I haven't done is replace the driver. I took my computer to work the following day and found that it still connects to the wifi there, which seemed really strange to me.\n\nWhen I returned home I ran the troubleshooter and get the following message \"The remote device or resource won't accept the connection.\" I reset my GoogleHome and this didn't fix it either. \n\nI've now spoken to both Google and Dell and neither has been able to help. Google has said that its Dell's problem. And Dell says the computer is out of warranty, so just get a new one. \n\nAny help you guys can provide would be amazing.

It's working for about 2 days now and counting...\n* CPU Fan is working\n* My laptop is an Acer Aspire E15 575G-54YE, about 4 years old now\n* My charger and battery are third party, since the original ones broke\n* New battery was a year old on Febraury\n\n**Context + Problem**\n\n* When I play TFT (Teamfight Tactics from LoL), laptop shuts down like it lost electricity after 20-30 minutes. I'm still not trying other games but laptop has shut down for the 4th time now in varying durations. The longest was about an hour and a half (I played 2 and a half games before laptop shut down)\n* On my recent TFT run, I installed a CPU Temp monitor and it showed that I'm reaching a peak of 75-80 Celsius. Maximum temp was 100 so I'm guessing the CPU isn't the problem...\n* When I don't play, laptop runs fine and doesn't shut down.\n* I was able to run the laptop without the battery using my original charger. Now I can't boot the laptop without the battery plugged-in.\n\n**Possible Solutions (Will edit the post for results)**\n\n* ~~I tried setting the maximum possible performance of the CPU in the power settings from 100% to 98% in the hopes of reducing the heat of the CPU.~~ Doesn't solve it...\n* I used the CPU Stress Test by Intel Diagnostic Tools, CPU passed.\n* I have a lot of USB ports used (USB Microphone, an external keyboard, mouse and a type-C USB hub where my drawing tablet and laptop cooler is plugged in). I'm currently trying to only plug in my microphone, keyboard, and mouse.\n* ~~I tried setting TFT's graphic setting to low.~~ Didn't work. \n* I could buy another battery to solve all of this easily, but I want that to be my last resort. I'll be getting a new PC soon and that's where I plan to buy a new battery so that my dad can use this laptop. For now, I just need this thing to work without needing to buy a new one, since I need it for my classes.\n\nI can provide more details if you guys want. I would really like to know your opinion and diagnosis on this matter.\n\nUpdate 1: I finished a game of TFT without it shutting down. I wanted to cool the laptop down since I don't want to risk it so I made it idle for a few minutes. Surprisingly, it still booted off at idle. The heck?",

    "text": "I hope I can make this as descriptive as possible.\n\nI bought a 256 GB SanDisk microSDXC card for my Switch on Amazon 'cause there's a lot of cool old/upcoming games I wanna prepare to play this year. I'm trying to transfer my data to it from the old one, but I keep running into issues I don't know how to solve.\n\nFirst, I formatted the card to exFAT (if that's important). I had \\~117 GB to transfer from my old 128 GB card but the kb/s would always go to 0 mb/s a few seconds into the process. It would show that it'll take more than 1 day to finish it all, sometimes going down to a few hours, then jumping back up. No progress really gets made each time I try. \n\nI started to think that was too much to transfer all at once when someone on Twitter was surprised by the amount after I complained about it taking forever. Then I archived a lot of my games and deleted all of the photos and videos in my album, which brought it down to \\~27.7 GB. I've had much better luck (it got to 20% once) but it still messes up. The kb/s jumps up a little bit sometimes and a percent would get added every so often. The file that it displays it's currently working on doesn't change though, and the number of files left to go through is static while the progress bar moves (kinda). I can't stay around and babysit my laptop for days on end because of work so I have to pause the process a lot (which is how I made any progress at all over two days).\n\nWhile I'm transferring data I also get an error code that says, \"0x800703ee: The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid.\" Then there are options to retry and skip for the current file but I'm not sure what to press. There's also a box that says something like \"do this for all current items\" that I'm not sure I should check or not. I usually delete the files I've downloaded and format the card each time I want to start over, so I'm not sure how useful the skip button is. I've tried each one while also checking the box but no combination has changed much.\n\nI've read that formatting a card to NTFS would be better depending on the allocation size you use, but I guess mine doesn't allow that regardless because I get a message saying that windows can't complete it.\n\nAlso, I don't think that works on the Switch? I forgot where I read that, if I even remembered correctly. Anyway, I don't know what specs are specifically needed but this is as much as I can give:\n\n# Laptop\n\n* ROG Zephrus G14\n* Model - GA401 IV\n* Processor - AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS with Radeon Graphics (3.00 GHz)\n* Installed RAM - 16.0 GB (15.4 GB usable)\n* System Type - 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor\n* Windows 10 - Version 21H1\n\n# MicroSDXC Card\n\n* SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I\n* 256 GB\n* Read speed up to 120 MB/s\n* App Performance Class - A1\n* Speed Class - C 10\n\n# Card Reader\n\n*  Vivitar VIV-RW-7100-STP Mac &amp; PC USB Reader &amp; Writer",

It's not a frame rate drop in game; at least, the in game FPS counter doesn't think so.\n\n[In action](https://imgur.com/a/yatuGzS)\n\n\nSwitching to fullscreen mode fixes it, but why? I'm fine just using fullscreen the rest of my life, but it makes no damn sense why my performance would drop to slideshow levels. It's gotta have something to do with GeForce Experience because it didn't happen before I installed it.",

The crash usually gives a black screen with game music still playing, with the monitor not registering any video output, so I have to hard reset, which usually fixes it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, same thing happened, but hard resetting did nothing, even after multiple resets, the computer turned on but gave no video output. I did some research online and saw people suggesting taking out individual RAM sticks  for this sort of issue. I took one out and it worked, which made me think it was a faulty stick! But on booting up Witcher, the game was laggy as hell, to the point of not getting past the first loading screen. No worries, I thought, it's just because I'm playing with half the RAM. I load the \"faulty\" one back in, and same result. On checking Task Manager, CPU usage on the Witcher main menu is around 100%, whereas memory is only about 50%. I try with only the other stick in, same problem. I also tried another game on a different drive, same problem, so it's not an issue with the drive.\n\nThis makes me think that somehow the CPU is stuffed, but I'm not entirely sure why the computer turned back on when I took that RAM stick out. Maybe a coincidence? Or would a faulty RAM stick make my CPU max out its processing power with simple tasks? I also started noticing this issue when I got myself a new monitor and started using Display Port instead of HDMI, but god knows how a peripheral would have this effect.\n\nAt this point I can tell something isn't working but I want to be sure what I need to replace first. Also, all of my components, save my HDD (with the Witcher 3 on it) and one of my SSDs (with the OS on it) are no more than 2 years old.\n\nThank you so much in advance for any help!\n\nBuild:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600 6-core 3.4GHz\n\n MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX ATX AM4 Motherboard \n\nRadeon RX580\n\nG.Skill  Ripjaws V 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 Memory \n\nCorsair CX650M PSU",

    "text": "Hello, I come here as I've done a lot of searching around and trying to fix this issue to no avail. Basically I have a 2TB Seagate HDD that plugs in via USB, it's barely a year old so my suspicions of a hardware failure are slim. So, when playing games from it I started getting some slowdowns and I've written/deleted a lot of files in it (almost filling it up once), so I decided to check if it was fragmented a couple of days ago and it showed to be 30% fragmented by the Windows tool, so I started defragmenting it but never really let it finish (I properly canceled it each time) because sometimes I had to switch OS or just shut down the laptop. So little by little the fragmentation kept getting lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday in the morning when I plugged the drive it didn't show up in file explorer to my surprise, (the drive does receive power) I checked on disk management and nothing there, after removing it, plugging it etc. Nothing happened. I checked device manager but there was only the old register of the device, when I uninstalled the driver it never reinstalled after reboot. I have ran diskpart and list disk and only my internal SSD shows up, I also tried plugging it on the other port, on an USB hub too but nothing, I plugged a USB drive and it worked so its not a port issue. Also Linux lsblk shows nothing, at least I didn't recognize the drive, only partitions of the main one. After a few restarts I settled down on Windows and after having the drive plugged in for a while it was recognized, with its files intact, from there it worked. So I figured it probably was screwed from the defragmenting process, so I reran it so that it could finish properly, I started playing in the same drive because I had nothing to do and all was good, until I heard the Windows 11 device removed sound, and then the plugged sound immediately, of course the defragmenting was canceled, and the game closed down, and from then I'm back to square one. It doesn't show up again even after waiting for a while and restarting multiple times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additional info, I also ran Seatools and the disk doesnt show up, only a weird MSFT XVDD thats supposed to be an Xbox thing (Its always there whether the HDD is plugged or not) EaseUS and Testdisk show nothing too. I'll gladly appreciate any help, thanks for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Important detail, the Optimize drives tool from Windows shows this under additional drives: \\\\\\\\?\\\\Volume{322d3815-67c9-c392-dea1-61e7c430f987}\\\\ as a hard disk drive. Its very likely to be that, but why does it only show up here?",

Really just need a pointer in the right direction.\n\nI have a modern high-end laptop (W11 compatible) with an internal NVMe drive. Intending to wipe the drive, and create the following dual-boot setup:\n\n1) Windows 11 system installed on C drive; C drive will be encrypted via BitLocker TPM &amp; PIN.\n\n2) Secondary Windows 10 or Windows 11 system which will be installed on the D drive. No BitLocker.\n\nHow would the logistics of this work? Since the primary system will be on an encrypted drive, but I don't want it to prompt for the PIN unless I'm booting it.\n\nI think that the bootloaders nowadays live on the dedicated EFI partition? So then I am assuming it shouldn't matter, because there would be no \"primary\" or \"secondary\" system. The boot menu would simply load off of the EFI partition, and then if I select option 1 --&gt; it prompts me for the BL password and boots the first system, and with option 2 --&gt; it just boots the secondary system.\n\nDoes this sound accurate and more or less straightforward?

Disk utility says 15b GB of 2TB used but when I open the drive there's only 2GB worth of files showing. Is there a possibility the files I lost are still there?\n\nMy Early 2015 MacBook Pro was starting to get slow a few weeks ago since I was running out of space so I decided to go ahead and back it up wipe it and restart. I used a 2TB Seagate External Hard Drive that I originally purchased for my Xbox but have been using as an external drive for my MacBook for a few months now with no issues. Before I began the backup I had about 2 TB worth of projects I've spent a long time working on. Since I had a bunch of unused files on my MacBook I manually sorted through everything instead of using Time Machine. Moved everything I wanted to keep onto the drive (including the files that were natively stored not he drive) ejected and wiped my computer. After setting my computer up again (running macOS Catalina like before bc I don't like upgrading)  I plugged in the drive and to my shock only the last fee items I moved were there. Originally I had given in and just accepted that I had bad luck but I decided to add up the space of all the files and it came to about 1.8 GB whereas Disk Utility says the drive has 15GB used. Are the files I'm missing possibly still on the drive? Maybe they are hidden like how Windows hides folders like %AppData%? If this is even a possibility how do I go about getting them to show?

    "text": "I have to share bad news with you.\n\nApproximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Some time ago I hacked you and got access to your email accounts: (school e-mail, one i barely use) .Obviously, I have easily hack to log in to your email.\n\nYour password: (password)\n\nOne week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).All ingenious is simple. =)This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.\n\nLikewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...\n\nWhile gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.\n\nIf you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.\n\nLet's settle it this way:You transfer $400 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.\n\nThis is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.\n\nHere is my bitcoin wallet: (his wallet, dont know if i should share here?)\n\nThings you need to avoid from doing:\\*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).\\*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.\\*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.\\*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.\n\nThings you don't need to worry about:\\*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).\\*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!\n\nEverything will be done in a fair manner!\n\nOne more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.: one of details Im referring to is the spicy part above. Re-installing Avast hopefully will do something ;-; (detected no malware ofc, but saud my webcam is vulnerable, any tips for that?). Its weird because it would me 100x more efective if he had included one of those \"videos\", and the social media part...

We did replace the wifi cards after getting some high ping in game, and that worked like a charm. Now we're trying to go from playing on the couch to playing on desks, which includes some external peripherals. This presented a unique challenge when we realized that we bought laptops without HDMI ports (fail).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to amend that we got these USB/HDMI converters:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087PD9KSZ/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_image?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087PD9KSZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt works great when we plug them into our smaller 24\" external monitors, but were hoping to game on the 34\".

The scale is blown up and the edges of the Valorant game client are cut off of the screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would figure out how to put a screen shot in here for your reference but just imagine it looks horrible and gross and you wouldn't want to play on it :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I realize the problem was probably getting a gaming laptop for Valo in the first place instead of an external case with the proper ports. Is there an easy fix I don't know about to get the hardware i've purchased to date to work how I'm intending? Appreciate any tips you can throw my way! I know it has USB-C ports, if I got that kind of converter might it work better for some reason?",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs the title says, I recently put together a new build with the AMD 5800x, Asus ROG x570 ITX, Samsung 980 SSD, 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX, a Cooler Master V750 SFX, and the Gigabyte 3060ti.\n\nIn Windows, after installing nVidia drivers, the computer has severe lag and hitches/stutters, and goes to a black screen every 3-5 minutes, more notably after engaging the GPU in some way (loading Chrome, starting Furmark, a game, etc). I booted a USB stick with Ubuntu on it, and noticed a similar pattern: When using the non-nVidia graphics drivers in Ubuntu, I had no issue. I ran CPU benchmarks in Ubuntu with no issue either. However, once enabling the nVidia proprietary drivers, I was getting the exact same issues, severe lag, hitches, freezes, crashes/black screens.\n\nI first tried Memtest86, showing no errors after 4 passes. Errors also do not occur during BIOS, or while Memtest is loaded, so in situations where the nVidia GPU is running in 'fallback mode', doing just basic software rendering of simple GUIs, there seems to be no problems. I tried swapping RAM sticks with another PC, no change. I tried a BIOS update as well, and resetting BIOS settings, and again, no change. I swapped PSU's, and again, no change. Finally, swapping in an old nVidia 1060, the problem entirely cleared up. I ran Asus RealBench for 3 hours, and noticed no issues whatsoever.\n\nIs the GPU bad, or is there another potential remedy to this that I might not have tried? It was purchased from a (seemingly decent and honest) guy on Craigslist, who purchased it originally only a few months prior, and came with original packaging. I was going to try a CMOS reset, but I've read with these Asus x570 boards, that requires unplugging the motherboard's battery, which is absolutely buried underneath a bunch of metal crap, so I've been reluctant to try that.\n\nOf course I realize, it being Craigslist, that I might have been sold a crap GPU, but I'm hoping to ask here for any things to try before going through the difficult process of trying to get my money back on a Craigslist exchange, or trying to send it in for RMA.\n\nThe one thing on my to-do list is to try swapping the 3060ti into an old PC and seeing if the problems follow the GPU to the old PC. I'll edit with an update once I do.\n\nThanks all!",

After this, both monitors completely shut off. I turned on my main monitor and the two programs I had open at the time were tripled.

After I did so, i turned the PC back on my second monitor wasn't working (I already fixed that issue, just a bad HDMI cord) But the main issue is the fact that I cant run any games. A very non-graphic intensive game like Roblox runs at 1-2 fps. Whenever I open Warthunder it says: Vide mode initialization error.

I have a PC and my phone connected to the same wifi with no issues. I have googled the problem and went through the suggested steps like turning off background updates, resetting network settings multiple times, restarting the router and modem countless times, new modem (suggested by my ISP), checking for driver updates, turning off startup programs, moving the laptop right next to the router, and some others. This happens off and on, and sometimes it works with no issues.

He told me that he wasn\u2019t able to mount the cpu cooler and that some pins were missing on the cpu and that i could have it for free. I checked the cpu multiple times and all pins are still on the cpu i also managed to mount the cooler however when i try to start it only the fan spins up and nothing else happens.\n\nI Tried to connect a low power gefroce 8400GS for video output but no dice the Apu also doesn't output any video. I tried both of the ram slots but nothing changed i also tried booting it without the ram in it if it would do any beep post codes but it never beeps with or without the ram. I think that the board is probably dead i have build multiple systems but never an amd system before. I dont really know if the mainboard has a beeper installed or if it maybe needs an bios update to support the cpu.

Games run at 30-40% GPU utilization, and often run below 60fps at lowest settings. Every GPU benchmark I ran used 100% GPU and showed respectable results for my GPU model. But game performance is poor compared to the benchmarks of other people with the same system. I have tried switching power plans both within the Dell Power manager and windows, reinstalled windows completely severl times, updated drivers, tweaked Nvidia control panel and did a few other things to no success.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this behavior comes and goes every few months. Before theissue came back a week ago, my laptop ran pretty well  for a few months, with occasional shut offs during games and some problem where I would have to restart the computer a couple of times before it recognized being plugged into the charger.\n\nIt feels like I tried almost everything and I am really considering just buying a new machiene.\n\nWhat could cause this strange behavior?

I found out that all AirPods sold before October 2020 may be apart of a recall. I\u2019m a college student and was home for spring break last week, so I went to an apple store to have mine evaluated to see if they\u2019d be apart of the recall. Sure enough, both of my AirPods failed the test they put them through and they gave me a new replacement pair for free (just the individual AirPods, not the case). I used them that night and they worked great. I was completely blown away by the difference. I hadn\u2019t realized how bad my old ones had gotten. Anyways, today I put them in again for the second time and the right one won\u2019t connect or respond to anything I do. I tried resetting them, re-pairing them, etc and nothing is working. I\u2019m wondering if anyone knows what to do. The warranty on my broken pair that I turned in was expired, but would they give me a new replacement for this one since it literally stopped working out of nowhere? I also didn\u2019t drop them, water damage them, or anything like that so I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s not working.",

Cyberpunk 2077 would crash within 5 minutes of load, Far Cry 6 about half an hour. Rocket League sometimes works for hours, sometimes crashes after an hour and a half. Every time the frame freezes, the music goes on and eventually, crash to desktop.\n\nRecently, however, I've started getting BSODs with the error mentioned in the post title. The funny thing is, while the game runs, it runs perfectly fine. There is no artifacting, no random freeze and plays (except before crash) and no stutters to speak of. it's all smooth sailing until the ship drowns suddenly (metaphorically speaking).\n\nI haven't changed much. Recently got a Colorful RTX 3070, swapping out my old RTX 2060. The thing is, the crashes used to take place on the 2060 as well, but never got this weird BSOD before. I've stress tested the GPU with Furmark for about 20 minutes at a stretch. Steady temps of 69-70 degrees. Cinebench works perfectly. GPU Stability test was completed up to 37 minutes, no issues whatsoever.\n\nOh, and I installed Windows 11 about a month ago. These errors have increased substantially since the new OS was installed.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit : Dump files uploaded here -  https://files.catbox.moe/x6opdg.zip ",

I also installed USB Overdrive to try to control it that way, but I couldn't get that to work either--presumably the device is being controlled by another driver, but I couldn't figure out which one(s) in the drivers folders (/Library/Extensions and /System/Library/Extensions) to delete.\n\nIn the USB device tree, the device is listed as:\n\nPic16C745/765 USB Keyboard:\n\n  Product ID:\t0x0002\n  Vendor ID:\t0x04d8  (Microchip Technology Inc.)\n  Version:\t4.41\n  Speed:\tUp to 1.5 Mb/s\n  Manufacturer:\tMicrochip\n  Location ID:\t0x14130000 / 3\n  Current Available (mA):\t500\n  Current Required (mA):\t100\n  Extra Operating Current (mA):\t0\n\nAny guidance or suggestions are much appreciated.

I have even tested it by removing the battery, plugging it into a wall socket and tested the power that way, but it does the same thing. I tried the novo pin on the side, it boots into the BIOS menu, but shuts off after 3-5 seconds. At first I thought it was maybe the battery or adapter, but I even bought new ones despite even disconnecting the old battery and trying the method of using the charger only. I checked all the wires and cables, and they're all in place securely, and the laptop isn't dirty on the inside. Is there anything that may fix this issue, or is the laptop completely flatlined?

I was experiencing some trouble with a game, FPS wise.( The issue being on the games end not mine). At the time I didn't know this, therefore I looked up a few fixes for the issue. Some of them included clearing the dirextX cache via disk clean up, other were updating Nvidia Graphics card drivers and the last one i did was deleting all the contents in the DXcache in Nvidia file. I first cleared DirextX cache via disk clean up and performed a Nvidia card driver update and then I cleared the DXcache. This is when I first encountered the weird artefact for a split second. However, after the initial split artifact no other problems, issues or artifacts appear. My GPU temps are normal both Idle and underload, my FPS and performance in games is normal. Also it only appears on my main monitor and not my second monitor. I looked up the cause of this issue online and people were saying various issues, like failing hardware, bad drivers. I performed a DDU and it didn't fix the issue, also I ahve a 3070 OC edition but I haven't done any overclocks myself to it. Any advice would be greatly apricated. \n\nI have a 3070  \n16 GB  \nAMD 3600  \nB550 Game a Pro  \nCorsair RM 750W Gold 80+",

I would like to replace it before it become fully stripped, and not possible to remove without involving a professional again.\n\nHowever, I face two problems:\n\n    It is a captive screw (the type where it stays on the back cover when it is unscrewed). How do I replace that?\n    The screw list does not list what type of screw it is.\n\nThe last bullet point makes me question whether this is even possible, but I'd like to know for sure.\n\nThanks!\n\nSupport manual for Laptop: https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-15-7567-laptop/inspiron-15-7567-service-manual/procedure?guid=guid-d255a103-23eb-40da-9fb5-f25446ae88e6&amp;lang=en-us",

    "text": "Hello friends,   \nAs one  of the most tech-savvy (read: young) people working for my nonprofit, I often get tasked with internet related issues, and this one is beyond my general \"turn it off and back on again\" level of knowledge. So here's what I'm dealing with and why I'm reaching out to the wider community: \n\nWe are currently running a mesh router system (Eero) due to the size of the main office building and multiple buildings on the property we've recently acquired. Our internet provider is Litewire, which came highly recommended to us by the previous owner of the property. \n\nThe problem lies here however: Our internet will cut out for five to ten seconds at a time, making things like the obligatory zoom meetings all but impossible to manage. I think I got \"paused\" in the course of an hour long meeting today around twenty times. The feed just cuts out and people can't hear me. When I spoke to Litewire, they came out, adjusted a few things, and emailed the following: \n\n&gt;\"To avoid interfering with the connection to our tower, the 5ghz wifi channel on the customer's router should be set to channel 36 (5180mhz/5.18ghz).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It looks like the customer has an Eero mesh wifi system, and as far as I know, those don't give you the ability to manually set the wifi channel, so there's no way to prevent it from interfering.\" (Read: Sucks to suck, bro).\n\nSo in my brain, I'm thinking, 'okay, I can just order a new mesh router system' but, NOPE. None of the ones I can find for a reasonable price (again, working for a nonprofit here) will let you manually set the wifi channel. \n\nI called Eero tech support and they said that they also can't change the wifi channel, but recommended I try using it in \"bridge mode\". Well, that was even worse, with the added suck of our printer not being able to connect to the wifi when it's in that mode. \n\nWhat are my next steps, Reddit? Should I look at a different ISP? Is there a mesh wifi system I haven't found that allows channel-changing? I could potentially set up a non-mesh wifi system, but I'm thinking that might require some shenanigans to get service all through this 3 story office barn. \n\nPlease let me know if there's a subreddit better suited to answer this question, but y'all were the first place I thought of. Thanks!",

    "text": "In January I put together a new PC build, borrowing my old PSU and GPU. Everything else is new. While I had a few issues getting it to boot in the first place, I eventually got it going (something was not plugged in).\n\nFirst time I booted it up I got a big smell out of it, plasticy and chemically. I didn't think much of it because I know new components can smell. It did get better over time. However it never went away fully. I figured it should have dissipated by the start of March so I gave the PF a good smell test and cleaning. I smelled the PSU, nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the GPU. The only place I got a big smell from was the exhaust fan at the back of the case. It smelled heavily of that same smell. A cloying plasticy/chemical smell and it has a bitter feel to the air quality. Since I couldn't find it anywhere else I figured that must be the culprit. I took that out and got a new Noctua fan to replace it.\n\nThe smell is better, but definitely still this though. I don't smell it as heavily from the rear of the case anymore and I can't seem to pinpoint where it'd be coming from. It changes the air quality slightly in that small room and has a slightly bitter taste in the air. My wife says she can't smell it but I know it's there. Should I wait longer to see if it fully goes away? Is there anything else I can try?\n\nThis is my build: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/BJLcqm](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/BJLcqm)\n\nOh, one other thing I forgot to mention. I had huge trouble getting the 24 pin power cable into the motherboard. Way too much pressure to put it in. Nothing was bent or anything though. Other power cables fit in it fine and the cable that gave me trouble went into my old MB just fine. I got a Lian Li Strimmer extension to bridge the two together and that worked fine.\n\nEdit: Temps are perfect, GPU never goes above 69\nCPU in Cinebench never went above 86 (very normal for this CPU)\nWith Undervolting it never went above 72 in Cinebench",

My setup is that I have keyboard, mouse, and shared monitor that connects to the switch. The switch then outputs to my docking monitor (P2422HE) for my work laptop can take all of the peripherals, so I just have to plug my USB-C to the laptop like a USB-C docking station. Note that the docking monitor is not the shared monitor that also connects my personal computer. \n\nWhenever I plug in my laptop to the docking monitor, the switch recognizes the mouse but not the keyboard. I always have to replug the keyboard that goes into the switch to get it recognized. I don't have this issue if I boot up my laptop while it is already docked. \n\nIs there a solution for this without needing to shut down computer before docking or without reconnecting the keyboard manually?",

I want to buy one that supports USB 3.2 (for my webcam) but I've only been able to find one or two that do. And one thing I've noticed about the switch market is that the devices seem to be very buggy, prone to failure and defects, poorly designed, and there aren't very many trustworthy manufacturers making them.\n\nI'm wondering if there are any alternatives to switches. I can't imagine what they would be, but maybe someone out there can suggest something. I'm kinda amazed that the switch market is so poor when there must be a lot of people switching between machines - especially these days.\n\nEDIT: Some extra details about my current setup: I have a single monitor, mouse, keyboard, microphone,  webcam, and speaker set I'm switching between two devices: a work laptop and a personal desktop tower. I have the mouse, keyboard, and microphone plugged into the KVM switch. My monitor has inputs for multiple devices, so I use that to swap between video and audio sources.

Sometimes there are colored strips with elements of the program that I had open before. If I'm lucky I get a windows device connected sound after a few seconds to a minute. And the main monitor comes on again. The second monitor remains black. If I'm unlucky, I have to restart the computer. The fans stay the same. I can't do anything during the stripes or the black screen. For example, pausing a video, opening the task manager, etc. Surprisingly, the system has never crashed in the middle of a game. Often when I open new things. For example google, file explorer, steam, just any new window. My theory is that the GPU clock is too high. When I'm in a game, the highest GPU clock is 1228.1MHz and the memory clock is 1752.8MHz. Msi Afterburner shows a GPU clock of 1228MHz and a memory clock of 3505MGz. The GTX 770 has a clock according to the internet of 1046MHz  boost clock of 1085MHz. 1753MHz memory clock. What speaks against it is that the GPU also crashes in the desktop.

I\u2019ve been having issues where the motherboard VGA fault light will appear after a reboot (but not always), changing display inputs on monitors or it going to sleep mode overnight.  It has been doing this consistently since the build has been complete.  In order to recover it can take different tasks such as: pulling CMOS and GPU for about 10mins and reinstalling, shutting down and pulling power cable out of PC for about 30mins, a series of reboots.\n\nWhat I find strange is once the system is up and running it will run without seemingly zero issues for hours.  But next day every time now it will not boot and I\u2019m forced to do one of these tasks above.  Typically pulling CMOS will fix the issue every time but other results vary.\n\nTasks I\u2019ve tried:\n-Reseat CPU.\n-Reseat memory.\n-Reseat M.2 storage.\n-Plugged GPU into other PCIE port.\n-Flipped to other BIOS chip on GPU.\n-Reseat all power cables at motherboard/GPU and power supply.\n-Adjust motherboard position (BIOS Flash button stuck under backplate).\n-Reloaded Windows OS.\n-Updated all drivers/BIOS for hardware.\n-Downgraded GPU BIOS one version.\n-Enabled D.O.C.P. profile in BIOS.\n\nPC Build Info\n\nCPU: \t\tRyzen 5600x\n\nGPU: \t\tRadeon RX 6600 XT Speedster QICK 308\n\nMB: \t\tASUS TUF B550\u2013Plus WiFi II\n\nRAM: \t\tCorsair Vegeance RGB PRO 2x8GB 3600MHZ\n\nPS: \t\tEVGA GT SuperNOVA 80 Plus Gold 650W\n\nStorage: \tSamsung EVO 970 Plus 500GB\n    \t\tSeagate Barracuda 2TB\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do at this point to correct the issue.

Two monitors are connected to the GPU via display port. One display port and one HDMI port are still free.\n\nThis means: I start the PC, the mainboard LEDs indicate the classic boot process. The water cooling and the fans of the GPU start. The mainboard LEDs do not indicate an error and everything runs normally - but I do not get a picture on the monitor. It doesn't change anything whether the monitor was previously in standby mode, completely switched off or switched on. Nor does it change anything which display ports I use.\n\nI don't think it's the monitor either, as it was already connected to the same GPU on the old PC via display-port.\n\nMaybe that is important: I noticed that whenever I do NOT get a picture on the monitor, the keyboard and mouse lights are also disabled - looks like they are not getting any power. If the keyboard and mouse are illuminated shortly after the start, the image also appears shortly afterwards.\n\n**Does anyone know what else I could try? Thank you for your help!**\n\nI have already tried that:  \nFirst, I reset the PC, formatted the operating system hard drive and reinstalled Windows 11. After that I updated the BIOS/UEFI to the latest version (not beta!). Then I did all the updates via Windows Update, downloaded the latest drivers via the MSI website, downloaded and installed NVidia Geforce Experience and the latest drivers.\n\n\u00b4What else you need to know:  \nThe GPU was already installed in my \"old\" PC and worked perfectly there.

Some cyrillic letters of this input have to be typed by  typing two letters  for example by typing \u0446 + \u0445 you would get \u0447 and  usually there is like a pause in the input between typing the letters.\n\nBut in the last week or so every time i try to type some letters like \u0441,  \u0447, \u044b which are part of such combos they get typed twice like cc, \u044b\u044b and  so on, and I'm unable to type all of these combined letters.   Everything works fine with the on-screen keyboard and in the windows  search bar, it's Microsoft Word and browsers that have this problem.  I've tried updating, scanning, using a restore point, and nothing has  solved this. Please help\n\nPS: when booting up the laptop it usually works fine for a couple of  minutes then it all comes back\n\n[Here's what it looks like when it's fine](https://i.imgur.com/dN1DpyV.jpg)\n\n[Here's what it looks like when it doesn't work correctly](https://i.imgur.com/jhaQUjO.jpg)",

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI finally upgraded my old PC but am now running into a lot of trouble. I upgraded the MoBo, CPU, and RAM. I attached my Microsoft account beforehand, per the guide I was following, hoping that Windows would boot without any issue after the swop as I've not changed my SSD or hard drive. But the Bios menu said it found no bootable devices.\n\nI've made a Windows Installation Media on a thumb drive, but now it looks like it's going to wipe my data on whatever drive I install Windows on. I'd prefer to put it on my SSD for quick boots, but I'm worried that the game I'm playing may not have my save backed to the cloud (didn't think to check before this). I also don't have a SATA to USB cord to copy the files beforehand.\n\n**So my first question: is there any way to use the bios menu to access/copy file from a hard drive/SSD to a USB drive attached to the MoBo without having to go through an OS?** Next, if I opt to just install Windows on the hard drive (because I'm pretty sure my save would be on the SSD), can I later move the OS to the SSD without issues? Finaly, more niche: does any one know how to check if a Steam game has a cloud save/backup through your Steam account on a browser? The computer I'm on doesn't have Steam and cannot (work device).\n\nI appreciate any help you can provide!",

It has on rare occasion kept acting like the key is still being pressed.\n\n2- PC acts like the shift key is pressed\n\nThere is nothing I can do about this, it starts and stops on its own, unplugging and replugging my mouse and keyboard does not stop this either.\n\n3- PC starts writing \"ded\" non stop\n\nWhen I select a text field whether in a browser, in game or discord, ded starts to be written infinitely. The very weird solution to this is unplugging my mouse? It does not have any key mappings that would let it write the letter d or e.\n\nThe worst weird behavior that has happened was new folders were being non stop created on my desktop and following some key spamming from me it started opening file explorers non stop where at that point I hard shut down the pc. This has happened only once.\n\nNone of these issues happened prior to my hardware change, I use a Razer huntsman elite keyboard and a Razer naga trinity mouse and have been for over a year now. I've had recurring issues with my mouse a few months back where replugging it fixed them(I can't remember for the life of me what they were but I just know I couldn't use my buttons and had to switch to only using my keyboard when it happened while playing wow). Those issues stopped and never happened again without me doing anything.\n\nThe 12 mouse buttons are mapped to shift+1 to = keys on the keyboard. \n\nI've just now mapped the letter \"t\" to one of my mouse buttons to see if it is a keyboard issue and will see if it is a mouse issue by unplugging it and using a text field with my keyboard.\n\nThe environments in which it has happened were when I was playing wow and had chrome/discord open or just chrome and discord. There is usually a stream playing on my browser when this happens. Although I've had Elden ring on one monitor with wow on another monitor and my friend's discord screen share on a third monitor with no issues whatsoever.\n\nThanks for any help, I'll report back with more findings when this happens again.\n\nEdit: The shift key is currently stuck, this happened after I recreated the last instance where this happened, running wow while downloading a game from the epic games store. I should also point out that I ran all the windows updates after I booted my pc post hardware change. I can also confirm that the shift key being pressed persists through my mouse being unplugged or keyboard being unplugged, oddly enough sometimes when I press the t key mapped to my mouse, it keeps spamming it until i click the mouse button again.\n\nEdit 2: After about an hour of having the shift key stuck, I found a potential solution online that said to hold down both shift keys for 5 seconds and it somehow worked. Still doesnt tell me why this is happening but at least I have a work around in the meantime.",

It also didn't boot anymore unless powercable was removed for a couple of hours (sometimes, however, I got lucky and it would boot after  I reseated some stuff or just after waiting a few minutes). Although it wont boot, rgb leds on mobo would be on, but when pushing power button the fans would turn on, turn off after 2 secs and nothing happens.\n\nTo troubleshoot I started removing different parts to see if it would change anything. But even when it was just the mobo with cpu/cpu fan and psu it would still show the same behaviour (sometimes working, sometimes not). I understand that it can't boot with just cpu, but I wanted to see if I at least got the check lights on mobo, which didn't happen. I also ordered a new psu to check if that was the issue, but with the same set up (mobo out of case, just cpu and cpu fan) still nothing.\n\nNow I figured it was the mobo as this was the only part left and if it would be the cpu I would at least get a check led on the mobo telling me the cpu was the issue. I have RMA'd the mobo, asus 'fixed' it, but to no avail and I still have the same issue.\n\nHas anybody encountered something like this before? Any idea what the issue could be? At this point I am thinking about just buying a new mobo (and psu to be extra exra sure) and hope that works. But since it's still under warranty that feels rather silly if it is the mobo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUILD:\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 3700X  \nAsus TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI)  \nCorsair DDR4 Vengeance LPX 2x8GB 3200 (times 2)  \nCorsair RM650x PSU  \nCrucial MX500 1TB SSD  \nSapphire Radeon RX 5700 XT PULSE",

Then the two short ones and the other long one at the bottom. \n\nBecause of the two long ones sharing IRQ assignments, I'm assuming it would be better that I install the expansion cards into one of the short slots (please correct me if I'm wrong), but the top one is underneath the GPU's fans, so can't use that one.

    "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI have been having some performance issues for a while with my laptop and I am not sure what else I could do.The issues at hand are the following, first when I play any game that I can clearly run with my specifications I encounter constant frame drops,some games more than others and in no particular logic.My model is Predator PH315-52Specs:\n\nIntel i7 2.60ghz 9750h Coffeelake\u00a0Windows 10 64xStock 16gb Ram Dual Channel 2666hzGtx 1660ti 6gb driver 511.65\n\nFor instance, I will play CS;GO and I will be clocking at 144fps with vsync or 240 without.\u00a0Running the game conservatively for competitive advantage some graphical settings are turned off and overall profile is high-medium.Mid game I will have sudden fps drops to 30 sometimes 40 for a second and then recover.Then for instance if I play Battielfield 1\u00a0I will also have fps fluctuations but more stable than csgo (which is weird) at higher graphical settings (ultra) but stillmy fps will sharply decline to around 56-60 from 110-120 without seeming to be affected by intensity of combat or effects at the moment.\n\nNow what's weird is this doesn't seem to be affected by adjusting my graphical settings in no way shape or form.I bought Squad recently and if I set the game on Ultra 50-60 fps Low 50-60fps all fluctuating and freezing despite minimal or maximum graphic settings.Other games I had issues with are GTA 5 and Rainbow six siege.\n\nI also have random BSOD critical\\_process\\_died error 0x000000 and its seemingly unrelated to the current load or lack there off on the PC which I don't know is connected or not to the current fps issues and I haven't been able to resolve it. I researched and looked into the general ways to resolve it and no avail but PC functions fine and all components and the overall system is doing good just at times here and there BSOD pops up either when idle, waking up from sleep or exiting a game.\n\nThings I have tried.\n\n* Windows Restore\n* Registry sfc scan and DCIM scan (no issues)\n* Drivers upgrade/dowgrade (No effect on fps but better graphics and game experience in general)\n* Defrag HDD\u00a0\n* Optimize SSD and HDD\n* Delete junk, temps\n* Scan for malware\u00a0\n* Clean and re-paste thermals and fans\n* Use various programs to speed up the computer\n* Disable a bunch of most common services hogging up memory and performanceChanged power plan settings, modes and used this thing that helps you further modify it\n* Use turbo boost and overclock\n* Under-volt and lower clock speed of the cpu (throttle stop)Use stand by ram cleaner (ISLC)\n* Clear real time ram (current things using my ram in the background)Disable start up apps\n* Disable useless windows apps and settings like cortanaRegistry edit for performance boost\n* Uninstall and reinstall drivers clean\u00a0Upgrade the BIOS from windows update (BSOD) then recovered\n* Tweaked nvidia control panel\n* Un-parked cores\n* Used manufacturer health scans and updates etc\n* Updated all peripheral necessary applications such as directx, C++, .NETframework\n* Re configured all windows services and disable useless ones (carefully)\n* Scream internally\n\nI am really not sure what else to do and I haven't owned a gaming laptop before and I am just confused about these issues.\n\nany help is appreciated!\n\nEDIT:  https://files.catbox.moe/fjrosw.zip  Dump files",

    "text": "Hello all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the last couple of weeks, my 8 years old lenovo laptop (still in good shape), has been asking for a windows reboot , every time i start it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni think this problem started due to me often falling asleep while watching some series, without the charger being plugged in, so there was often a sudden shutdown due to power shortage.\n\nin the past, there would be no issue. Just a slow start up, now it's asking for a reboot. even when i've shut the laptop down properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can usually fix the problem by tampering with it for half an hour but i really have no idea what im doing at said moment. i continuously try all the presented options, try to use the F8 strategy (it doesnt work most of the times) . It only works after turning the pc off and on again and again. All of a sudden, the problem is fixed but i dont know why.  Losing half an hour each time is really maddening and i'd really like to be able to fix this problem. \n\n**can someone explain this monke what he should do to fix this?**\n\n, i know its an old laptop but it runs fine and im rather attached to it. the only games i play, are rather old ones as i dont have the time for proper gaming. i was looking into upgrading it from 8Gb to 16 GB  and upgrading the SSD (some tech place said they could do this)\n\nAllready looking into getting a external hard drive so i can tamper with the laptop without losing important stuff.",

It happens to me with browsers, games and other programs like the Wallpaper Engine.\nI tried using other programs to measure GPU peaks, but the results were different. When doing the procedure in the Msi center it went down to 1% when the task manager showed me 100% spikes. Others, like Windows 10's Xbox Game Bar, showed no change.\nI've been doing some research on the subject, and what little information I found was contradictory. Some said it was normal and others that it was a mistake that needed to be treated. That's why I'm here on this subreddit even though my English is very bad.

I'm a little more advanced user than most and started utilizing some tools and dumps to see what was going on. Upon investigation I realized something was basically stopping Windows from working. I began to wonder what could be causing this. When I viewed the event log I was logging approx 1000 events a day within just a short period of time with the laptop on most of them being critical exceptions. Everything from security, software and administrative events. Trust me I've done all the suggested stuff all the way to fresh install. I got to thinking what I would have done when I worked in tech support. So I began going through all these logs and realized everything was being stopped from operating and executing. Only one thing I know of that does that and its security software. So I disabled my 3rd party firewall and enabled windows firewall and all is resolved. Not a single crash or exception in the event logs.\n\nCrazy. It seems that this may be a Windows issue and that they're are getting to a point where we have to rely on them for our security software.",

So a few years ago my dad smashed it on the ground, and it got the 'purple screen of death'; which basically mean the LCD liquid in the screen panel went all over the screen. I'm not too sure exactly but basically the screen does not work AT ALL. the phone itself is fine, and I am wondering how can I access it? What I'm trying to do is connect it to a PC and screen mirror it so I can access it through my PC. There is a problem though - I cant press the 'alllow PC to see phone storage'. So, I was wondering how could I get over this debugging issue, and juts plug it in my PC and able to access its files. also NO resesting it. Theres no point to that. Also, the screen mirroring app I was gonna use was 'scrcpy'. \n\nSo does anyone know how I could potentially fix this? Also I'm running windows 11. Also all i want to do is able to access the phone itself. I don't care about the actual phone just whats on it, like media, photos and data in apps. Oh and also the screen\\`\\`s buttons are basically done for. they don't work. if anyone needs any more information about this, please ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in conclusion, I need to know how to get connect the phones files to my PC and be able to transfer files without being able to accept the little notification staying 'allow PC to see files' cause the screen is broken.

    "text": "Hi all, having a strange issue with updating my setup: My desktop PC has  a 3060ti, normally connected to 2 monitors (2k165hz &amp; a 1080p60hz).  In the past I also had it connected via 15m hdmi cable to a 1080p tv in  another room, for playing games on the couch. I have since upgraded  that TV to a Hisense U7G55 4k screen, and so updated the hdmi cable to a  15m, 4k60 rated amplified cable running from my pc to the new TV. My pc  detects the tv fine, knows the brand, recommended resolution etc.  According to display panel, it is connected, I can even move my mouse  and windows off the monitor \"to\" it. HOWEVER the tv displays \"no signal\"  if the pc is outputting in anything higher than 1080p...  \n \n\nWhat I've done so far:  \n \\-Amplified cables are mono-directional. Triple checked that.  \n \\-disconnected every other screen except tv  \n \\-drivers are up to date   \n \\-cleaned and removed old drivers  \n \\-Tried multiple ports on tv and gpu  \n \\-restarted both pc and tv  \n \\-checked that all of the TV's ports are definitely 4k60 rated (2.1)  \n \\-consoles (XOne &amp; PS4) and both my partner's PC's (Win11/AMD570,  Win10/GTX1070) work fine in 4k60 via the same hdmi cable to the screen  \n \\-reinstalled windows  \n \n\nRegardless, it will always appear in nvidia &amp; windows display  settings (on my monitor) with whatever resolution I set, but will  display \"no signal\" on the tv unless it is in 1080p, and no higher than  60hz. Hopefully someone can help me with this obscure issue, I've yet to  find a solution online and I'm starting to go crazy haha &lt;3  \n \n\nRunning Windows 11, CPU R5 3600, GPU 3060ti, RAM 2x16gb DDR4, MSIx370.",

So 99\\`% of the time the UPS is silent and Im ok with it.  \nHowever, lately I've found that when the pc is stretched to the limit (while playing a very demanding video game), the UPS fan will start for a few seconds and then stop, every now and then while playing the game. So does it mean that the UPS is faulty, or is it ok for the fan to start a little while under heavy load? Or is a 660wats UPS isn't enough or my needs?",

    "text": "I\u2019m a bit confused about something. I\u2019ve been using two-factor authentication for a while now on all my important services after one of my accounts got hacked last year, and the type I prefer to use is the text message version of it. Recently I saw a video from a channel I respect (SomeOrdinaryGamers) that said that this is a very risky type of 2FA to use, since it\u2019s \u2018very if your SIM card gets hijacked\u2019. But isn\u2019t that a bit like planning on getting in a car accident AND struck by lightning on the same trip home? Not only would someone need to hack whatever service you\u2019re using and get a hold of your password, but they\u2019d also have to go through the Herculean (and very risky) process both figuring out who the random person whose password they got is, but also of convincing your phone provider that they\u2019re you and getting them to send a new SIM card, which is something pretty much all mobile providers (in Canada at least) take great lengths to prevent.\n\nSo this just seems extraordinarily unlikely to me. Sure it\u2019s possible, but like I said, it seems to me a little bit like expecting to get in an accident and then get struck by lightning. Possible, but not something you have any real reason to lose any sleep about. On the contrary though, using an App-based 2FA is risky in its own way, as I\u2019ve learned the hard way, since if whatever device you have the app on gets broken or needs to be reset, you won\u2019t be able to access any of the services until you contact them and have them disable the 2FA, which is a massive pain.\n\nLike, am I overlooking something here? \ud83e\udd14",

    "text": "I have a two story house with concrete walls. My ISP modem/router is one device and is plugged into an Ethernet (I think that's what it's called-looks like a phone jack) port in the wall. The wifi is perfect on this floor, where my tv is located, so streaming is not a problem.\n\n I also have two more ethernet ports/jacks upstairs in two of the bedrooms. The tv in the bedroom cannot stream at all because the signal isn't strong enough- I assume because of the concrete walls and floor. HOWEVER, when I move the modem/router and plug it into one of the bedroom ports/jacks, the tv works great there but I loose streaming downstairs. Moving the modem/router is easy.\n\nI've tried to find a central spot in the house where the cables? from the ethernet ports/jacks merge but I can't find anything. There is no basement or attic. \n\nMy question is: \n\nCan I purchase another router OR modem (which would be best?), plug it in to an unused ethernet port/jack on the other floor and connect it to the main modem/router provided by my ISP so I can stream on both floors? Would I need a modem or a router? How can I set it up so they \"talk\" to each other? \n\nI am not at all tech savvy so please, answer in plain English, no acronyms as I do not understand what those letters mean! \n\nI really hope someone can help me as it is driving me crazy!!",

    "text": "Okay I don't really know where to go with this question to here I am. \n\nBasically I use my laptop for literally everything, whether it's my classwork, my job, or anything else. I've ALWAYS used an ethernet connection as our internet here is completely unusable without it. I used it for about two years with no issues, moved out to go to college, came back, and suddenly I get this \"Unidentified Network\" issue anytime I try to use it.\n\nNow I tried all of these troubleshoot methods from all these sites and sources, and the ONLY thing I got to work was to run a bunch of commands in my Command Prompt. Commands like ipconfig /release,  ipconfig /renew, and netsh winsock reset,  netsh int ip reset. Now this actually worked miraculously! I was absolutely fine, but then another issue arose; NOBODY in the house could connect to our wifi. Literally nothing that wasn't plugged in directly (via ethernet) could connect. I had to go through an entire process to call our provider, reset all this stuff, and eventually we got everything working again, but my computer went right back to the \"Network Unavailable\" issue. \n\nSo seemingly the only thing that fixed my issue created this entire dilemma for everyone else in the house.  I'm no internet or tech aficionado, but should this even happen? How did fixing this issue on my computer BREAK the wifi in the entire house?? I just don't understand how this happened, and am now left with a basically useless computer that cannot connect to the internet at all. \n\nIf anyone has any advice, or reassurance as to how I could resolve this, I would appreciate it a ton. This is a short term issue now as I'm only here for a week, but come summer when I'm here for a few months, I (as sad as it is) cannot live with this issue for that long.",

The IT team said that the ethernet ports (of which there are 2 in all 50+ bedrooms, and who knows how many more in the common areas, conference rooms, and offices) are not connected because \"it is less secure and can be hacked.\" That is what they told the nurse on staff, from the employed, professional IT team.\n\nI like to think I'm a smart person and I'm interested when something doesn't make sense. This doesn't make sense. Do I call bullshit on the IT team?

    "text": " Hi  all, having a strange issue with updating my setup: My desktop PC has a  3060ti, normally connected to 2 monitors (2k165hz &amp; a 1080p60hz).  In the past I also had it connected via 15m hdmi cable to a 1080p tv in  another room, for playing games on the couch. I have since upgraded that  TV to a Hisense U7G55 4k screen, and so updated the hdmi cable to a  15m, 4k60 rated amplified cable running from my pc to the new TV. My pc  detects the tv fine, knows the brand, recommended resolution etc.  According to display panel, it is connected, I can even move my mouse  and windows off the monitor \"to\" it. HOWEVER the tv displays \"no signal\"  if the pc is outputting in anything higher than 1080p...\n\nWhat  I've done so far:\n-Amplified cables are mono-directional. Triple  checked that. \n-disconnected every other screen except tv\n-drivers are up to  date\n-cleaned and removed old drivers\n-Tried multiple ports on tv and gpu\n-restarted both pc and tv  \n-checked that all of the TV's ports are definitely 4k60 rated (2.1)  \n-consoles and both my partner's PC's (AMD570, GTX1070) work fine in 4k60 via hdmi to the  screen\n-reinstalled windows\n\nRegardless, it will always  appear in nvidia &amp; windows display settings (on my monitor) with  whatever resolution I set, but will display \"no signal\" on the tv unless  it is in 1080p. Hopefully someone can help me with this obscure issue,  I've yet to find a solution online and I'm starting to go crazy haha  &lt;3\n\nRunning Windows 11, CPU R5 3600, GPU 3060ti, RAM 2x16gb DDR4, MSIx370.",

    "text": "A few months ago, my computer would just completely shut off. Not restart, just black screen turn off. I eventually replaced my CPU to a Ryzen 5 5600X, and went from a Hard Drive To an M.2 SSD. Then I started getting BSOD\u2019s. They Seemed to be page fault in non pages area and Kernel events. I used a memory checker and the memory seemed to all be working well, although I replaced it to 32gb (2x16) 3600mHz Corsair RAM. I also replaced my PSU to a Corsair RM650. I still kept getting some BSOD\u2019s and instability, so I ended up using the commands to repair the registry, and all the recommended ones. I ended up fully reinstalling Windows (but keeping my Files), and eventually Fully reinstalled and reset Windows (took everything away and fresh installed it). This seemed to work, as I no longer got any blue screens or crashes of any sort. Until I finally got one that led to my computer boot looping and power cycling. I tried to enter Advanced Startup Settings, But I never could. Whenever I used a bootable USB (booted directly from it and changed boot order), I never could get any visual confirmations. I had for awhile major GPU artifacing which ended with me getting a new GPU, which led to me finally being able to see some errors whenever I tried to use a bootable USB or repair USB from Windows. The error said that Windows Failed to Start due to a missing file in the registry and to plug in installation media. I did, but whenever I got to the options it wouldn\u2019t let me boot into Safe Mode (It would Just restart the power cycle), and it never took me to the repair menu. I\u2019ve tried multiple USB\u2019s, I\u2019ve used RUFUS, and I\u2019ve used Aoemi\u2019s bootable media to no avail. My motherboard is the MSI MPG X570 Gaming Plus Mobo and I\u2019ve had it for a year and a half now, and I\u2019ve tried updating BIOS and downgrading via flashing, but to no avail. Whenever I try to go to the next BIOS up, it fails to update or flash, whenever I try to go to the latest bios, it also fails, so I end up having to go back to this current BIOS. At this point I\u2019m completely unsure of what to do now, or how else to fix it. I\u2019ve changed power cables, HDMI/DisplayPort cables, and the Motherboard\u2019s Bios seems completely fine. When I check temperatures within the BIOS, everything is at a normal temperature. I double checked to make sure all the cables were properly working. It just seems like in the middle of Windows repairing itself or loading, the screen goes black and the PC just restarts (unsure if it\u2019s just part of the boot loop, or if this is a power cycling problem). I can also see the Mobos Logo while it reboots. I Used the M.2 SSD checker and it verified there were no issues with the M.2 Drive. Before I had checked the memory and there were no issues (Ive also tried booting with only one stick and vice versa). I was also able to use Mem Test and it worked fine. The mobo detects the CPU just fine. I\u2019m honestly not sure what else is missing at this point.",

But today I decided to re-install windows with the option to keep my settings and apps due to a different bug that I was having in the settings option that I still haven't been able to fix. Well after completing the installation, I noticed some things in the network section on the file explorer were changed. I'm not sure what as I had changed a bunch of things just for the heck of it thinking it would provide extra security. \n\nI also downgraded from windows 10 enterprise to pro, though I tried doing the wireless connecting then but it didn't work. So it was obviously the re-install that probably fixed some corrupted files or reset some network settings.\n\nSo if you are getting the message \"miracast: available, no HDCP\" on the dxdiag file and also get HDCP capable on NVIDIA control panel then this fix would most likely also work for you.",

However, programs/apps that I had previously installed on a drive labeled D: (old drive letter), are now on the drive labeled C: (new drive), but windows still thinks they are on the old non-existent D: drive. I noticed this in the \"Programs and Features\" tab in the control panel where it shows you the locations of the apps.\n\nI've run into issues with reinstalling some apps, like the corsair icue4 app. Every time I try to use the uninstaller, it says that it can't find the files because it's still looking for it on my old D: drive. Most apps I've been able to run their installer and just install it to the new location on the C: drive where it's already at, and windows will be able to recognize it correctly.\n\nHowever, for apps that are causing issues like this, is there a way to manually change the location that Windows tries to look for them?

The only games I've had this issue with so far are Portal and TF2, as well as Spider-Man Web of Shadows (however it's not nearly as prominent with that game). As I said, it's very inconsistent as to when this happens; sometimes I can play for upwards of 3 hours before it freezes and completely softlocks, or it can be as little as about 3 minutes after booting up the game. The exact same thing also happens when I try to watch an HD Twitch stream on Chrome as well, and there's no pattern to that either.\n\nI posted about this issue on this sub about 3 weeks ago, but I only got one response saying it was probably a GPU issue, but even after updating my graphics drivers with official software, if anything, it made the issue slightly worse. For those wondering, though, I've got an AMD Radeon RX Vega 7 onboard GPU, so if it's typically an AMD Radeon problem or something, then there we go. I'm honestly desperate for a fix to this issue, so if anyone has any kind of idea for how to fix it, then please don't hesitate to comment.",

    "text": "So I'm kinda at a loss here. This isn't my first rodeo with Win10 but I don't even really know how to describe the issue in a why that's helpful aside from just giving a play by play, so here goes. Bear with me.\n\nFor a while now I'd occasionally get an issue while watching videos on YouTube, and YouTube only, where the video and audio would stutter and sorta, blend? Like it doesn't stop and start really fast it keeps playing just like it's getting chopped up, like when you talk into a fan. I chalked it up to connection issues since it only occurred while watching YouTube videos and my internet's notoriously fussy. But just now I noticed while watching a video and browsing some other tabs that the whole browser was lagging, and I thought I saw the mouse lagging as well but I couldn't tell for sure. A moment later I'm watching the video in fullscreen and the choppy lag thing occurs but this time it doesn't stop. The mouse starts clearly lagging and eventually the whole computer grinds to a hault. I can't ALT+TAB, WIN+TAB or CTRL+ALT+DEL. The screen fades, like it does when the window stops working, and the cursor changes to loading, but like everything else it's laggy and choppy. Not only after I get a little window in the upper left say \"Windows has stopped working\" with the option to force quit. I say no since I'm still hoping to salvage it but my only option is to force shutdown with the power button. I've since started back up and everything *seems* fine. I checked the event viewer, I have a custom log for errors, and it was hard to pick out anything that stood out aside from something labeled \"Kernal-Event Tracing: Session \"PerfDiag Logger\" stopped due to the following error: 0xC0000188\" like most Window's error logs there wasn't really anything helpful on google.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had an issue yesterday upon starting the computer where my keyboards lighting didn't turn on. I unplugged the USB and plugged it back in, which caused the keyboard to light up but also caused my mouse to temporarily freeze. The mouse came back after booting the Logitech G software that it uses, which of course also froze momentarily. (I really hate Logitech G Hub, it's caused me nothing but problems)\n\nMy leading suspicions are:Some issue with my graphics driver\n\nAn issue with Chrome/YouTube specifically, the problem only occurs while watching videos with this combo of browser and website\n\nAn issue with Logitech G Hub. I'm not really sure how it would cause this but the software's so buggy and terrible I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nA deeper motherboard/BIOS issue. The only reason I suspect this is because a while back, around December, I updated my BIOS to prepare for Windows 11. I still haven't installed 11 but ever since the update post times have been unusually long, the PC always ends up booting and I can get into the BIOS just fine but it takes far longer than it did on previous BIOS versions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf nothing else works I'm praying that this is just a Win 10 issue and that maybe updating to 11 will leave the problem in the past but I'd really like to know something more concrete first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Spelling",

But mostly used for videos or Facebook  \n\n\n\\*\\*Have and have not's\\*\\*  \n\\- I have dropped this phone several times. But I always had it on a case. But I did not drop it recently as the issue happened  \n\\- I have not submerged this on water since noticing the back started to become peelable.  \n\\- I only had 1 third party app installed. It was a reputable game I downloaded back in 2020. It cannot do any auto updates. And it was from it's official site  \n\\- I only always visited one \"shady\" free streaming site on Chrome. \"Kimcartoon. li\". It only usually just do popups that only opens in \"new tab group.\" which I would just immediately close. It had not attempted to download anything. Worst it's done is redirecting to an Official online Shop like \"Shopee\" or \"Lazada.\" I had my \"Safe Browsing\" set to \"Enhanced protection\"  \n\\- I had it on the latest software update on February 22, 2022  \n\n\n\\*\\*Additional questions\\*\\*  \nIf this is an issue of software or program. What would be the cause of this? and how do I fix it?  \n\n\nIf this is a hardware issue. Apart from the LCD that I'm probably gonna have to replace, what parts would be a factor for this issue? And how do I determine or enumerate whether or not \\*these\\* certain parts are the cause?",
