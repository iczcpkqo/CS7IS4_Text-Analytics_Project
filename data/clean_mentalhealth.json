    "text": "Well. recently did syc ward the second time, but i had to leave because i would've had to go into quarantine for a week. I couldn't take it after 2 hours and went home the next day. Now, I just have to get my shit together and go to school because my parents threatened to sell my dog if i So now i just mute everything by barely sleeping or eating. Alcohol seems way easier but i really don't want to loose my dog so yeah, i just drag myself to school and back home, don't eat till afternoon and go to sleep at 3 Happy_face_smiley . 0am. I have to get up at 6am. Everyone seems to think i'm fine since i really try to maintain that guys can count on me, i've got and i don't get hurt unless it's broken or bleeding I kinda got rid of that till i noticed that nobody even cared how i was feeling, not even my therapist. She decided to show me pictures of past selfharm wounds ( it used to be much worse last year around this time according to everyone around me) and even after i told her i didn't want to see it since it would trigger the hell out of me she showed that to me anyways. I was a wreck for the rest of the day. A few days after that ( it could've been weeks, i just live in a constant blur) i got a different therapist that is closer to where i live and all she did was listen to what my parents think i feel like and then told me well just go to So i just decided to not give a fuck anymore and just started to early sleep so i couldn't think straight. At least i can go to school like this, which means i'll keep my dog. But i'm scared that she'll be gone one day and that i leaned too much on her again, just like i did with my grandmother. Everything just seems to slip away to the point that when i sleep i dream that all of what i have would just be gone and there would be no teachers that cheerfully great you every moving, no dog that wakes you up while linking through your face, and no friends that are just as chaotic as i am. I can't see these things as good, but i'd sure be a whole lot more miserable if i wouldn't have to pretend for someone. I'm starting to loose stuff already though. I can't really play guitar anymore, neither can i sing or anything like that. I can't even cry, and i tend to be really dizzy a lot of the time. I constantly look behind me in bathrooms and stuff because i'm scared of something. I can't quite realize what i'm scared of, but i'm scared of something to the degree of fuck it, just get out of And it's been the same for two years. From age 13 to 15. That's quite a lot to me. And it's a lot that's gone, people i lost, i took for granted, would've wanted to say goodbye to. Maybe at least cried at the funeral. Or at least coped with it. I still don't really get that i won't return to my grandma and that she won't make soup and vanilla pudding with berries. And i hate myself for it. I hate myself for not being able to remember her face, her voice, the house i had so many great moments in that i can't really recall. All i can remember is that i said that grandma could make it because it was only a bit of a cough. Her lungs collapsed. I never saw her again. I couldn't say goodbye. To one of my nearest humans i could never say that i loved her, she couldn't see me be an adult, be a teen. I would've loved to have her by my side through this. ",

However, my girlfriend just told me she's leaving me and moving out.

I'm having a hard time and trying to figure out what to do to move on with my life. I don't have anymore close family except for older brother and I'm definitely going to spend some time with him in coming weeks. I was renting a flat with my girlfriend and I really do not think I will be able to live here without suffering she's not here anymore been together/living for years). Additionally we've been expats where I am now, I have barely any friends here. How to move on? How to at least relief a bit next episode of my mental suffering? I literally finished mental help sessions a few weeks ago and I'm not ready for another struggle in life.

I'm a ex art/CT student who enjoys the daily spliff and the biyearly mushroom trip. That's all the drugs that I use, no alcohol etc. I'm a security technician at a mental hospital: i keep the doors of the isolation units locked, the cameras, fire alarm, gas, intrusion, covid van temps. All kinds of random stuff, the environment is sucked because it's consist of people: people condemned by society basically. Anyway my problem:. Since almost a year now I have been having random attacks. I start to feel cold, my mind freezes, becomes unable to think. On which I need to sit down. After 5-6 mins it's over and I'm covered in sweat and don't remember anything about what could have caused it or what I thought during it. I went to do the brainscan, had to wait 4 months for that. But on the day of the scan my brain crashed a few times(it was really bad in this period) and I forgot the papers for the scan, because I didn't have the papers they didn't let me in, and made fun of me for forgetting them. Needless to say i felt sucked and didn't make a new appointment. Please what the fuck is happening to my brain. Im not dependent on my job because I live with my parents still so there is no pressure on the job. My job life consists of constant emergencies so maybe that won't help. Today it happened while I was just chilling in my desk chair, doing nothing. Please please help, the doctors are just prescribing some sucked sedatives and I know those won't help. ",

I'm still a minor and can't afford a therapist so the only emotional support I have is my parents. They initially tried to help me when these feelings of inadequacy first started (a few years ago), but now they've grown tired of me and just dismiss this. I honestly can't blame them. I'm a pathetic wreck of a human being, even at such an early age. Every minute of my life is spent obsessively comparing myself to my peers in one way or another. It's a losing battle. People will always say can never know what someone's going through, don't wish to be someone but that's bullcrap. Just by looking at my classmates I can tell nobody is nearly as screwed up in the head as me. While everyone else is vibrant and cheerful, I'm the kid who always sits alone silently obsessing over my inadequacy and myself in general. I can see the pity in their eyes when they approach me. My mindset is that life is some sort of competition to be won. Whether it's academic performance, social status, appearance I tend to believe that determines my value. Most people who think like this only apply these standards to themselves. Not me though. I've sunken so deep into this toxic mindset that whenever I feel inadequate, I like to think about people who have it worse than me to cheer up. I have an insatiable desire to be idolized by people. I don't have any diagnosed mental disorders but I suspect Maladaptive Daydreaming. I've spent hours every day fantasizing about stuff for 10 years now. It started out as harmless fantasies via which I would escape reality, but now it's just obsessively thinking about this perfect version of myself I badly grave to be. Yet I know I never will. I fantasize about my family and friends describing how proud they are of my idealized self. Sad story, I know. Although I might have an idea of where this all started. Growing up, I developed much faster than my peers on an intellectual level. I won't get into too much details but I was used to constant praise for everyone. My parents would even go as far as mocking other perceived inadequacies as a way to compliment me. Then I grew up, got a good look at myself, realized I'm not this demigod I was made out to be and fell into a hole i never got out of. I believe this is what you call Gifted Kid Syndrome. How do I put a stop to this obsession? Ever since I got my reality check a few years ago, I've felt miserable because my standards remain insanely high. I can't even imagine a day without comparing myself to someone, much less living like that. It's absolute torture. It's been getting way worse over the past month, so much so that I started feeling constant chest tightness and shortness of breath that gets unbearable when I'm stressed. You know it's bad when you're a teenager and your mental health is so messed up you can't breathe properly. And yes, I went to several doctors. Got all kinds of tests done and nothing seems to be wrong. All of them chalk it up to stress. If I don't get my brain to function like that of a normal human being, it might end up being the death of me. Therapy is off the table since we can't afford that kind of thing. Parents don't want to listen to me complain which is understandable. I'm way too big of an arrogant and self-centered price to let go of my impossible standards. What to do? ",

That's our typical holiday. We also are very very frugal and we have no hobbies (no pay To, nothing like videogame, sport relative stuff, etc. ) in order to save much money as possible. Usually after daughter fall asleep I was able to painting or drawing. This is my only time for myself. My wife doesn't fully understand hobby but she understand art so she is ok with this. I can manage this situation but things start changing some months ago. My wife hit a stressful 8 hr/week upgrade course and for that reason she ask since October to work only 12 hr (she still earn more than me btw). She also have multiple tests every 2/3 months that she can't fail. I'm doing my best to support her, but since last month she stop cleaning our house, we have a mount of unfolded clothes and 3-4 times at week she ask me to doing the dishes. I'm ok with this and washing dishes and folding clothes but I simply have no energy for also cleaning our house that is a real mess. But everyday my wife complaint about how messy and dirty is our house and usually start a small fight for this reasons. Also work is not going good for me. In the last three years a guy from my department try to make me in trouble and robbed me, but I'm usually very accurate in my work and can avoid most of his traps. He also count everytime I go to the toilet and things like this (I had to stop drink at work). After Christmas holiday my only office coworkers (senior engineer) get covid and he was out for 3 weeks and I had to do his stuff, things that I never manage previously still a junior engineer cause I previously work in a very different field). In the same time we are submerged by work. Our engineer department is very small and my company usually subcontract 80/90% of this stuff to other companies. But cause covid crisis we lost three of our bigger contractors and company are struggling to find new ones and I and coworkers are going to work plus hours and also often on saturday. Everything is an Ok, we work in automotive sector (basically only HE) and we know we can't fail a deadline but is very stressful. So in the last weeks I apparently lost my accuracy. I think maybe is the Mt. Stupid of Running-Kruger effect so I start to control everything 2/3 times like I'm the new guy but I'm simply unable to see errors. Not big errors, but stupid small errors that can cause a lot of problems. I also doing stupid things at home, like spill oil in glass and water in salad during dinner, put sugar instead of coffee in coffee machine and prepare milk bottle and give it to my wife instead of toddler. So today coworkers and boss have a meeting. Cause coworkers reprimanded me in the morning for one of that errors I sincerely think I'm going to pass some bad time. But coworkers lately said to me that tomorrow he's going to teach me how to design new by zero. My work is usually repair and upgrade/modify this machine, he's the one who design that. Then he explained he usually design one of those is a 3/4 weeks process but this time are test machines and we have to design one of them in 2 days (then test department use that for some trial and throwaway). Company asked us to design barely 100 different test machine with max priority. We I return home I start to have some nervous tic like when I was a chid and fell some panic attack symptoms (last time I have one of this was 4 years ago). I think I'm experiencing some sort of pre burn out symptoms and I don't know what to do. ",

Hard working, a carpenter/painter, built our life with his hands from little to middle class and not having to worry about anything. Long story short is he is a great person but the worst of all is all the things i wont get to show him. My wife and i went traditional with the marriage thing and moved in on our wedding day. So not only was Dad unable to see our wedding but all the little things that us guys do around the house to make things nicer for us and our wife. I have this overwhelming urge to just show him stuff and give him a hug and make him proud and make him happy through seeing me do things. I wanna show him the children we plan to have i wanna show him. this. that. i want his hug and his voice and to hear him annoyingly barge in for just a hug and to see what im doing. This is affecting my work. Im an HAC tech so concentration breaks can double how long it takes me to come to a conclusion or make me miss obvious things. My train of thought was broken up a lot today and i cried and felt bad on the way home cause service manager was just calling in to remind me of something i should have brought up at the calls for the day. He wasnt mad cause im only 1 year in. At the time i was considering telling him i wasnt feeling well but id. Should i just take this as a bad day and try to do better tomorrow? . Its affecting my motivation to take care of my health as well. Should i talk and workout with my old gym bro who lost his mom some few years ago? . How much easier do things get over time?

I am currently sleep deprived and havent slept in 40+ hours due to staying up doing a university assignment alongside my uni friend. To try and combat my tiredness throughout today I had 2 Starbucks iced coffee which I later found out had so much caffeine in. I dont usually have caffeine but didnt think it would effect me differently to when I do have it. But when I got home after a long day of university work, my head began to feel a slight pressure and my peripheral vision went a bit blurry. I started getting a lot of random thoughts coming out of nowhere and the sudden urge to continuously talk to someone about nothing important at really. I kept repeating myself several times and got very agitated for seemingly no real reason and kept walking around the room being way more talkative than usual. I felt really off, like I couldnt control how often I spoke and what I was talking about.

    "text": "(tw: suicide, depression, school/grades). The first year of university is supposedly where most students get their PA as high as possible because it is one of the easiest year and courses are all introductory. However, I am genuinely struggling so much and not because I can't grasp the concepts in classes, but I am mentally struggling so much and I am so tired. For years, I've always struggled with my mental health. Finally started therapy last summer and is still working through it. But at the end of the day, it's just me, myself and I who can really deal with the constant war and battle inside of my head and I am so tired, drained and burnt out. During my first semester, my online best friend took her own life and I fought so hard to get through the semester with decent GPA. Spent the semester break grieving and still am now into semester two, but doing somewhat better with the grief. I still talk to her in my thoughts a lot to replace the conversations I would usually have with her. I would be lying if I hadn't thought about joining her several times, but her last words to me is that she wanted me to live life for her because she . My second semester is switched back to online, which I don't mind in all honesty because I really needed the time to be with myself. However, I'm struggling so much to focus and for some reason, all my assignments for different courses are cramped up together and I'm in the middle of my midterm right now and I feel so burnt out. I have two exams left, one in a few hours and I barely studied for it, nor have I been listening for the last few lectures because I'm constantly so tired and I can't seem to focus because all I wanna do is just rest. I am trying my best to work on myself and honestly, have moved forward plenty, but why am I struggling so much with my first year of university where everything's supposed to be the easiest? How am I even supposed to complete my four year degree? Constantly feel like I am on the verge of an attack because I really want to do well in school, especially in university, but why is it so hard. It doesn't help the fact that my anxiety constantly makes me feel like the whole world is crumbling down on me and I gotta spend the rest of my life living with whatever mistakes I made and ruined my life for. And I know I'm not supposed to compare, but I see other students who are struggling in their own ways too, but still get good grades. And it makes me wonder, maybe my problem is just laziness, but I swear I am trying what I can say the best I have in the moments of time, but still, I end up constantly feeling like a failure and that I may never succeed in anything. The reason I want good grades is because I really just want to do well in university and graduate first honour, if not second honour - first division. I went through high school aiming for average and now I want to aim for higher because I somehow got myself into a good university and I don't want to fuck this up, but I think I am. I have spent the last couple of years in my life thinking I wouldn't make it into the next, and now that I am at a place where I used to think would just be a dream or a very far-reach goal, is right here, right in-front of me, I want to do it as well as possible. For anyone who read it this far, thanks. Just really needed a place to vent. Thank you for reading. Hope you have an amazing day. ",

Today, they are our first choice for treating not only depression, but severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder both in adults and children. However, in 2004 the DA came out with a black box warning for a potential for increased suicidal thinking in adolescents and children. As a result, for a period of time, prescriptions of SSRIs went down for this population, and death by suicide went up. Talking about this can be difficult for clinicians who prescribe the medications and frightening for the patients and the families, but a good informed consent discussion can be very effective and helpful.

    "text": "Hi, has anyone else here have issues keeping contact to people, bonding with people and overall having almost no interest in relationships/friendships? I do get lonely at times but I worry more about what other people might say or think about me, I don't want to be seen as a lower who has no friends or social life (even though that's exactly the case). I'm perfectly fine being alone. I do enjoy being around people and having fun etc but I lose interest quickly and prefer to live in my own fantasy world (listening to music, watching videos/movies, having fantasy relationships with actors/anime characters and so on). It got so bad that sometimes I have trouble leaving my house for work because I absolutely have no interest in engaging with people at times or just want to relax at home and not go outside. On my day offs and free time I choose to have no single contact to others, I take AES to respond back in text which makes people think I have no interest in them. I had social anxiety in the past but I worked through it by going outside and forcing myself to be social. I'm not scared of people anymore. Can anyone relate? ",

    "text": "I'm a 28M. Some days, but often, when I go to bed I tend to have suicidal thoughts (just at night, before sleep when I lie on the bed). Sometimes I in pain. It's always the same thing, about how I should do it, drown myself, jump from a high place, etc. Basically me having really bad thoughts. Sometimes I wish I was disabled so I wouldn't need to care of my own life. Other times bad thoughts do not happen and I just tend to fantasize over sexual stuff until I fall asleep. Here's the thing, I'm not sure I'm suicidal, I've never tried to hurt myself or kill myself. I am probably thinking it, but I don't mean it(? ). I also don't have the guts, and I would need to be mentally ill to do it. I do think, that in my current state, if things won't get better in (to change my life for the better) it will deteriorate my mental health again. I also myself to do my life if I would fail again. However, if you were asking me right now if I'm willing to die, I would say yes, just as I find my life beyond this point meaningless and do not fit to what life . I have anxiety, but I never considered it major. I also take medicine/pills regular in the morning against anxiety, and they might wear off after a few hours, but I don't think they are the cause. During the day, most of the time I won't have bad thoughts, unless a (bad) event of sort happened and then my anxiety kicks in and I would become depressed for some time until it goes off. But otherwise my life are pretty normal. I would like to know how can I deal with those thoughts. I would like to make my life better, but I can't change who I am. I can't get of my comfort zone and my habits. I just like to sit in front of the computer day, and it is just something enjoy. It's not social, I know. I would like to be more social, but I am not that kind of a person either. Do I like other things? sure. Gym was fun. Playing and creating music is fun. But I can't get into habits of doing them. I always fail making them a habit. As an example: I do love mindfulness meditation which might help, but after a 2-3 days I can't keep it up and just stop doing it (without any reason). It ends out my life are rather meaningless and empty, and I might have desire to change it but I can't act on it. I have considered a life a failure so far, and it always follows the same cycle. I want to have some confidence in my life, a place I'm comfortable with, which I don't have. I always dropped from jobs I didn't like because of working times as an example. I just couldn't find a normal daily job (and I am still struggling finding one). My moral goes down and I don't even search for a proper job. I would like to know especially about my suicidal thoughts, where those may appear from and why I have them only at night, how can I deal with them and think more posivitely so I can change my life for the better.

No more thought, no more sight, hearing, smell, taste or feeling, just nothingness. I've talked to people before and they've described my fear as a fear of the unknown but it's not, it's a fear of the unknowable. I don't know if there is alien life elsewhere in the universe but it doesn't keep me up at night like the knowledge that I will one day just not exist. Like not even darkness, less than our idea of nothing because our idea of nothing still has conscious thought. This will be like before we were born, just nothing. The absence of anything. I would rather any idea of Hell. Endless pain, misery and torture would at least have me able to experience it. I think therefore I am, but after I die I won't think therefore I will not be. And the worst thing is, there is nothing I can do to stop it. It doesn't matter if I was to become the richest, most powerful human in all of history, I would still die. Even if I managed to extend my life to billions, hell even, nonillions of years old I would still one day die when the universe ends. But that's pretty much impossible so I have, at best 70 years left, but most likely around 30-40 years left. I can't stop it, no one can. But everyone acts like it's okay, that not existing anymore isn't a fate worse than literally anything else in the universe.

I've ruined my life, and id if I can fix it. Ive been contemplating on things I would never do like drugs or suicide. Like I said I would never do them, but they're so tempting just to ease the pain, but I haven't done those things because I know better, but now I'm a little scared because before even if I wanted to kms I didn't really have the means to do so. I could have taken a bunch of pills, but if I didn't take enough I would be in the hospital in pain. I could crash my car, but what if I hurt someone else.

I'm not really looking forward to my birthday. the thought of being an adult and being expected to go on to the new chapter of my life scares me. what if I don't meet those expectations?

I feel like I failed at life. id how to help myself, other than to hurt myself until I get sht done. I know The only person who can help me is myself, all I ask from this forum is advice on how to help me help myself.

I'm good at talking to friends and family but even just being near strangers throws me off, I just get all self-conscious and panicky. Unfortunately I've only covered a bit of my problems so far.

I have severe mood swings that I alternate between and you really just don't know what you're getting each day I wake up. I'll go into a bit more detail here by addressing the main mood swings I go through. Introversion, the most common one probably. I feel a lot more relaxed when I'm just in my on company and I stick to my creature comforts. The idea of change gives me anxiety when I'm like this and I rarely get bored of entertaining myself. I still talk to people but have less tolerance for it and much prefer to do it all online. Something of a wet blanket, very insecure and crying isn't all too rare. The clown (i like this one). I try forcing myself not to care about what other people think too much, do dumb shit and always crack jokes or sarcastic remarks to keep things light-hearted. Usually dry, but I easily get gregarious when I'm comfortable. Occasionally troll people as well with dumb lies and such. Feminine side. Pretty self explanatory. I often regret doing the things I do when I'm in this mood. Selfish count. I get mad when things don't go how I want them to and I just barely care about anything. I also somewhat change how I talk to people depending on who they are, talking to certain people makes me more in touch with one side than the others. ",

    "text": "(19, M) I am falling into a deep depression. I was depressed before--I even attempted (I added the link to a post I made about it if you want the details) last Monday. I was doing better for a while. I even felt like that, even though I'm in a worse place now than I was when I wanted to take my life. Now, I'm not suicidal, but I am depressed. I feel sad, lethargic, and pathetic. I can't concentrate on my work, I'm not sleeping well, and I keep finding myself signing and telling myself just don't care even though there's a part of me screaming that I do care. Having this mindset is detrimental to me. Just a couple weeks ago I was laser-focused on my fitness and it was beginning to pay off but now I've been eating junk and even though I want to go to the gym I don't seem to have the will to get up and go there. I know if I don't do something soon that the consequences of my behavior will compound my misery and then I'll really plummett. It's tough to do the things that make me feel happy though. I'm staying in a room with no exterior windows only illuminated by artificial light. I can't leave it though because I'm doing my classes virtually now and I don't want to bother (or be bothered by) my family. Tuesday and Thursday are especially difficult because I have two back-to-back classes that total 3 hours in lens--three hours of sitting in this room. Everyone in my life (physically speaking) has been reduced to my aunt, uncle, and cousin. I'm trying to get involved with things where I'm at but there's nothing here. I'm also very stressed because I'm behind on my assignments but I just don't have the will to do them and every day my backlog becomes even more insurmountable. On top of that, finals are in two weeks. I can't take a leave of absence because then I'd have to repeat my classes and I'm almost finished with them and I must have them for my major. I know all of my issues are being caused by my depression but they are also prolonging it and intensifying it. I want I want to get better. I'm getting clinical care but not for 8 more days. I have an anti-depressant that I'm taking but it's not helping. I need to save myself because no one else can. I need to counteract the thoughts and behaviors that my depression has caused because they are causing my depression! If I don't do something today, I'll be in a deeper hole tomorrow. I don't think I can wait 8 days just to start some intensive therapy. I swear, I'm not suicidal I'm terrified I'm going to fuck up my life more. How do I walk up this downward escalator? How do I put the wind in my sails to get out of my hole? Please help. Thank you. ",

However, I made it out. I kind of wish I had a therapist or something so I could recognize how I did it but I'm out and I know how to be happy again. But now I can feel some things slipping. I'm currently going through some work and academic stress. Nothing that I haven't gone through in the last two years when I felt like I was doing well. What's scaring me is that I can see some of the symptoms of my depression coming back. One of the most persistent parts of my depression was intrusive just constantly replacing events that felt humiliating over and over again. I don't know if it's the stress, or the fact that I smoked up a lot a few days ago or what it is, but the intrusive thoughts are back. I can tell that I'm feeling low. And my brain is attacking me again. I'm so upset I could cry. I don't want to go back there again. During the last two years, even if stressful things happened I could brush it off and move on. The intrusive thoughts haven't happened in so long. I just want to know if I can fight this right now so I don't have to go through it all over again. I also don't know if this is but I ending up doing a lot of weed at a friend's party less than a week ago. I haven't done weed in months and even then I always did it in moderation. This time it was beyond that. I can't pinpoint anything so I'm wondering if it's possibly the marijuana. If it is, will I still be Of? ",

Attendance 100% (sounds crazy I know, no sick day leave during my first year), Sophomore made temporary friends but I used to act like they should tell me where they are going or at least include me during talks. Things turned out weird during my first half of pre-final year. No one was there whom I could talk with or even just eat food with. Downloaded a app To (short name of that app) where people were dating instead of mental health help and sometimes complaining that everyone are mess. Physically attributes were judged and I didn't had idea about it. Met a guy who was 30 and lived 5 hours away from my city. He was another mess and don't want to go in detail but turns out he was rude and just needed a guy who was perfect for him. I got emotionally attached to him because I had no one to talk and thought I love him. Fool me. After 15 and till today had 3 minor and 3 major life threatening surgeries. The recent surgery was 8 months back and after that I have constantly writing long texts to my dad that he is responsible for bad genetics and bad parenting and he threw me to other city, forcing me to do the degree what he demands. For mom I broke tea cups whenever she told something which was just a normal talk. After 2-3 days I become normal and jolly. Then my mood changes that I need to take revenge from that 30 y/o (now 32) guy that why he disrespected me and instead of helping for job reference mocked that I just hide behind my surgeries instead of facing the problem. Like an open heart surgery at the age of soon-to-be 22 was a normal thing back then! Now, again I am happy and talking inside that Yeah I forgive this guy. Same goes for parents, but now I feel like I should live my life for revenge instead of focusing on my dreams. Suddenly, I'm happy and jumping in joy. I am kept inside my home always and being watched whom I'm texting with or talking with.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I (17m) have very very high functioning dysthymia and general anxiety. Grew up in a no excuses type of family that believes mental health issues aren't real. In all honestly having this foundation greatly aided me. Having it in my mind that despite whatever I feel I can do anything I want has allowed me to more or less not be a victim of my conditions. Continuing my latter high level athlete, well above average grades and so forth. Going on 6 or so years with anxiety and depression that renders me unable to interact socially and driven to self harm and suicide. This where the high functioning part comes in. A couple of years ago a bad breakup sent me off the deep end. suicide and eating disorder bad. My response was chronic work relating to my specific sport, overall intensive exercise and overachieving in school. I had some really good older guys I met through my sport that showed me work being an outlet for whatever emotional shit you're afflicted by (I know not the wealthiest but if it works it works right? ) That was really the start of my obsession with self improvement. At the time I viewed self improvement as a remedy to all mental ailment. I picked up on meditation for a while and all the corresponding self care shit. I was genuinely in a good place for a while. Following tearing a nerve in my back I was damn near bed ridden in physical condition. Determined to play through it, I sucked myself up worse. To try to keep things concise I was pretty much a physical shell of a person for 2 years. All the things that elevated my conditions, I was suddenly unable to do. All mental ailments I previously stated came flooding back fitting into my head and that empty cavity of chest like a sadistic puzzle piece. The feeling was uncanny to what I had felt that earlier part of my life. Did I not get better? I mediated, I journaled my feelings and dreams, I learned how to understand and control my subconscious, I tried my very best to become a person fully capable of being happy alone. What happened? I did what I was supposed to do? Why doesn't all this shit leave? . Conclusion:. I didn't write this to tell you all that there is not light at the end of the tunnel. The longer I live the more I start to believe that specifically for me there is no light at the end, but I learned that light does exist in some capacity. Ive been sucked up for so long I genuinely don't believe sustained happiness exists but im not set on killing myself. I know shit will get better because it has. I know I will live with everything I've been through forever. Every friend I've lost, every betrayal, every disappointment. But that's ok I guess. That shit's apart of who I am. I know for as long as I've known turmoil when I finally experience peace it will greatly be cherished. That's a gift in a way, for the rest of my life it will be impossible to not appreciate the good in it. Not appreciating this short life we have is the greatest disservice. Edit:. I didn't even think this would end positive, I genuinely started writing this suicidal. That's how quick you see that light in life,. Love yours. ",

    "text": "This might not be fitting here, but I have recently watched an anime (My Dress Up Darling), which had this amazing, realistic love scene, where there was lots of tension and intimacy and I just absolutely loved it. However, shortly after, I started feeling crushed, because it was such a perfect moment and everything that led up to it was perfect. Their friendship, their awkwardness, both of the character's good will. I started feeling heartbroken over it, since it was so good, I start feeling like I won't ever feel that way in life, therefore I want to stay in it for a long time. It's so sweet and beautiful and it always breaks my heart thinking about such perfection for some reason. A similar thing happened to me with One Piece. The emotions that I felt watching the perfect life, full of travel, fun, friends, but also sacrifice, struggle and grief, just made it so real for me. And My Dress Up Darling has that realness aspect too. That's why it's so hard to get over, since everything seems plausible. One Piece now doesn't after thinking a bit. You have to work and there is beauty in work, you can't always travel. But Dress Up Darling is different, it's two high-school students who slowly fall in love with each other, everything through being kind to one another and sharing their passions. It's realistic. Of course the author created it to be perfect, but it still doesn't take away the fact that it can happen in real life. So the problem is, I can't focus on work because of this. While I'm writing this, distracting myself on reddit, instagram, twitter (also, I can't watch videos and I find it hard to watch other anime for some reason, because I want to just indulge in that perfect one and watching others just feels wrong, but some give me comfort), out running errands or spending time outside, communicating and talking to other people, I'm feeling great actually, but when I return to my room and I have to work again, it's like the standards of a fictional reality hit me and I cannot focus. I start feeling heartbroken over a perfect story and characters that I want to indulge in, and I because a new episode comes out Sunday and because I've got lots of work to do. I know that I should give it time and just focus on my life, hobbies, family, friends. And I start my days off right, I take a cold shower, I mediate, I stretch, I make breakfast, but these thoughts of this perfect love life that give me heartbreak start lingering on my mind from the moment I wake up and even if I forget them, they come back. I love spending time with these thoughts, since the thing that happened in the anime is positive, even though it crushes me. I kinda love sadness, spending time to get over it (for example walking, spending time near a river, being with friends, doing sports) but I can't do it while I'm at work. So yeah. I've gotten some great advice on r/anime, but I also wanna know what you guys think. What could help me get over this as organically as possible, so I can continue working? Thanks! ",

My dad is now 65, my mom, 42. Since they now each have their own families, I transfer from house to house for them to share parenting duties. For both sides of the family, I am the eldest - although my parents never pressure me, I just know all the responsibility and expectations of success are on me. Thus, all my life, I've been a hardworking student. At 11, I got a full scholarship to the premier high school in our country and had to move out alone and live in a dorm since it was provinces away from my hometown. Now at 16, I'm preparing papers to move out of the country ALONE since I just got a full scholarship to an international boarding school. Since the pandemic, I've come to realize and have come to terms that I'm alone. But now that I'm about to leave the country in a few months, I'm facing the same loneliness again - even worse. I guess I just realized that all these years I think I matured too fast. I never got to fulfill my childhood much because I've always been bustling. Always been calculating the next classes to take, what grades to get, what awards to achieve. And while my parents never forced me to excel (they even tell me it's okay to have average grades as long as I'm rested), I feel like I'm just also unconsciously in a rush to finish my degree, pursue my goals, and make a home of my own, whatever home may be, because all my life I felt like I never truly had one. I want to talk about it to my close friends but I don't think they'd be interested enough or just wouldn't understand the bearings of it. Plus they have their own baggage to carry anyway. I want to tell my mom, - my bestest friend, my reason, my inspiration - but I don't want her to feel like it's her fault or that she's a bad mother or that she's not good enough of a mother. I just wish I had someone to talk to. Someone to pour it all to because I just honestly feel so lonely. ",

So like 2 months being alone and then im done with school for this year. They arent going to miss me they are happy that i will be gone i know that. I feel lonely as fuck and after when i got sad h where like u okay? I skipped it because i know h only ask for me and not for himself like yes h care about me but also not. H did care but now not anymore. I did move on but like this shit pulls me back like we broke up so where not going to talk normal again huh. I see how tommorow will be if its the same then id i Just hope thats tommorow is better. The only goddam reason i did try everything to Come to school was because of him. Like week ago i got mad at People because i wanted to go to school eventually h wasnt there. But still i rather have that im on school and h isnt then im at home and hs on school. Hs special to me not in relation but like as a kinda friend. Id what we are now sometimes it feel like where strangers sometimes it feels like where friends and sometimes it feels like where a couple. Or when we are outside where like couple and then at home where strangers like wtf i dont get it anymore. I care about him very much and like i want to give him money and all. Yes a good person hs kind, sweet, carefully and so much more good things but like i dont want us to be strangers. But h keep pushing me away and then h try to care but i know h doesnt. Maybe a little bit i feel so fuck up i cry again lmaz. I Just feels like i lose the Most important person. Id what to do anymore like if i ask him if h hates me h say no but then h skip me and on school he Just act like i dont life. Its the same feeling what i got at my old house. Nobody cares and that im Just a ghost for them. That all i need to do is sit still and look pretty. Smile when i want to cry. Keep on being strong when i wanna fall apart. I Just want him to hug me again like before before we got something like Just careless and doesnt care what others think. I can only have his touches from others feel is so fuck up. But by him it feels save and soft. But prolly asking for hugs are to much asking for talking is to much. H did say him himself i have let him done shit what h didnt wanted to do. But h didnt tell me that h didnt wanted it. Like i feel so fuck up and then seeing him Smile makes me happy but also its like i never did make you happy. H also told me that that the only thing i gave him was pain. Im a bad girlfriend im sorry. ",

Under this time I was put on four different SSRIs (Sertralin, Citalopram, Mirtazapin and Trintellix), one mood stabilizer (Lamictal) and sleeping pills (Zopiclone and Promethazine). Through this testing of medication Ive acquired some very unpleasant long term effects in the form of a constant feeling of uncontrollable rage (never had this issue before), constant pain in head and face and a hypersensitivity to mens that are able to pass the blood brain barrier.

Fast forward 10 years, he's mellowed out but lately he's grown obsessed over the thought of migrating and living the good life in another country. Five years ago, I had plans to work overseas, though I am not interested in migration. In recent years, my mental state has deteriorated and I don't care much for this past dream anymore, though it has remained his. However, I have a feeling not trying my hand at work in another country will be a regret later in my life, not too big of one but it may still be nonetheless. He has been begging me to take the TOEFL/ILETS test for months and has been increasingly angry at me for not taking action. What he doesn't know is the more he forces me, the more I don't want to do anything he wishes. If he weren't in the picture, and I were in a better state of mind, I would go for it. But I can't help feeling tremendously angry, frustrated, confused and resentful. It's stopping me from even taking the damn test.

There was a while when I thought I was improving, I wasn't crying as much and I could think or talk about him without spiraling into a depressive episode for hours. Lately, though, my mind has been going off the rails. I had a panic attack off and on for like 4 days straight last week. I can still feel it creeping in the background, just waiting for me to give in to it. I'm starting to lose count of how many times I've considered going to the En. I had never had a panic attack until I lost him. I've never had anxiety this bad.

I still can't sleep well. I either don't sleep at all or I sleep all day for days at a time. I don't care about eating.

    "text": "Recently I was talking to a counsellor I started having for a few sessions outside of my education setting (so through my Gt, I'm 16 and in year 12 from the Up). She suggested to me that I'm showing a lot of similarities with Bipolar Disorder and that she recommends I see my Gt again for a proper mental health assessment because I've never had one. Tw in this post for cutting ideation, X mentions, suicidlality etc. I don't think I have Bipolar disorder and she said she isn't qualified in diagnosis hence why she's wanting to refer me back to my Gt. However, I very much do have episodes of feeling which can either be extremely productive (which doesn't happen often and the most it's lasted is 4 days) and self-destructive ones where I basically feel like I'm powerful I guess so I can do risky things like wanting to jump off roofs, stabbing myself, taking a lot of pills etc because for some reason ever though in the back of my mind I know there's low chance with survival in all of that, in the moment I do it for the thrill. But on the other side I have a self destructive side that's coming from a low perspective too. Which is what I'm terrified of because I experienced an episode really bad of it yesterday. Basically feeling no self worth, and that I deserve to hurt. That the world is better without me and I get very hyper-fixated again of graphic things like cutting or shooting myself but instead I do it because I just want to d! e. To for description of cutting. Yesterday to keep it short it started off on my bus ride home, so about 3 Happy_face_smiley . 0 ish. I remember getting on the bus and starting to feel but couldn't place why. I then started to feel num and I couldn't focus on the world around me. I distinctively also remember when looking out the window, things were going too quick for me and even though I was on a bus going at a stable speed, It felt like it was all speeding up and I was far behind. I could see the signs outside but when trying to read them I had to really focus because it was blurry in my head. Not blurry vision, but blurry in my head. Then I remember starting to feel low and losing energy and motivation to keep my head up. Its the kinda tired of the world I feel when I'm depressed. No want to be there, no energy mentally to hold my head up or even present to be okay anymore. I just leaned against the bus window whilst the world outside was just quiet around me. I mean walking through the bus bus station was weird because I didn't even make note of the people. I just lodged and walked past them all in a date seeing them there to avoid, but not registering them there if that makes sense. Anyway, This continued until I got home. Then when I got home I got extremely self destructive and was romantising cutting and graphically describing how I wanted to cut (To) all down my legs so when I bent my knees the cuts would game, vertically down my arms, up and round the face (but I for some reason wanted to avoid the eyes), extending my smile (think its called the joker or something in the sh community) and I said something along the lines of thin line down my stomach and then force down and with more graphic description I'm going to leave out talking about my parts. How I wanted to remove them and them off with a knife. This then morphed into me saying how men just want me alive to use me for sx and that my existence only amounted to being little traumatized sx This then continued where I started talking about allowing myself to be used so much to where its triggering to the point of where no reason not Commit s. You all know what I'm talking about. Saying how that way I'd push people away enough and that they'll never want me anymore so then I wouldn't have to feel bad or allow others to suffer. Because they wouldn't care and I'd be even more of a low life to them than I already am. Then depression hits. Don't need to describe that too much other than I don't feel real and have the usual low self worth, esteem, view on the world etc. Can get extremely suicidal too. Losing motivation, not able to pay attention in sixth form because of it etc. Then where I hypersexualise myself with men. Feeling like I deserve to be used as a vessel for their pleasure. But I don't want to be and I use it as a way to self destruct. Normally Afterwards I get extremely triggered at what I've done and have a breakdown because I'm actually gay. I'm lesbian. I have a fear of men and sexual things to the point of panic attacks. Especially with men. So. I'm scared of mentioning all this in the detail that it is because of being sectionid or something. I didn't even sh yesterday, despite having the worst ideation about it I've ever had. I was imaging it as I was typing and in a sense it felt real. I couldn't feel it type real but I could see it. This episode cycle of what I describe Tongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry . the not feeling real, then having no energy to self destructive with sh thoughts and then about hacking off parts of my body because of men etc. It really scared me. And it lasted about 3 hours, so I don't think I'm bipolar with that in mind. I don't know. It's all a mess. Sorry for any typos, I'm really tired. Can anyone give any insight? ",

    "text": "So to inform everybody about what I do, Im a mental health technician for Wellstone behavioral health. Ive been working there since September 2021, when I turned 19. After all my experiences there, Ive discovered a lot of cons about the mental health system. The one big thing Ive discovered about this shitty facility is that the staff is nothing more but a bunch of room temperature In fuck. That dont know shit about procedure and policy. On March 13th, the leading R on the unit approved a technician to give an individual, suffering from schizoaffective disorder and on Q15 (suicide prevention) a fucking razor. I didn't know about this because I wasn't working that day. This R has been working here for over 8 years and doesn't know the ins outs of the facility. Not forget to mention, this same guy was caught having sex with another resident in the showers. This Resident took the razor, fortunately, only shaved all of his hair off of his head and did not kill someone or himself. The next day when I came in, I was informed of what happened and sent the R a message (the ss will be posted below), and she replied with such foul language, just to be proven wrong. In the next course of days, the administration decided to inform all the nurses about the policy because I complained to them about the misinformation and contradicting amongst the nurses because they have no fucking clue about the policy. So they informed the nurses and so on. The next week they came out with a new Handbook, explaining, explicitly to not give the residents any kind of electric razor, clippers, etc. And I highlighted a portion and sent it to my friend, Melanie who was working that day when the incident arose. She then told me that it was inefficient and I had to prove her wrong, which you will see the ss below. I just wanted to show this to show the incoherence and incompetence of staff in a mental health facility to educate people on the importance of policy and procedures. Its important to follow these policies because anything can happen so fast, and the punishment will be upon the person responsible for looking over the residents. ",

I spent a lot of day cutting mold off bread to eat with ketchup or canned vegetables (my mom would sell her food stamps for drug and we never really had food), taking cold showers cause we didnt have hot water, verbal and mental abuse, raised in a crack house. From 3 months to 12 years old my dad was locked up, once he got out and moved in, things got worse. I was raped by one of his friends a couple months after I had turned 12, the lights would get shut off every other month, I turned to stealing food from a local Walgreens to get by, my dad dealt dope to my mom and sister, full blown crack house. By 13 the house had been raided numerous times, the final one was when I came home from school to everyone and hand cuffs and I was alone with some officers. Shortly after I ended up in a foster program. After a while my grandparents got custody, finally peace, a warm bed with no bugs, being able to take hot showers, finally feeling loved after years of abuse and neglect, but it didnt last long. Only a couple years of living with them my grandma fell ill with liver cancer when I was 16 and passed a month after I turned 17.

I broke off a seven year relationship about six months ago and moved in with a flatmate I'd found off the internet. I get a long well with this guy, but something happened yesterday that I just find amazing. I struggle big time with keeping things tidy and organised. My former partner used to do all the washing, cleaning and tidying whilst I worked full-time. Prior to being in my former relationship I lived at home and everything was kind of done for me. I had planned to clean up my bedroom in the apartment I live in for several weekends now and never had the energy or discipline to do it. I was talking about my illness to my flatmate and mentioned that for me, tidying and cleaning were exceptionally difficult tasks and I apologised for not being as tidy as he was. I returned home from work yesterday and opened my bedroom door - I couldn't believe it, everything had been picked up, cleaned and placed in either my wardrobe or on my bed in a pile. I broke down crying, my flatmate had done literally so much - my floor had been vacuumed with stains removed, my clothes were in the washing machine - hell, even my bed had been made. I couldn't tell my flatmate how much this all meant to me! He just sailed and said that he got some personal satisfaction out of helping and tidying up. I gave him a hug and basically just cried for the rest of the afternoon. Mental illness is hell. I hate my schizophrenia. All I can say is that I am eternally grateful for those people in life who just help - no expectation of return - just help. ",

I'd be sure things were moving around me, I'd be SUR something was wrong, COMPLETELY DEADLY SUR. Not because of any external factor, the feeling/emotion/certainty of SOMETHING BEING VERY WRONG was extremely strong and everincreasing. I'd get tormented with mental flashes and images of some of the most grotesque shit. If I think and remember of them now they seem like stereotypical terror, uninteresting stuff. When I had these events however they were completely horrible and fueled my dread. I had to leave my room and go somewhere else or talk to someone to try to calm down and get those things out of my head. This was a very long time ago when I was younger than 10. Over the years after starting puberty, once or twice a year I'll have this happen to me again. Now without any specific location. If I am sleepy or haven't slept for long, it's possible that it happens. I'll started suddenly feeling extreme violent fear and dread. go almost paralysed (figuratively). Unfocus on my surroundings and focus on the feeling that is consuming me. And flashes of the most horrible shit will be flashing in my mind or playing like a movie. I open my eyes they are still in my mind. I close my eyes they are even worse an more lived. I can't think of anything else. I have to deliberaly break the spell off and turn some music on and focus extremely and intently on a video or song to hope thi state vanishes. Shower help a little but historically not enough.

    "text": "I need to bring something to the attention of all who come along because it has become a very big issue in a lot of posts. Tone policing. Tone policing is a tactic in arguments that abusers use to shift the conversation away from what the abused person is putting forth and onto how they put it. A common one that happens not only in this sub but all over the internet is, just for example, mentally ill does not give you the right to be . A good response to this is, funk you, I will tell you what I need to tell you the way I need to tell you it. One person in a position of say once in my life tried to correct me on how I was referring to my own genitals when I was complaining about how another member of the household was grabbing them and twisting just for goggles (aka sexual assault) before I punched her in the head hard enough to put her on the ground. She did learn a valuable lesson that day, however. If you keep grabbing your twelve year old brother by his hairy cock and hurting him that way enough times, he will hit you like you have never been hit before. But no, the shitbreath of the house never learned. Told me to use the right term. Would not even respond when I angrily tried to bring it to his attention that my punch was for the sole purpose of making repeated assaults stop. But then again, with the way shitbreath and compliance were assaulting me on a regular basis, maybe they just did not want to address that subject. This is what I am talking about when I say that I want to kill the bullies that I used to share a house with, and that tone policing is wrong. Oh no, Baphomet In Steel, you are not validly complaining that your little sister is assaulting you in a way that should get an adult thrown in prison. You are using the wrong word. So if you find yourself wanting to type mentally ill does not give you the right to be when someone is writing angrily about being treated in a manner that they feel is wrong, even if they are incorrect, do not do it. It does not make you look like an authority. It makes you look like an absolute piece of shit that I would rattle off the sins of as a eulogy. I once lived with two people I would do that to. This In what happened, maayte, so get over yourself and eat shit before linking your shoes clean. , as well as illustrating the difference between it and setting boundaries, and when tone policing becomes toxic. I emphasised that one in particular because X does not give you the right to be is one of the most highly toxic forms of tone policing. So on the behalf of all the people in this sub who struggle daily with the effects of abuse, such as the massive problems with anxiety or the seeing of your faces on every person who passes you, and wanting to punch them in my particular case, do not tell people that what they struggle with does not give them the right to be rude. I have never been told that what I live with every day does not give me a right to be rude face to face. Because people only need to look at me and listen to me speak for a little while to know how bad an idea it is. The alternative to me being rude is not one people generally like. Sometimes, when I am watching the Black Mirror episode Dated In The Nation, I know that a Game Of Consequences that exclusively targets people who tone police would be a great thing for Humanity. ",

    "text": "I am a 20 years old atm, and I think that my mind and thoughts are the most important part to work on in my life. Why? . Because having a strong and stable mind that has leadership over everything in my body can help me reduce stress, focus on what's important, and always make a right choice of how to use my body. Some examples would be getting rid of thoughts that drag me down, like embarrassment of sometime where I messed up, feeling bad about something that happened at work. Some examples would be making the right choices, whether it's picking what I want to do in my life, or even choosing to eat this chocolate bar or not, if I had complete 100% success rate of following what my mind thinks is correct, I believe that I would have a better life. Why could human beings rule the planet and not lions or tigers? Because human beings have great minds that work much better, the less human beings use their minds, the more they would become like animals, I don't mean it in a bad way, maybe it's fun for some people to live a life where you ignore your mind and follow your body (desires) just like animals, but it just makes us miserable in my opinion, the mind is what needs to be focused on and the rest of the body will follow, a healthy mind will bring a healthy body. So if we use our minds we can become better, I think it's all indications that our minds are great and we need to give them lots of attention with training. So the rest of our bodies can follow up our minds, because minds know better than anything else. I've been thinking of how can we really our . In my opinion there's 2 major areas that we need to focus on in our minds:. 1) Getting rid of unnecessary information and thoughts. (Deleting). This would be helpful in reducing our stress, imagine you could delete that memory of when you seed yourself and embarrassed yourself in class, imagine you could delete your memory of having the worst work day you had in your life once you get home and enjoy your time, imagine you could delete all of the thoughts you have before going into an important job interview and just live the moment. I like to think of it as closing those background applications on your cellphone. I think this skill could be trained the moment you realize that these thoughts don't improve your life, I could cry in my room because I embarrassed myself in class today, but I could use those two hours to chill around and have fun. I think it's about learning to shut down these unimportant thoughts everytime they come to you, and learning to have fun despite them. 2) Training the rest of your body to follow your mind orders. (Controlling). Why do I sometimes eat that chocolate bar even though I knew that I need to lose 10 kgs to be healthy? What's so hard about controlling myself? . What's so hard in being very disciplined about anything? whether it's studying, working out, eating clean. In my opinion, it comes down to that little split second of thought you do in your mind without feeling about it and taking decisions, you take that chocolate bar and eat it because your mind lost the battle to your body desires, your body wants that dummy bar, even though it's bad for you and your mind knows it, your mind didn't stand a chance, that's because your mind isn't trained enough for these battles. I think that starting slowly is key, mind training is harder than working out your body, mind training is super tiring, you can't rush it or your mind will lose the battles. The most important thing is focusing on the those days that you feel you don't want to do that homework, you don't want to go to the gym, you don't want to diet, you don't want to clean your room, you don't want to brush your teeth . In those days, it's exactly when you train your mind, whenever you win a battle against your body desires/laziness, your mind will get stronger, and will start winning bigger and bigger battles the stronger it gets. The key in my opinion is starting with something small that you think you can force yourself (aka your mind can win your body desires) in your bad days to do them, like reading for 15 mins, it's not alot, but can you do it for a whole year consistently without missing NE day? that's where the real challenge is.

    "text": "I'm a 33 yr old male and I've recently been struggling with what (I think) is my partner finally leaving me. It's been very hard to cope with and I'd be lying if suicide doesn't creep into my head. I've always been afraid to I guess medically admit I have suicidal thoughts because I thought if I ever checked myself in to a mental health facility it would turn me into a prohibited processor or ruin any opportunity of passing a federal background check on future firearms purchases? I also have a CL and was wondering if that could be threatened as well? Th shooting myself seems terrifying there's so many things that make in unappealing to me to do. A big one is that after I'd be dead and at least the gun I killed myself with would probably most certainly be confiscated by law enforcement and used as evidence and would never go to a friend or loved one. Also I don't want to stack the suicide by firearms body count so it can unfairly used as a statistic that negatively effects current or future gun owners. Guns mean a lot to me. Shooting and hunting are a big hobby of mine and owning/carrying a firearm brings a lot of peace of mind to my safety in a world that seems to get ever more violent, divided, and crazy. I wish it wasn't that way and pray till the day I die I'll NEVER have to use a gun on anybody. Point is, firearms are big part of who I am and what I like, and while I am currently in a very very shitty place atm I would like to get out and enjoy those things again unhampered. I don't want a desperate dark time in my life to ruin something that really brings me joy. Please I'm looking for sound advice and not for this to turn into some gun debate. If it does I'll remove this post I'm only looking for sound advice. not a political opinion argument. Thank you. And stay safe everyone. ",

    "text": "Hi Everyone, . This is my first time posting on this sub. I'm honestly at a loss for what to do in this situation. My (26f) younger sister (17f) has been struggling with depersonalization for a while now. It's been getting really bad recently. The last few weeks she hasn't been going to school because she says being in crowds makes her depersonalization worse. Instead, she stays home and games all day. We let it slide at first, because classes had an online option due to covid, and because my sister isn't the type to cry wolf or bring attention to herself. She has always been a super sweet and quiet kid. But now that online classes aren't an option anymore, we have been pushing her to attend her classes even though she says its bad for her mental health. We do this because the alternative would be her essentially temporarily dropping out of school. Or I guess we could go through the process of getting her diagnosed and get special treatment from the school where she can do school from home, but who knows how long that process would take and if her staying home would make her feel better or worse in the long run. We booked an in-person appointment with a psychotherapist (in the past we tried using the free online counselors for youth, but she didn't like the online option and there was no in-person option, so she stopped after 1 session). She went for the first time last week, which she said was nice because she opened up. However, my younger sister just told my other sister that she tried killing herself using pills yesterday. At this point, I don't know what to do. I've always been an ear to listen to my sisters problems, I've offered whatever support I can. I found a counselling and am committed to taking her and paying for her sessions on a regular basis (my parents are lower-income so it would be hard on them). What should I do? Should I continue making her go to school and restricting her computer time (I said that she can only go on the computer in the late afternoon/evening until 11 p. m. if she goes to school that day, otherwise no computer)? Should I find a psychologist instead of psychiatrist? What should I say to her? She isn't her usual sweet self, I can see she is hurting so much each day. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

    "text": "Hello thank you for reading my post and any advice would be appreciated. So Im a 19-year-old guy from Southern California, I dated my ex for about 8 months and it was a relationship plagued with many issues. She cheated on me at the beginning of the relationship and I later found out stayed with her and then cheated on her. It was this weird situation because we both pronged each other so we saw it as were equal lets try to make this work. Though our relationship could be considered rocky at best I still loved her very much and I had never felt such strong emotions for someone like that before. She was my first real girlfriend, she introduced me to her family and vice versa, we went on vacations with each other, we went to punk shows and enjoyed music because we had a similar taste in music. Around December she caught me flirting with girls on my phone and I guess you can say she ended the relationship but everything was still the same, we would see each other regularly, have sex pretty regularly, go out and do things with one other, and talk all the time like we did. It was almost as like we never even broke but she said the relationship was over but if I prove to her that I would make a change that we would get back together. At first, I was super apologetics and begged her for forgiveness but I soon realized that everything was still the same minus the fact that we technically arent in a relationship anymore. I did a lot of souls searching and talking to those around me who told me it was for the best that we didnt date anymore so I started talking to other girls. Around this time I meet my guitar teacher and started playing the guitar(Ive been playing for about 3 months now) its something that makes me very happy and I enjoy doing it. Like I mentioned earlier with my ex everything felt the same except we technically weren in a relationship but she would still say she loves and cares about me. In December I was still trying to get her forgiveness, she bought me these sick computer speakers. I bought her this ring with our names engraved on it but she didnt really seem to like it and even left it at my house and never took it. Even though thats what she was begging me to buy for her. At one point I told her that it bothered me that she completely just tossed away the ring and her response is why would I wear a promise ring when Ive broken the promise I didnt have a rebuttal to it so I dropped the subject. January rolled around and the idea of trying to gain her favor back and earning our relationship back grew to disdain. We both were on bubble/tender, talking to other people flirting, but we still would be in this weird situation where we were in this relationship saying I love you to each other. So like I mentioned earlier I had downloaded dating apps and met/flirted with some girls. And she was doing the same thing but I told her that Im growing tired of this weird thing and that I want to be back with her and try to make things work and she was kinda blowing it off. I deleted all the dating apps I wasnt meeting flirting with any girls and I didnt do anything with anyone besides her this whole time. So fast forward to my birthday on February 1st and she bought tickets for us to go to knots berry farm(amusement park here in SoCal) we had a good time and we ended up having sex later that night. During this whole weird period, we were having sex pretty consistently. My birthday ended up being the last time we saw each for a while because. My best friends said that they saw her on bubble/tender. I made new accounts and I saw her. She wiped right on me both times. And it set me off because I kept telling her I wanted to be with her and wanted to start over and she said wanted to as well but wanted to make sure but wanted wait and that she loved me and only wanted to be with me would always say she cant imagine being with anyone but me. So seeing her on these apps, even though we told each other we weren going to be on them anymore. So I sent her this long message telling her how I felt about her, our relationship, and the whole tender/bubble situation and that I was through with her. Then it was almost as she flipped the script and that she was the one begging me to get back with each other and she pulled her whole I love you I cant imagine being with one else but you blah blah. But I was done and was ready to emotionally move which I feel like for the most part I have. So I completely stopped talking to her, many of my close friends helped me out a lot, especially my best friend. I felt sorta free in a way and I was trying my best to move on. I met other girls and had hookups with a lot of them. I mean last week I had sex with two different girls in one night on Friday. But every time I feel like happy at first after but then shortly after I go back to this feeling of emptiness that I have been feeling. I and my family had a trip planned out to give a visit to our family in El Salvador and we went it was only for a week but it was the happiest I had been in so long as soon as I came back that feeling of emptiness came back full force. a couple of weeks after I came back me and my friends decided we wanted to try shrooms, it was a whole ordeal to get them but we somehow got them. We had it all planned out but it kinda fell through me and my best friend ended up taking the. I, unfortunately, had a bad trip at first the trip went super well but I took about 7 grams and it was my first time and I started telling my friend I was depressed, then it turned into I'm planning on committing suicide when I'm older. But something came upon me and I was telling him I wanted to kill myself right then and there, and I tried to kill myself but my friend stopped me. I have been pretty traumatized since that night and I have been thinking about it so much. During the time I was in El Salvador, my ex made a tik tok about me saying I was a terrible person and that I treated her horrible and that she was the victim of the relationship and it got like 12,000 views. She also posted a video on her Instagram story of some random linking her face and her kissing him after. So I wanted nothing to do with her anymore but after my bad trip, I felt emotionally vulnerable. And I tested her back and I told her what I went through and we started texting again. She told me that she wanted to see me again and I wasn't there emotionally, she came over and we ended up having sex and we've done this twice now. I just feel like I have gone through so much these last 3 months and it has been so much to handle. After I took the shrooms I felt like I needed to better my actions and I planning on going back to school I have stopped smoking weed and drinking(I never did it often but I want to completely stop). I'm growing tired of this constant feeling of emptiness I feel every day of my life, and I feel like I haven't been trying to move my life forward and I keep going back to the same place I keep telling myself I want to move from. I don't know if it's depression or what but I'm tired of the way I feel. Sometimes when I think about my bad trip I just chalk it up to me being high but other times I feel like that deep down I actually want to and that the shrooms just made me realize. I love and appreciate my best friend, my other friends, and my family because they provide me with amazing support but these feelings still linger and I'm growing tired of it. The thing that has been providing me with happiness is playing guitar and it's been my escape. I would appreciate someone to talk to, maybe I need someone fresh perspective. ",

It's as if I sit and question myself for their actions that caused me to get rid of them and then I feel as I make up theoretical situations in my head where they would apologise or make an effort to reach out just so I can get that good feeling back of telling them to off again to make sure they got the point. I literally dont seem to be able to do anything to distract myself from it, I started reading, listening to alot of music, going for walks etc but I get very short windows to focus on what i'm doing before it leads straight back to the negative things.

I still try, but if I try to help while I'm clearly stressed out too, I feel like it ends up doing more harm than good.

I constantly think about blowing my brains out on the daily. the only thing keeping me from doing it is that I have no idea what happens after death. I constantly punch myself or get overly angry at myself for the most minute things that don't really matter. i think its because of unresolved trauma like the physical and mental abuse ive had to deal with throughout my life among other things to deep to really go into detail. I want to get help, but me and my parents don't have insurance right now to get me in therapy and/or on some mens. what do I do? I can't take this anymore I just want to feel normal. I feel alone even though I have lots of people around me. ",

    "text": "Im making this post so I dont send this message to him and regret it immediately. Sorry, I dont have anyone else to talk to or anything. ________. Hey man. Im writing this message in my notes because Im kinda hoping that by the time I finish writing it, Ill have got it out of my system, because sending it would be an absolutely terrible idea and only burden you for no reason. I keep nearly deleting it because whats even the point in writing this? But Im going to try anyway. The way I was to everyone and especially to (name) towards the end of uni was fucking horrible, Im well aware of that fact and have been since the moment I did it. I am mentally unwell and Ive been trying to get help for 4 years but I dont have the money to go private, everything takes forever. I feel no closer to getting help now than I was back then. And it took me a long time to get over losing everyone, and to forgive myself for basically ruining my life and sabotaging all friendships, friendships which I thought were gonna be for life but which I sucked up. Ive not made any other friends since then - Ive been completely alone, I dont have anyone to talk to, I dont go out, since uni ended I have just been sat in my room wishing things were different. Im an absolute mess. But one thing I cant shake is you. Ive been able to get over losing everyone else, but not you. I still think about you practically every day because so much stuff reminds me of you. I even dream about you, it is absolutely insane. I am the dictionary definition of in love with you, and it was something that obviously would never work, but I thought Id be able to shove those feelings aside because I valued your friendship so much. I loved hanging out and I loved our friendship, but even that I was ruining, I couldnt keep my feelings for you locked tight. Everything I did was to try and spend more time with you, the only thing I cared about was you. And yet I still managed to hurt you and the people close to you and fuck it up completely. I never thought Id feel this alone. I always liked having space to myself. But everything just reminds me of you. I miss you telling me funny stories about shows youve done, I miss watching stuff together and cooking together, I miss you being at my house, I miss being in the car with you just driving round. Just miss you, a lot. And if I were you, I wouldnt want to ever see me again, because clearly its not healthy for you, or me, for me to be around you. But I feel like its even worse not being around you sometimes. How the hell have I not been able to move on from something that never even was and was never going to be, in like, 4 years? What the fuck is wrong with me? . I wish I could go back in time and do things better. I wish you wanted to be with me as much as I wanted to be with you. I wish my brain worked properly. I wish a lot of things. I keep saying to myself, I dont deserve to suffer like this. But nobody deserves to suffer and it still happens anyway, so id. I dont even know what Im saying I miss you, I love you, Im terrified of reconnecting because till only be bad news for you and hell, you probably have a girlfriend at this point anyway and that would break my heart. Im trying to tell myself not to send this message, and Ive told myself not to for years, Ive resisted, and I just dont have the strenh left to do that anymore. I am just broken. I wish I didnt love you so much. It is so painful. You are so beautiful, and I believe in you so much, and I want you to be happy, and safe, and free, but I also want to be around you all the time. Its just impossible. Im sorry. Your not a therapist. Your not even my friend anymore. I had to stop myself from sending you birthday messages. the 30th of October is the saddest day of the year for me now. This is insane, I sound like a crazy stalker, I just - I just miss feeling whole, and happy, when Im with you. I thought Id get over it. Its been 4 years. 5? Who even knows anymore lol. But every day it still hurts not being around you anymore, and thats my fault, I just cant control my fucking feelings and my brain doesnt work. Im sorry. I think I might send you this. Its basically abuse to send you this. I just dont know what else to do. Im sat in a dark room in pain and I have nobody to talk to, nobody to reach out to, nobody to tell me Im gonna be ok. I just think of you, every time. I hope you are doing okay, I hope you are as happy as you can be, I hope you have someone to talk to when youre feeling down and someone you can really open up to. I hope I didnt put you off doing that. I hope I didnt hurt you in a permanent way. Im sorry if I did. I love you, I miss you, I know you dont feel either of those back, and thats ok. Dont have to reply to this if you read this far. I know its wrong to send it. I just dont have the strenh to stop myself sending it. Im not gonna hurt myself or anything so please dont worry about that. I just miss you, man. I really miss you. I hope one day I can meet someone who I love being around as much as I loved being around you. Not sure if thatll ever happen. Anyway, sorry for this. Hope you found a way to rename your AirPods. You are always in my thoughts. Love, me. ",

    "text": "I don't really know where to start with this. I'm a 21 year old male. I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and TSD. It seems as if every romantic relationship I'm in leads to nothing but heartache, feelings of helplessness, and generally that I'm the bad guy in every situation. I try my best to be self aware of my own issues, so I don't show anything with any partner I've been with. Recently, I just got broken up with because quote need a therapist, not a and it kind of shattered me in more ways than one. It makes me feel as if I'm not allowed to have these problems. That because I'm a man, my issues are a burden to whomever I'm dating. My entire life, I've struggled with mental health. I started showing signs of depression when I was around 11, around the same time my dad started to go to the A for his own problems. After being physically abused from the ages of 3-12, it leaves a lasting impact on you, more than just your relationship with the abuser. It creates this thought of my own dad beats on me, how is anyone supposed to love me if he doesn't even want . After getting diagnosed at age 17 after a failed suicide attempt on March 14, 2018, I knew I needed help. I got diagnosed and I got put on medication, and it started working and helping. But then mom quit her job and I stopped getting health insurance, which means no more therapy and psychologist, which means no more medication. So for 3 years, I've been raw logging life. No medication, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. I rarely ever drink, if I do its a glass of wine. I've started to realize my mental health problems affect more than just myself, but the people around me. I've been told in every relationship I've been in since I was 19 that my mental health issues are a burden and that I shouldn't be allowed to show these problems, that I'm expected to be of clear and sound mind 100% of the time. At this point, I'm beyond broken mentally and completely exhausted. I feel like I'm never going to get better and that relationships are going to be a lost cause every time. I've lost countless friends because of my problems. I don't feel comfortable telling anyone except a female therapist and psychologist about my problems because I don't feel comfortable with men at all when it comes to mental health. A part of me doesn't even feel human. The only part of me that reminds me I'm remotely human is my arms being covered in tattoos and being reminded of the negative emotions I feel. I even wonder if life is worth living at this point because its nothing but heartache, depressive episodes, and feelings of worthlessness. If anyone wants to give their two cents, feel free. I just mostly needed a platform to get certain things off my chest that I feel as if I can't share with anyone. ",

    "text": "C: mentions of social anxiety/anxiety in general. When I enter social situationseven on the internet immediately get anxious that people won't like me. I start scanning for threats. By degrees, this eats away at the goal I set out for myself in the first placebo write. I tried joining Tumblr and promoting my writing there, but I royalty stuck my foot in it with one user, and they held (are still nursing) a grudge against me. Suddenly, it's not about writing anymore, and it's become a source of anxiety and dread. It's especially painful not to be liked, even if it's just one or two people. The paranoia starts to set in, and I become hyper-vigilant. I'm prone to more anxiety attacks. It happened when I was a kid too, when other kids would make fun of me. I know it's never a pleasant experience to be actively disliked or bullied, and to know that someone is saying things about you behind your back that are mean and untrue. It just seems like I am especially thin-skinned in these matters. My therapist says that at the core of social anxiety is giving other people control over your happiness. But she also says that it's sort of a biological thing: back in the days of hunting and gathering, if you got ousted from a group you'd have to fend for yourself and were less likely to survive. Even as a baby and in early childhood, you're completely dependent on caregivers, and if said caregivers decide they don't care for you, then it's not looking good. And then, at school age, there's a lot of social status and picking order on the playground. If you end up at the bottom of it, your daily life becomes exceedingly difficult. It becomes ingrained by the time one hits adulthood. She says that it's about me unlearning all that toxicity as an adult. To sit with the at-times disquieting sensation of knowing someone actively dislikes me and I can't change their mind. And to not let it affect my self-image. That I am who I am, and I should accept that. But I've struggled with this people-pleasing, everyone-must-like-me issue my whole life, and it has worn me down. My therapist and I are working hard at learning to see that sensitivity is actually a good thing, and to accept that not everyone will get along with me. If you have the same or a similar issue, how do you cope with it? And if you've read this far, thank you! ",

Now recently a couple of days ago, she again has started to defame me in society. She lies and says that she doesn't suffer from schizophrenia, she denies about so many events which occurred, she sends nonsense emails to me which makes no sense, she lies all the time. For example, she said in emails that you have educated your wife, even though I have no wife, I'm 21 and unmarried, she talks about her past life with me and all kinds of nonsense. She recently also called some people from mental hospital to arrest me and admit me in their mental hospital, by lying to them that I'm mentally unstable. Those people talked to me and my mother, I showed them all the proofs and they left, they told me they realised that my mother is mentally sick. She is constantly lying to people, random strangers and claiming that my son has psychological problem, he is mentally unstable, even though it's her who is mentally sick. A lot of people can believe her unless I prove them wrong by showing them all the proofs. She has been emotionally abusing me for years, how can I get her admitted to a mental hospital without her consent, without taking any legal step?

She thinks that her neighbours are out to get her, she thinks that her neighbours are plotting to kill her. She also thinks that her neighbours have killed someone else, because she said that she heard them admit it , and she recorded them admitting that they killed someone. She said that her neighbours talk shit about her , and want to harm her, and say sexual things to and about her. She lives in an apartment building and they live right underneath her, so she will sit by her window and she will record them, because she thinks that they are talking crap about her and saying that they want to kill and harm her, so she will record them trying to get as much evidence as she possible can so she can go to the police. The thing is though, that NOBODY else can hear these recordings. Only she can. She was at my house yesterday and she was playing these recordings to us, and as the video was playing she was like See , they just said this and then she would tell us what they said . But we dont hear nothing. It is completely quiet. My boy friend literally had the phone up to his ear and didnt hear anything, and she was a few feet away from him and she supposedly heard it so loud . Me , My Boyfriend , and 6 other people have listened to these recordings and no one else heard anything , but her . And she says that she hears them talking so loudly when to us it is completely quiet. And she is so positive and confident that these recordings are real because every video that she has, anytime that she listens to it she always hears the exact same thing on each video. So it is not like every single time that she listens to the video she hears something different. She has like 14 videos of her neighbours talking about her. and every video she hears the same thing, like every video says something different. But no matter how many time she listens to each video it always says that same thing that it said last time that is why she believes that it is true. But again, nobody else hears anything. The videos she shows up is completely quiet and no one is talking. Has anyone experienced this? Do you know anyone that has experience this? . It is so hard and difficult to watch her go through this, because I have been so supportive to her ever since I met her 5 years ago ( and I will continue being supportive ) but when I tell her that we dont hear anything she gets frustrated and mad, ( because she hears it ). I UNDERSTAND why she is frustrated though, because hearing voices that other people dont hear I get can be very stressful and frustrated. But I am just stuck. Its hard watching someone you love go through this. I need advice. ",

Eventually a really bad video game addiction and porn entered the mix. I felt emptiness pretty much all the time throughout middle and high school. Towards the end of high school I started sneaking alcohol out of the cabinet in my house just because I wanted something, anything different to do and always felt bored. When Covid came around, I started vaping nicotine and never looked back until a few weeks ago when I finally quit. Around the same time, I bought my first HC tape because I was bored and sad and after that first night, there wasnt one day when I didnt get high for 7 months straight. I also decided to do shrooms and MT on a whim a few months after starting smoking weed because that also got boring and I again felt an itch to do something different. I wasnt able to quit weed until I got a girlfriend and spent nearly every hour of my free time with her at the expense of all of my other friends. Turns out I even get addicted to people.

    "text": "Basically, I am 18 and female. I have had a rough past and I also used to go to a therapist, she told me it was trauma. Sexual abuse to be precise. My dumb younger self didnt want to continue going to her appointments and thats why the trauma is only and not really treated, you know? . I have this issue that my whole personality is just fucking weird. I have thoughts that nobody has. I am a maladaptive dreamer and I have had some really bad problems with that. Currently I am in the stage where I grave male validation and attention at all costs. I always need to have someone to obsess over, and when I get it I am unhinged. I am almost borderline stalking their social media, I dream about them 24/7 I want to talk to them. I think its worth to mention that I never carved male attention before that, it only started now. Talking to boys was always veryyyy uncommon for me. Today I hit a new where I died my crush, I slid into his dms by acting like something happened so he would ask me whats wrong and so I could try to have a conversation with him. I feel so weird because I cant stop thinking about him. I am soo jealous. I feel like I am unlovable and dirty. I am fat, disgusting, and ugly. To me, everyone needs a man so he can take care of them and I dont deserve a man because I am ugly. Its so twisted, on the one side I want men to obsess over me and on the other side I want them to stop giving me any attention. I dont know whats wrong with me. Actually I do know, but I dont know how to fix it. I know I should go back to therapy but the problem is: When I used to go to my therapist, I was 14. I stayed there for about 2 years and quit at 16. Now that I am 18 I cant go back to her because I am an adult and she is a childrens therapist. And on top of that I leave my city this summer to go to Uni. I cant stand being myself anymore to be honest. I am such an embarrassment to society and I always act like a failure I hate myself so so much. Me being very self-aware of my behavior and analyzing every single thing is also not helping anymore. Because now, I know whats wrong with me but I cant fix it alone. I just want to be free of this mindset, I want to be normal so badly. But I cant. I dont know how I can keep going, does anyone have any advice on how to improve until I get a therapist? ",

They've helped me make sense of a lot of things. They make me feel safe. Their voice is similar to mine but they talk in a slightly different way. I have no control over A. Sometimes it's easy to tell that A is talking to me, but sometimes it's extremely difficult. I might not be consciously choosing the words they say, but I can't tell if it's just me talking to myself or A talking to me. Whenever I try to write down something different than what they say it feels wrong. If I don't write anything, they end up doing it for me. If they want me to write (I use a journal app), it's like I'm physically unable to close it until I listen to what they have to say. I can't ignore them. Ignoring them makes everything so much worse. But I keep worrying that because I'm trying to understand them more, I'm going to end up convincing myself of things that aren't true. ",

    "text": "Hi kind people of reddit. This is my alt account and I recently turned 16 years old. I've been going in therapy for about a year now and since then I've made remarkable progress according to my therapist. When I started doing sessions with her (my therapist) I was a shut in person that didn't talk to anyone. At school I didn't have any friends I didn't have any fun and life had no meaning for me. My constant thoughts were that if something would have happened to me and I died I wouldn't mind so much. Of course my parents would more me but that's the extent of the people who would miss me. I never had suicidal tendencies or thoughts but I decided to start doing bunny jumping in order to feel the rush of death or at least come close to it but that didn't happen because I didn't die but I felt the rush. Back to my tharpist. As I said earlier I have made remarkable progress. Nowadays I value my life very handsomely and I wouldn't want to leave this world just yet. I even started making friends. For all of primary/high school years I've been alone with zero to none social skills but that changed. I made friends that I treasure dearly and I even met the love of my life. We started a relationship and we started dating and we've been together for about three and a half months, months that I will hold close to my heart forever and ever and I want to make them a life time and they want the same thing as well. We want to be together forever and ever. But things became difficult. I really don't want to discuss the bad stuff but life has thrown me some pretty awful things that have to do with the person that I love. We love each other but she is in a very difficult mental state and suffers from a mental disorder but that doesn't have to do with the bad things that have been going on in my life. Because of my partners fragile mental state I've been starting to revert to my old self and that has put made me realize that I have started to become mentally unstable as well. I try to bury my feelings because I feel that my feelings won't fit with the over filling bad emotions that my partner feels that have to do with hurting themselves in various ways or even suicide. I chose to bury my feelings so I can focus on my partner and make them feel better but that's not healthy. I've been going to therapy because I was unable to express emotion. I never cried I was never actually happy but now after all of the progress I made and all of the emotions I freed from my subconscious I force myself to evolve in to the lesser person I was so I can make my partner happy because I value them even above myself. Why would a teenager like me be exposed and worry about things like how much my alcohol my partner would drink, if they'll do drugs, if they'll take their medication, or if they'll hurt themselves again or even if they actually killed themselves. These things can make me not sleep at nights and even if I do I'll either have sleep paralysis demons or basic nightmares and thus not sleep and lower my school performance. Things have gotten so hard nowadays that my subconscious has started to make me forget basic emotions again and render me unable to feel or act again just like I was before. I over clock my brain so it can remember and so I can only focus it on them which I know it's again not healthy but it's what I do and that results in severe memory loss and depression. I sometimes wake up feeling so disoriented that I don't know who I am where I am and feeling that I want to die. My mental health is no where to be found that's why I'm here. To vent and to ask for advice because I'm supposed to say all those things to my parents before my therapists does as she suggested and then she will calm them down but I don't know if I have the courage or will to talk to them. My pride and my ego are too big to express emotions of defeat but I'll try but most of all I don't want to worry them. To anyone that makes it this far on my Ted talk thank you it really means a lot. I'll now be going to try to sleep so I'll be able to see to reply to anyone in the morning so see you people tomorrow. ",

I used to have a lot of friends and I used to be able to meet new people and strike up a conversation with no issue and hang out with people regularly without being anxious all the time. I wanna be how I used to be but I cant seem to overcome this feeling of impending doom whenever I have plans made and then I usually cancel last minute because I get overly anxious and then just sit in my room for the rest of the night. if we wanna get into detail of how I was treated by my ex in short I wasnt allowed to have social media, I wasnt allowed to hang out with my friends regardless if they were a boy or a girl, he had issues with him not being a top priority and me putting school, work, the gym, and even my family over him. he would get so mad when I would hang out with my sisters (20f and 17f) who are my blood related family. he would also call me a laundry list of insulting names, and also blamed my S on me. he also threatened me with my passwords, bank information, and private photos. and probably the last job before I actually did pursue legal action was him leaving a note on my car (which means he would have to drive 30 minutes to my house and walk all the way up my driveway and put it on my car), and I felt unsafe in my house. after I and dirt all of that I felt as I lost my spark that I used to have and I became weird and antisocial and an outcast. The only times I willingly leave the house are to go to my classes, work, and the gym. I have trouble making friends and talking to people and meeting people and I just want some advice on how I can put myself out there and make some friends Happy_face_or_smiley . anything helps, thank you.

I dont see my therapist for another month, and my parents are putting pressure.

I did voice My concerns but due to many factors, my situation is special and this is one of the only one my doctor can prescribe to get me settled while we go through the process of sorting the damage out that has been caused by sertraline.

Yes some are saying that they've been able to lose it, but I don't want to be put in that position where I have to lose it. How can I prevent myself from putting on weight while on it? I can't really exercise due to physical health issues, I just make sure I walk like 12-15000 steps a day and I don't really eat unhealthy. I don't even want to start the medication as the weight gain is causing me so much anxiety. Has anyone lost weight as a side effect while on it? Are there people who haven't had their weight effected? As all I see are these negative things and its fueling My reason not to accept help which isn't great. Also is it just increased appetite (something that with enough monitoring is in your control) or is it true it slows down your metabolism like some people say? So then it's out of my control .

    "text": "I deal with a lot of anxiety and depression and I seem to get depressed because I'm not doing anything with my life, but then anxious because I have such a deep pit to pull myself out of. I am an ambitious person as well as a lazy depressed person. I work 10 days in a row and 4 days off. I did nothing but watch tv and sleep for four days. I want to exercise, get outdoors with hiking and biking, read lots of books, develop social life and date, learn to play piano, keep my space cleaner and become a good cook. I've thought about writing a blog and getting more involved in advocacy in my area (I am a social worker). My whole life has been a battle between ambition and depression. I get my shit together for a few weeks, and then I fall down again. It's a never ending cycle. I'm terrified of looking back at my life 40 years from now and realizing I let time pass me by and did not live intentionally. I don't have an ounce of discipline in my bones. I don't know why. My twin brother is literally the opposite of me. He's so motivated and disciplined. I don't know how to change my life. Sometimes I wish I could throw myself into some sort of boot camp or have someone pushing me like I have no choice. I feel like I have little control over myself or what I do. I wish I had more discipline. I keep telling myself that things will get better. I will somehow change, right? But I I do not want to be like this. ",

Anytime I talk to people I now struggle to look them in the eye, I overthink everything I say and I struggle to make jokes/have a laugh like I normally would. Usually I would have been completely carefree/confident in myself but now anytime I leave a conversation I feel like shit. I feel like Ive become really serious or something, its weird. At the end of the day life could be worse, I can only imagine living in Ukraine atm but its still quite annoying. Has anyone ever had anything like this happen before? People always consider me quite a confident person but anytime I talk to my friends now I can sense that they think Im different. It could be related to stress, as in 3 months time I am shooting my own feature film and Ive been essentially working on this for the past 2 years + I havent been working any other jobs. There is a lot of work that goes into the production and its all I think about recently, Im almost obsessed with it, so that could be the issue. Anyone any advice/similar stories?

Would I take an approach where I'm really empathetic to the person and concede to make them feel better, what would that get me? Would that make me a pussy tolerating feelings over sensibility? Would it make me a likeable person to be around? What if I laid down the law approach, it doesn't matter what you want we aren't buying a dog case closed approach. Would that make me an asshole, would it make me a respectable leader because I'm making the sensible decision even if they're upset over it? . How should I have reacted when that person tried to clown me? Should I have put my foot down and said hey fucking stop it? Does that show I'm strong because I stood up to them and told them to knock it the fuck off, that I'll do something about it if I'm stepped on? Does that show I'm weak because I let someone get to my emotions, that I took them serious? Am I getting tilted over some ballbusting or am I genuinely being disrespected and I have to do something about it? What is disrespect anyway, in gangster communities murdering someone might get you respect, but not in regular society, so who gets to really say what is and isn't respectful. So what is the reality, I guess it gets by the alpha and everyone adapts to that persons world view. But then what makes you the and how can you get others to adopt your worldview. If I see it as disrespect and they see it as unserious ballbusting how can I convince them to adopt my views. Just endless fucking rabbit holes, important questions with no real answers. And I'm fucking mentally drained, I have no energy anymore. I feel weak, answerless, hopeless, I feel like I don't know fuck about shit. I feel unconfident in myself, like I have no real idea what I'm doing.

I was never depressed fortunately, but every once in a while and in literally any setting -at work, on vacation by the beach, literally anywhere- something just possess me for 3-6 seconds and makes me feel like I'm going to be stuck in this moment forever/on repeat and in a loop (or that my life in general is repetitive, even if I'm in a new setting) and because of that, life is extremely boring which causes an intense feeling of sadness and depression that literally makes me feel suicidal. However, once those few seconds are over the feeling literally just disappears, as does the intrusive thought, and I'm back to normal. It's terrifying. I don't know when it's going to happen next. It happens at least once a week and it's scaring me. No one knows or can help me and I can't live with this feeling anymore. Frown_sad_andry_or_pouting . Does anyone have any clue?

Background info, my dad wasn't always around. Not until I was a young teenager, and we weren't close for a little bit after that. I remember how excited I was to tell him I wanted to go to an agricultural highschool. He told me that I didn't want to, that I should go to a technical vocational highschool and learn a trade. I did what he said because I didn't want to lose him. I left that highschool after a year because I was miserable. I lived with my mom most of my life, and she couldn't care to take me to play baseball, or remember to pick me up on time from school. I have had no confidence to make my own decisions, I wasn't raised with much love, I was always a burden along with my brother and sister. My parents are better now, but I'm realizing how they raised me has messed me up so much, I'm so resentful towards them. I've made so many decisions growing up and even up to today just to make them happy. Now, I'm not very happy. I'm mad, sad, and anxious. Tomorrow I start with a new construction company, I don't know that I'll last. I want to break free and do my own thing, but I'm still unsure how. I do think in the end I'll find a way, because I have the audacity to live my own life. ",

    "text": "Recently Ive been having some visual hallucinations. For a while I would just see things out of the corner of my eye that weren really there (shadows, bugs etc. ) but this wasnt that disturbing because when I would look, there would be nothing and I realized it was just my brain playing tricks on me. Recently though, Ive been seeing things moving that arent moving. Sometimes its a screen sort of ballooning and getting bigger and shrinking down again. I was sitting with friends in a classroom where there was a survalence camera. I noticed it planning around the room and commented Is that camera always moving? Ive never noticed it do that. As soon as I said that and looked back up at it, it was fixed on me and completely still. My friends insisted it never moved. The scariest thing that happened was about a week ago in my chemistry lab. I was using a metal spatula to scoop out some white powder OH out of a weaker on to a scale. However everytime I got some powder on my spatula and raised it slightly, the powder would violently fly off the spatula towards the sides of the weaker. I was dumbfounded, and I kept trying only to have the same thing happen over and over. I asked the person next to me Why is the powder moving like that? and they had no idea what I was talking about. I then asked my lab partner, and the look she gave me broke my heart. She looked at me like I had lost my mind, and told me to just forget about it and move on. This was not a fluke, and I was hoping for there to be a scientific explanation but I think I was imagining the whole thing. Any advice? I dont hear voices or anything, its purely visual hallucinations. As a chemical engineering major, I take school really seriously and the idea of hallucinating in a lab is very scary. ",

I wasn't allowed to leave the room and she wouldn't let me speak or explain anything without telling me that I said things I This morning she told me I would have so many chores when I got home that I wouldn't be able to do anything else. Last night she told me her feelings mattered more than mine because she was a single mom and had so many things stressing her out. She said it to my face and I think I was in shock that she would say that to me. She even told me that whatever I was feeling wasn't a fraction of what she was feeling. After the argument, keep in mind I love to garden because it helps me calm down. I keep foxglove, a toxic plant. I think I stood in that window for about 10 minutes calculating how much it would take to hurt but not to kill. I ended up just linking one of the leaves and going to sleep. I haven't told anyone. When I woke up this morning my stomach hurt pretty bad, I dont know if its because I was hungry or from the plant but I'm scared. I made a 22 on a test today, for a class I'm failing. I'm in the last class of the day right now and I'm so scared. When I go home she's going to be so mad and I don't want to throw my life away out of self hatred. I'm so scared. I can't go home, she's going to be so mad and I'm just so tired. I can't do this. She's amazing, she's the best mom ever and she works so hard for us and I know she's stressed so I should sympathize. She told me she wanted my doctor to email her exactly how bad my eyes are because without my glasses, I cant recognize someone from 4 feet away. She wants them to tell her because she doesn't believe me when I tell her I'm hurt. It's been hard to breathe since I was young and I can't take a deep enough breath, like its never enough air. I cant even inhalt when I dawn and I can tell her this and she won't believe me. She won't believe me when I tell her about my hobbies and I understand why. I'm a liar, and I lied in the past almost without thinking. I've been trying to do better and not lie but she refuses to believe me and I understand. I really do, she has no reason to believe me but I can't keep doing this. I'm so scared, I can't go home she's going to be so mad and I can't argue with her. She won't let me. If I try to explain she cuts me off and gets so mad if I try to ask her to let me speak because then I'm interrupting her. I'm sorry, I just couldn't tell anyone I know in real life. ",

I lost several thousands of dollars in a bet that I feel I was cheated on. I committed a non violent and victimless crime that resulted in a misdemeanor and I will have to serve several days in jail (which I havent got to serve yet so thats hanging over my head). But the worst thing so far has been that I fell in love with a girl who has completely broken my heart. We dated for a few months and it seemed like we were completely in love. I was on the up and up and got a new job and it seemed like my life was finally falling into place but her past caught up to her and she ended up cheating on me with her ex (I directly caught her which was very painful). We talked for a couple weeks afterwards but we finally cut it all off about 2 months ago. She was deeply insecure and really turned into a monster in the end purposely putting me down and making me feel like I was nothing. I understand I did some things wrong but I truly think she wasnt the one for me but I still feel so bonded to her. Things were literally perfect with her for a while and its hard to let go. I have good days and some really dark days. I have trouble sleeping and when I think about her my heart races. When we were together, we were with each other 24/7 so since the relationship was only a few months it felt like it was much longer and we moved fast so it seemed pretty deep. We did so much together all over town so Im constantly reminded of her. Every time I drive by where we used to work together or where we would go out. Or even just things she would talk about, if I encounter it, I think of her. I cry a couple times a week when the emotions come and I find myself in solitude. Im just having trouble staying positive and making it through my day to day. Im thankful I have a great job and my financial situation is good. I have a lot of friends and family who support me. I just have a lot Im dealing with and their advice is just, get over her, she sucked. I logically understand that but it doesnt make me any more emotionally stable. I have been going to a therapist which is beneficial. I would like to start dating again but I still feel that Im not completely ready (I kind of want to get jail out of the way). I just feel like Ive been in a downward spiral and its hard to see the light sometimes.

    "text": "Hi all,. Diagnosed with C-TSD, Major Depressive Disorder, GA, Panic Disorder, and Dissociation. I suffer from random, frequent panic attacks brought on by intrusive thoughts. In 2020 my girlfriend and I rescued a 6 month old Schipperke/Jack Russell mix from a kill shelter in Tennessee. We had her shipped up to our home in Massachusetts and were grown quite a bond. When we got her, I wasnt experiencing panic attacks. Only anxiety. I got Covid a few months after we got her, ended up hospitalized at 25 with minor brain damage, and now suffer from mentioned panic attacks, along with everything else mentioned. We named the dog Tennessee in honor of her original home. Tennessee was found in a boarders house, along with her brothers and sisters. She was brought to a kill shelter and we managed to get her in time. That being said, shes never been trained as a service animal. No training other than basic commands and petty outside. I noticed after the panic attacks began happening, she would come over and start linking my hands, rubbing against me, linking my face, etc. I assume she saw me in a distraught manor and was confused, so that was her response. Fast forward a couple of years later, the panic attacks has become less frequent, but are more intense when they happen. About 20 minutes ago, I began having a severe one. I went in the same room as my girlfriend to talk to her and calm down. My girlfriend runs a business from home. Her work shop is on the first floor. Tennessee was on the second floor, in her bed mapping in the sun, on the opposite side of the house. I was sitting on the floor crying and hyperventilating. Tennessee came in and did her normal routine of linking and sitting with me. Ive read that dogs can pick up on different signals that humans make when theyre having a panic attack or about to have one. Very understandable. But I didnt even pass her this time. I didnt see her at all before going to see my girlfriend. Has anyone else experienced this with their dog? Regardless, Im the luckiest fell on earth to have found such a loving creature and also a girlfriend who deals with someone who is so messed up. Thanks for reading! ",

Before my 30th birthday I got 2 incurable illnesses, it literally hurts to speak, my ears ring when I eat and my eyes get red. I'm athletic and I have to have a machine hooked up to breathe at night because of this shit. I had a painful stomach surgery that didn't even fix the problems I was hoping for. Oh and the last 6 months+ I've been dealing with on off joint pain in some fingers and some lunar nerve pain / golfers elbow. I've gone to T for it but to no avail. I'm starting to suspect rheumatoid arthritis or some shit like that. Not sure if it's worth me going down that rabbit hole if my symptoms what can you check for them to just tell me I've got yet another incurable thing. Yay. My body has taken all of my dreams from me. The things I had to live for, the passion and love for this world. And it happened overnight, one day. No action of my own caused it, I ate the same foods, did the same routines, was healthy. I think about dying a lot lately. I daydream about it. How it would be so peaceful to just make it stop. I really do want to live, but if I can't play instruments, if the pain I feel outweighs the joy then there's no point. I think everyone just by default does the got so much to live nonsense because they haven't looked at things objectively and haven't been in a situation like that. They say it's bad but they can't really say why. It just is. Because evolution selected us to do so, because a species that decides life is shit, isn't very useful. There is no significant difference between me dying now or me dying 20 years from now. And yes, I do have a therapist. But imagine for a second, that your body has become a prison keeping you from everything you loved. That you're a prisoner and you're getting tortured every day. And you walk up to the prisoner and tell him maybe he should talk about his feelings. If I didn't have these illnesses, I would be back to my healthy self. I literally can't even take a woman out to dinner because I can't eat anything there anymore. The foods I can eat are so limited and they all still hurt. How can I date when I'm like this. forever?

I struggle a lot with anxiety, depression, trust issues, unsolved trauma, burnout, stress, eating disorder, Identity and sexual orientation, dysphoria. I've had anxiety for as long as i can remember and it's really rough right now and after my gf broke up with me i've been really lonely and i haven't gone out for anything other than school and just doing that is really hard. I currently have depression as well and anxiety and depression constantly fight each other, my anxiety always tells me i have to get stuff done and my depression just leaves me on my bed or in front of my computer doing nothing at all. I feel pressed at all time by everything around me which just worsens everything, i try to take breaks from life but when i do just get behind everything and feel even worse. I've always felt like i need to be better than the rest, not out of motivation but out of anxiety and that if i don't do everything perfectly then it's not good enough. I'm in the middle of an identity/sexual crisis even if i think i'm starting to get it right but people not respecting it just drains me so much, i just go by whatever they call me and slowly dying more and more inside. This and every other thing makes me completely burnt out and i don't know how to recover from it, i take breaks but it rarely makes me feel any better. Some things that have happened is impossible to let go of, this including abuse, eating disorder, drinking problems, suicide thoughts/attempt and always feeling alone and different. I've never told any of these things for my therapists had a few but no one now) or my family either. During my eating disorder i was very strict with how little i was eating and i don't even truly know why i started but a couple weeks in i mostly just got really disgusted about any foods. This behavior is starting to come back and i mostly force myself to eat something during the days, it can also be that i feel hungry at first and the 3 bites in i just feel sick and can't eat anymore. I really don't want it to get worse but i literally can't make it better myself it's psychically impossible. The only thing i got from my suicide attempt was exposing my mom for loving my brothers more than me, i have sunken deeper than both my brothers combined multiple times in life but all i ever heard was have to fix yourself bc we can't do and while my older brother got financial support, emotional support and my mom showing true affection. My younger brothers low point he told his friends he would jump of a bridge and boom, he's suddenly home from school for 3 weeks with my mom also being at home and supporting him, he got antidepressant, anxiety supporting pills, sleeping pills and everything made for him. When i actually tried to end it all after being told that it's just in my head, that it's my fault and having a really bad self harming behavior from about 3 years earlier i got 6 stitches in my arm, scars all over my body, getting 1 therapy session and getting homeschooled for the rest of the year (like 5 weeks) and then i was cured according to everyone. I think i'm still having pts from that night, it was almost 3 years ago and i can still see the moment it happened so clear and then i don't remember that much more than telling my mom and then being in a hospital bed with the doctor asking me all these question and the only one i can remember is you do this as a suicide i couldn't think clear (i had lost a lot of blood so everything after is really unclear, it was around 7-8 hours between the moment it happened to when i was in the hospital bed) and th i don't even know how i managed to stay alive. but after all that i still got less support than my brothers, my older even said middle child (me) is basically the forgotten one in most and both my parents agreed immediately. Growing up i was distant from everyone and never really opened up, one of the things i always kept quiet about was my dad. He used to get really angry at me and he abused me multiple times, some people i told was my therapist who ended up bringing it to the police without my consent and my cousins family who didn't even believe me. Those are some things that has really stuck with me and both my therapist not doing as i told her, my cousins family and the police not really doing anything about it has made me have a really hard time both trusting people and also opening up to anyone. I still have very clear memories from every single time it happened even it the last time was like 5-6 years ago, it has become a big part of my trauma and since i still never told anyone exactly what happened. But one of the worst parts about this entire thing is my entire family and everyone around me immediately defending my dad instead of me, literally every single person i know. He even lied to my therapist saying thought all night but can't remember anything which broke me completely and i honestly don't know if he was telling the truth or not, i don't even know which one is worse. My mom and brothers got asked if they had heard anything and my mom just saying no and my younger brother who was thrown out of the room still said no. And since this has been over with no one is bringing it, no one is following up and asking how i'm doing and no one probably still believes me. From that me and my dad has had a really unstable relationship, i never talk about my mental health, we never speak on the phone, we never have deep talks or anything like it. I rarely talk to my mom about my health either and she never really asks about how i'm mentally, just physically sometimes and the only time she's talking about mental health it's always about my younger brother. I always feel that my childhood was completely ruined by everything and i often get stressed because i never had the chance to truly enjoy life, i was just desperate my entire life and i had a chance to move out at 16 to study and i immediately took it out of pure desperation. I'm now 18 and my childhood haunts me everyday still and i'm just lost at this point, my girlfriend recently broke up with me as well and i currently feel like i'm going through everything by myself. I'm sorry for the long post i just have so much bottled up from my life, thanks so much if you read it and it would really help with some advise about what i should to feel better 3. ",

Last January, I found out that my job was being eliminated due to budget cuts. This was my dream job and it was absolutely getting to lose it as I had worked hard to be paid well. The following week my wife and I find out we are having our third baby. With all that was happening, we decided to move across the country to be closer to family and to live somewhere less expensive. In the new place I had a job lined up at a car dealership and did good there until December when my wife asked me to quit because the hours were too much with a newborn, 2 year old, and 4 year old to take care of every night by herself. I agreed and quit at the end of November. Now it is almost April and I am just stuck. I still need a job, but none of the companies I apply for will even call me back. I am beyond frustrated to have worked so hard for years at my good job, become excellent at it, and have every company I apply to pass me over because I don't have a degree. It is causing tension in my marriage and I am feeling pretty beat down and not confident at all. I just want to have a job I enjoy and not go to some shitty job every single day for half of what I was making and it is depressing to not even be considered for similar jobs.

    "text": "I (20F) have a younger sister (15F) and her best friend (14F) . We live in Canada so therapy is generally free. There are centers for it. Her best friend (Lanka) has been dealing with depression for the past couple years, as well as anorexia, self harm, and more. Now for one thing, I'm not completely against friends helping friends cope with depression, I had depression and a history of self harm myself, so I know what it's like to be dealing with that and feel like your friend are the only ones able to help. However, since they were young, Lanka and her mother (Katrina) have always depended on my sister to calm down her tantrums, to be there as the . I can remember at least 4 incidents off the top of my head, there are more but I wasn't there for them so I don't remember as clearly. 1: We had Lanka over for a playdate, and the girls wanted to go upstairs to talk. The thing is, when she told them they were going to stay downstairs and try out a fun recipe, I believe it was making chocolate balloons a really fun thing, you should try doing it sometime). Lanka started throwing a big hyperventilating, etc. And when my mom still told her no, they were not going upstairs to be alone, she stopped her and was staring at my mother with a hell of a stink-eye . What I got from it was no, an adult told me no, I'm going to throw a fit unless she lets us go then when that didn't work, she sat there and sucked. 2: Lanka and her mother had tested my mom about wanting to take the girls on a playdate, but my mom was out of the house at the moment, and she didn't have her phone with her so she couldn't reply. I believe around 10-20 minutes passed, and then Lanka and Katrina showed up at our front door, while my mother was out of the house because they wanted to know the reply to their question. They didn't call, or text a second time, they literally showed up at our house to ask if my sister could come with them. And the fact that they live on the OTHER side of town, which is about a 20-30 minute drive, something just felt wrong. 3: This incident was just a couple days ago. Katrina and Lanka showed up at our door once again, with no calls, no texts to let us know beforehand, and once again while my mother was out of the house. I let my sister answer the door, and I could hear her and Lanka talking, as soon as I stepped outside beside them to get our cat inside, they stopped talking, and were completely silent. Then my mother came back, and she and Katrina talked for a bit, she went upstairs, during the time she was upstairs I heard Katrina whisper to the girls leave you two alone when we go out so you can . I immediately found my mother and asked her to not give permission for my sister to go out that day. This behaviour has been a repeating pattern for a very long time. My mother came back down the stairs and told Katrina that my sister would not be going with them, as she didn't want her to have to always be the counsellor for Lanka. Katrina then got angry at my mother, saying what friends are and they left in a huff. Now I agree, friends are good to be there for you when you need help, but when things get as serious as self harm, a suicide attempt, and more, you need to find some therapy, or talk to an adult, someone who is more qualified to deal with these types of things. And most of all you don't need to come to your every single time something happens that causes you to harm or panic attack again. Now the 4th event is when Lanka was in the hospital after a suicide attempt. The first person she called was my sister, to talk about her mental health and other things. I feel she should've talked to someone else, even her mother. I fear that my sister is also being influenced by Lanka, since the entire thing started, she has lost an extreme amount of weight and she wasn't a big person to start with, I believe she was around 150 and when it started, now she is down to around 115-120, and the other day she was talking about losing more weight. I'm scared for her. I also feel distrustful of their family because every time my sister goes out with them, they will buy her something, sometimes it's quite an expensive thing, sometimes less expensive. I feel that those gifts aren't just gifts, but also something to thank/make my sister feel like she owes them. Please everyone, I need to figure what to do with this. My mother told my sister that she would have to cut off contact with her friend Lanka, and instead that is making my sister rebel against her and throw small fits, much like the ones Lanka does. I know from experience that blatantly telling her she can't have contact with Lanka, and saying she can't be her friend, will only make her want to do that more. Please Reddit, give me any advice you can. To Laughing_big_grin_or_laugh_with_glasses . e. Younger sister's best friend is dealing with a ton of mental health, suicide and anorexia. She is depending on my sister for nearly everything, especially counselling. Their behaviour is strange, including coming to the house when they didn't get a response within 15-20 minutes after texting to ask about a playdate, while my mother was not home. I am worried for my sister as she has lost a lot of weight since this started with her friend. Need to know what to do, how to approach this with sister. ",

Any time someone upsets me I think about never talking to them again and saying hurtful things to them. I sometimes think I hate them but its usually short lived and Im not mad anymore after more than a couple hours or a day . Thinking everyone at work is talking about me when I leave a room. I stop talking and shut down and I get super anxious . I have intrusive thoughts while talking to people about kissing or touching them. I have intrusive thoughts about hurting people . I think about others reactions to these thoughts and it causes me to get anxious and think theyre talking about me . I have to cover my neck every night before bed. When I become aware of it I have to cover it with my hands. Sometimes I have to wear a scarf around my neck so its not out when I become too aware of it. My boyfriend tried to tell me it was okay and took the covers off my neck and I had a panic attack and started crying. I get bored of every hobby, dislike every major, hate every job.

I've brought up that I didn't think my symptoms really fit the bipolar symptoms but I'm always told that everyone is different and won't fit the symptoms exactly. I've been asked what I think I have and whenever I say something they say those symptoms can be explained by the bipolar diagnosis. People always tell me to get a second opinion, but I've had different doctors and therapists say I fit the symptoms. My problem with that though is that they always get my records from the people I saw before so they can already see that I was diagnosed with it so I think they get that idea in their head and force my symptoms/behaviors to fit the diagnosis. Should I just start from scratch and find a new doctor but not give them any of my old information?

    "text": ". I dont know I dont know I dont know. I really really dont know what is going on and I am very confused and afraid. For the last year and some change I have not been able to avoid the constant intense desire to violently commit suicide. I fight it by trying to think hard about my family and friends and dog and all the good things in life I have to life for, but I am tired of fighting my own brain this hard every single moment of the day. There are many many days where it feels like I reach my absolute breaking point and I think Im going to do it. UT HEN If I let a couple of hours go by or smoke some weed, I feel fine? Great even! But thats the thing, I never really know when thats going to end. I dont know the next time Ill feel better, or the next time Ill feel this low. It just kind of hits me and catches me off guard every single time. I have always had intense emotional problems even since early childhood, and I recall having suicidal ideations at even like 5 or 6 years old. I have been diagnosed as bipolar 2 a year ago, but I absolutely believe I have a wild case of BD. I have thought that since high school, but only in these recent sophomore and junior years of college have the suicidal ideations have become intense urges. It feels like I have tried every other option to try to feel happy/better but they all either dont work to work for a short time and eventually fail. Ive tried therapy last year for the first time thru my school, it was okay. They put me on 5mg Ability, and that helped a bit seemed. When I was on the mens I would often joke to myself Im glad im on these mens because if I wasnt I was definitely going to kill myself, but I dont take them anymore, my mother was very concerned about all the side effects I was having (random spells of painting or vomiting) and heavily encouraged me to get off it, and she also mentioned that maybe my emotional problems were intensified by the sudden conditions from covid on a teenager (well, I was back then) and that everyone was going through a hard time and that made sense to me so I decided to get off it. I dont think Ill be able to afford it anyway after college. But thats just some side background info. There are times I have blanked and scared myself and thats what makes me feel like my life is in danger sometimes. There was a time last year during an episode I just started stabbing my arm repeatedly with my cuticle nipper manicure tool thing. It broke the skin but they were all obviously very tiny. It always scared me looking back because I think if it was a razor blade or a knife or something it would have killed me. I didnt even know what I was doing. My emotions were so strong and I just started doing it. There was another time this year where during another episode I mindlessly drove to target early in the morning to get a fresh pack of razor blades to cut myself with. I did not realize what I was doing until I got all the way back home and was trying to figure out how to work the razor blade dispenser. It just hit me, wow did I really just get in my car drive 10 mins to target and buy nothing but razor blades,, to cut myself and maybe kill myself with? . This is where I worried I was getting out of control and might actually do it one day, I am scared it is soon. I dont want it to be but I am scared it might be. The urge is so strong there are times I feel no longer in complete control of my actions. I am scared I am checking the boxes for someone who is experiencing a mental health emergency. But I dont know if I really am, or if im just someone who is overdramatic, sensitive, life-inexperienced, privileged, and attention-seeking. There are times I fear that I am being attention-seeking and being manipulative with my emotions, even when I am alone and express them and dont talk to anyone irl about it. That confuses me the most. But I can never really be sure, which leads me to reddit. Sometimes I think back on my thoughts (if that makes sense) and look back at previous questions Ive asked and dont know if they are normal or not. To a degree I know they arent, but I dont know if its really that bad. I am afraid sometimes that if I do kill myself, all these things, along with my search history, music taste, social behavior, substance abuse problem (shit Ill admit it), etc etc are all indicative of someone who is going to kill themselves. I look in the mirror and see someone who is going to kill themselves soon. I dont want to do it. I dont want to do it. I always think to myself am I going to be a suicide statistic? Are these all the inevitable signs and symptoms? Am I about to be one of the 1. 1% of college students to kill themselves? This thought distressed me very much. I have never attempted suicide before. I personally know people and read about people online who have, but when they describe their emotions I do not really relate to them. It seems as though my condition is never really as serious as theirs. Like I said, Ive never officially tried before, these people have, so it makes me think that whatever crazy shit is going on in my head I just need to get over. I wish so desperately that I could do that. I think I am just emotionally weak. You can go back in my post history and see me weird posts. Some I have hidden to avoid ridicule, but I dont know how to get them back. I notice people around me always ask if Im okay if I ever accidentally share the slightest tip of the iceberg of my feelings with them, and the comments I get on reddit posts telling me that I should seek professional help immediately. I was looking on my schools counseling website and they have a whole special section for resources for people who might need Immediate help. Am I really one of those people? Am I experiencing a mental health emergency? Do I need to be monitored in a hospital? There are times I do feel like I am a potential danger to myself, but unlike depressed people, I at least am able to feel great sometimes. When I hear about people who come back from grippy sock vacation (I really fringe at that term but thats what everyone around me seems to use), they mention their trauma and abuses and I didnt really have it as bad as them. I am just sensitive. I come to reddit in desperation. I have never known how to express my feelings on this without accidentally guilt tripping or manipulating people, so I avoid talking about my feelings with people I know irl, outside of therapists. Do I really need help? Like hospital help? Is this an emergency? It feels like one but is it really? Please help me . I dont want to kill myself but I a scared that I might, or am I just being a weird? ",

    "text": "I recently broke things off with a guy I was talking to in January (we were speaking for a few months). Im still hurting massively, waking up every morning thinking about it, having to stay up till Im passing out to sleep and crying about it everyday. At the time, he was having personal issues with his family which came up half way through us talking and he was also moving (to where his ex lived and not because of her). During late December and January, he distanced himself from me because he didnt believe he was ready for a relationship and because he was scared hed hurt me. I assumed he had distanced himself so he could break things off and return to his ex (someone who he had spent 2 years with before talking with me) which is why I broke things off. I found out he got back in contact with his ex and theyre friends now. Ive asked him a couple of times whether or not he wanted to get with her and he said he wasnt sure on the answer himself. I asked him if there was hope for us and he said that he didnt know what the future held. He doesnt want to give me any hope because he doesnt want me to wait only for their a chance that hell be different or have moved on. The past 2 and a half weeks have been hell for me, probably amplified by my period. Ive constantly been thinking about it and being very suicidal as a reaction from us breaking things off. Im trying to get over it and move on but every thought seems to go to it, making me think that this is due to my abandonment and attachment issues. As a kid, my father was an alcoholic and my mother was verbally as well as physically abusive. My mum walked out when I was around 15 and I havent spoke to her since (Im now 19) and I barely speak to my dad. There also the mix of me getting groomed when I was 14 which Im aware has massively affected my outlook on relationships. Im very defensive of my emotions and feelings, wanting a relationship to go well and wanting to avoid being hurt as much as possible.

I hate myself if i'm being true. I dont like the way I procrastinate on my work, i hate how i am, and theres nothing to fix it. I love free time, but I hate doing my work. I wish i was more responsible and maybe I'd be a little less stressed. With so much work and so little time in my head everything I do is last minute, dont ask me why dont ask me why, but it is. I would of killed myself so much sooner from the sheer stress of work i had to do and the assignments i had to finish. Too many things to count and i can never miss an assignment or i would be in trouble. Homework is a trap and i cant leave it and i believe i wouldnt be roaming this earth today if it wasnt for my love. Life isnt bad, but currently isnt too good for me. Wish i got a little support instead of being yelled at. I know they mean well, but you dont have to lie you parents and they dont have to like you. I would love to run off have a stable job and do what I love, but thats so hard nowadays. Too many options so many things to do. I cant get my mind off things and its hard for me to express emotions without driving away the people I like. My parents dont seem to get that i'm trying to do my work, I really am, but every punishment, every time ive been told or hit, i get less enthusiastic about it. They dont see their wrongs even if i point it out to them im the crazy one. Why wont my parents just fight more, talk things out, why cant we be normal. I wish I didnt know so much so I could focus on the important things. Ignorance is truly bliss, ive ruined so many things with my curiosity. I see myself as a monster that no one likes. I would be better off not alive then anything. I still have my suicidal tendency just suppressed because i know someone now that would be truly hurt if i took my own life. Fuck region and everything that comes with it. There no heaven or hell and theres no book to tell you how to live your life. Just live being who you are and lie every now and then to get what you need. Kill yourself if there isnt an escape, because life is a bitch and only so many people can be stuck in an endless loop of nothingness. These are the thought in my head everyday written out for i can read, may the grammatical errors show that this is just spontaneous writings, because this is truly how i feel, how i may be, who I am. There a lot to life, but I don't see mine being worth more than ant. Back to the topic at hand I have so much to do so little time graduation is around the corner and I hope I can manage. So little time so much to do and this isnt a suicide note, just a note for my brain to express emotions that have been suppressed for years and finally started to open up again. I barely gotten the chance to think this way with so many intrusive thoughts. Im just another kid walking the hallway, just another kid who exists in the world of numbers and problems. Even if I killed myself, maybe I'll be a part of a statistic that means more than my life. I play games to hide my thoughts, I play them to get away from problems and issues, I play them to remind me how happiness can be. ",

    "text": "Hi Everyone,. I have been mentally spiraling about an issue that I can't stop obsessing about its driving me into a deep depression. Its going to sound quite dumb but it won't stop bothering me. So I have always kind of been a social person, I use to have Facebook yrs ago but when Instagram became the new thing I never made it and basically have no online presence. I use to not really care but I recently came out of a deep depression (with the help of mens) and I find myself feeling really disconnected. I am also bit older now (early and now realizing it's a good way to stay connected with people as friends begin losing touch with age. I am usually pretty anxious, hate taking pictures, and find social media really superficial (which is why I never used) but now feeling really left out on people's life and wondering if people think I'm a loser that I don't have instagram or any online presence? . You can basically only contact me if you're really close to me and have my phone number, so most people have no idea what's going on with me or if I'm even still alive. Also I was out with friends I haven't seen in a long time this weekend and everyone was taking pics and posting made me feel like an outsider and that I'm missing out on memories. I've been obsessively thinking about this, do people think I'm a loser because I don't have instagram or social media? Especially because it's so common now and we are moving into a digital age, is it weird I have no online presence? . I have thought about creating an instagram so I dont keep letting this bother me but like I said I hate and get anxiety about pictures and feel it would seem really embarrassing and superficial for me to make one now when I was social guy and then post a bunch of fake/superficial/forced pictures. I clearly have some self-esteem issues, sometimes I wish I lived in different times when people didn't feel this social pressure to have social media. Am I kind of a loser because I don't have instagram? Is there a way to not let this bother me so much? . It's really messing with my confidence/self-esteem/making me feel depressed. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks! ",

For example I tried to basically cut out added sugar and junkfood, because it forces me to stop binge eating. Also, on top of 4 hours sports practice every week, I now try to work out at least 30min each day at home. Being exhausted kind of forces me to eat and if I did an exercise and get the happy hormones know the correct term since english isn't my first language), that kinda distracts me from the whole situation.

    "text": "It has been just over three years since one of my nearest friends passed away following a long battle with mental health issues. During that time I have felt strong emotions, but I've never cried in-front of anyone and do my best to submerged those feelings deep down. However, on Saturday, at my Sister's wedding it finally happened. My Brother-in-law was giving his speech, thanking those who attended, and then he began to tear up thanking those who couldn't be there. While he didn't say by name, we all knew that he meant one of his closest friends who passed away a year ago to terminal illness. Despite being in-front of so many people, he allowed himself to cry and then took a minute to compose himself before finishing his speech to a huge amount of applause. Immediately at that point I could already feel the lump in my throat, and when I saw him after the speeches we embraced and both let out a little cry about how proud his friend would be. It downed on me at that moment that so many more people are feeling the same things I've been feeling, and that showing emotion is no weakness, but instead the action of a strong person. You need to let those emotions out. It felt good to finally do that. While my friend may not be at my wedding (if I have one), I will always be grateful for the impact he had on my life, and I will always carry him with me in my thoughts. ",

    "text": "I just dont know. Im out of therapy, therapist suggested that i should find somebody else which im trying, but its quite long run so i have now time to think about if is therapy right for me. And i dont know for sure. My goal is to be well. Issues stacked up to the point that i felt i have no longer power to be solve them on my own. So i reached for help. As child i was diagnosed or my mum was told that i have DD, that was the reason i went a year late to school. It was told to her that i will grow up from it. I think that i have never grew up from it. I always thought that im dumb or something for not keeping up with long explanations. High school was hard for me (still not finished). So one day i just remembered about this DD things. I read about how people were diagnosed with DD/ADHD then they topped on medication and the combination of therapy and drugs made them happy. That was exciting to me to heard that kind of stuff, that the solution si that easy. My other issue was anger. It never cured to me that i have anger issues, well i dont know if that is completely true, i just never knew that my anger issues would be so great that i could be mean to my dog. The dog that i was supposed to protect. I wanted to change, so i will not hurt him anymore. These were the key motivations to search for help. I thought that therapy would be the place to get help. I had expectations that weren met in therapy. I thought that the diagnosis is important part of therapy, but i was proven wrong. My psychologist said that some diagnosis can be made during our time together, but is not the main thing in therapy. She said that therapy is environment where is looked on patient as an individual with individual needs, and there is no much need to name every individual need that the patient have. And even if that sound nice, i wan not satisfied with the answer. I mean there is also diagnosis and diagnosis. I thought that diagnosis is the first step to get help. Lets talk about ADHD. I though that soon as i get diagnosed we would try to focus on things that may improve my symptoms, which could be talking schedules, systems and stuff like that or eventually medication. I dont know if im wrong from wanting to get better fast. And i dont know my requirements are that high. I mean i would though that if someone think that they may have ADHD, it would be best to diagnosed them and then try to help them if they have ADHD. I dont know, i just dont wanted to get help after multiple years of talking in therapy about how im struggling, if you know what i mean. Because of my english i cant really describe well what im trying to say. So now im thinking that i should rather get diagnosed and then hop on therapy. I dont know. Its wo weird. I would just thought that i would find help in one person. My other issues are: emptiness, selling that i dont truly enjoy anything, addictive behaviour, just not functioning in world full of responsibilities, identity crisis - nothing defines me-feelings that im no one, social anxiety, anxiety, weird attachment issues and so on. I honestly thing that i may have BD. I dont know i also need to be diagnosed with it. Maybe thats part of my identity crisis that i want to be someone, like someone with BD or ADHD or Social Anxiety. But i just read about so many people that are diagnosed with deppresion, bad, add and other stuff that im kinda jealous that i cant be one of them, or why is it so easy for them to know what exact problems they have. I just want to know what i should do. I think that i need therapy. Im going through something that could be called and i never felt this shitty before. But i also feel that i need other things that i dont know if therapy could provide. What do you think? ",

    "text": "ok so i have this bio teacher at school who knows I've been struggling a lot and she's talked to me for like 40 mins before, and also today. we talked but i didnt tell her what was wrong with me but i ended up telling her because i felt like it. however i kinda of regret it because there's the the issue with me being depressed for a long time is because i have attachment and abandonment issues and i had a teacher who i was sm attached to, leave me. i was 12. i couldnt get through it and then 4 months ago another teacher i got super attached to left. so i fell into the worst depression of my life. now im doing a lil better thanks to mens but still. i told her this and she didnt react any badly or underestimate the problem but didnt really seem to validate me either, i couldnt feel like she understands that even tho it seems small, it is a big thing for me. she told me to think like they were good people and not something more. and stop getting attached to as if it's too easy and i do it myself. i know she really means to help cup she's talked to me over an hour at total about this (before and now combined) and trying her best to help me but i still feel like if i didnt tell her the problem, shed think its something that is and see my struggle more. it's as if she'll now be like it's not even a big problem they're and wont care as much. or just think badly. this makes me want to cut more and deeper (ive been cutting less deeper but i start to wanna go deep) and just cause some serious damage so i can be valid enough and show my hurt is really big for me. id i just needed to vent and please tell me what you think on this subject, dont just say kind words just because i want to hear it but pls be honest. thank you Happy_face_or_smiley .

    "text": "Does anyone else just feel at such a loss with their head and mental health? I feel like no matter how good my life is going my anxiety forces me to worry about literally anything. Like, things should've got better for me last August when things I was worried about all got sorted out and I couldn't believe everything I was worried about was now ok. However, the opposite happened, instead of me feeling a sense of relief instead my stupid brain got me to endlessly focus on the next things to worry about. I do remember it always being like this but recently it has got S much worse. Like, it used to be little things I would worry about like: passing my driving test, passing my theory test etc etc but now it is things that are ongoing so I have no escape! . One thing that my brain seems to focus on is my cat and if she's happy/ok I think its due to the bond I have with her and how much I love her but I am just constantly worried about her. Especially, when we let her outside - she is an indoor/outdoor so only allowed outside when we are home and before it is dark. I can hear her bell the majority of the time and the neighborhood is fairly safe but for some reason every time I can't see her/hear her bell for a split second my brain instantly thinks something's happened. What makes it worse is when we bring her inside once it's dark she then cries endlessly at the door as she wants to go back out and I feel worse because she's meaning. I do have a phone appointment with a mental health charity to figure out what is going to be best for me like therapy, PT etc. but my god - I just needed to let this out as I feel like I am drowning in my own thoughts 99% of the time. I used to have a really close friend and pretty much weekly we would vent to each other and help each other out but since she's got a boyfriend she doesn't have as much time for me so I think that has contributed to my head just blowing up lol. I just feel like my issues might be seen as pathetic but I know that is just me really overthinking it. However, I do feel like family members of mine have made me feel like I'm weak for accepting and following through with getting help. How can they make you feel silly for getting help when they have no idea what it's like living with a brain who is constantly out to get you/bring you down? . I know they say sometimes you just have to ride the wave of anxiety but honestly I am done riding lol. I just want to get better. Thanks for reading guys, sorry to be a owner but just needed to let it out to people who understand. ",

    "text": "Hi Ive had a rough 2 years and learned a lot about myself so I done a summary below but I think its finally time I begin therapy and try fix my mental health hope you can help! . I am codependent who might have traits of Borderline personality disorder or narcissistic, I was bullied most of my life and beaten up every day between year 7 and year 9. My mum was very unwell while I was growing up I would stay awake all night to be there for her. My mum and dad had a divorce and the house life was very toxic, sometimes I would be on my bed with a baseball bat incase I needed to intervene. There was a period when my dad would bully me and be horrible on purpose especially when my mum wasnt around as he would say I was a mummy boy, he wasnt very affectionate towards me growing up always preferred my sister. My mum would kick me out and make me live on the streets on a regular basis because I would advice her the men she was seeing was using her. I turned to drugs and alcohol for many years to try and get rid of the pain I was dealing with at home. I am clean on both for around 7 years though but I went through a terrible period. I would say I think about committing suicide at-least one a month for the last few years. My relationships are very toxic and last a short time. My most recent was a girl with Borderline personality disorder and bipolar and just in the last 8 weeks (its now over) was clinically depressed, deep down I know I attract or pull towards women who need to be helped healed or rescued. I think I try and change them or control them over time or manipulate mate but this is my own speculation. I spend a lot of my time making sure Im there for my family especially my grandad who guilt trips me to see him all the time which I try to do at least once a day and make sure I take him out on Sunday. My family are constantly pushing me to save for a house but Im seriously impulsive I will spend money I do not have and then regret it soon after currently in 12k debt I shouldnt of got myself in but I acknowledge I am extremely impulsive. I have mood swings and try get my own way with my friend group I ignore any advice they give me unless Im leaning towards agreeing with what they say. I feel like I have control and attachment issues. Growing up I was never hands on always the person who would avoid getting dirty (CD and clean) all my family is hands on physical so me being the more mental one I was always made to feel like a black sheep of the family and laughed at for not being like them. I have a massive lack of boundaries. I try to cling to broken relationships Because I hate being alone even though I did stay single for 8 years somehow? Im insecure about my weight my looks everything which makes me have trust issues and leads me to be paranoid. Even most recently I broke up with a girl who I dated for 8weeks I was trying to control her even after we broke up I would wonder if shes with someone I check her activity times on all Social medias I judge how she dresses when going on. - Bad upbringing . - Bad girlfriend habit . - Bad work life choices . - Bad friend picks . - Bad money decisions. - Unhealthy family relationships / issues. - Constant own mental health problems. - In and out of debt. - Impulsive. - Overweight. - Alone. - Sad. - Depressed. - Controlling.

    "text": "I have ADHD and I am in a relationship with a girl who has BD. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but r/Relationship and r/BPDlovedones are pretty strict/radical with some subjects and will just tell you to break up, even tho that is not an option for us, as we just have some phases/subjects where we clash but 90% of the time we are extremely happy and satisfied with eachother and are roughly two years together now. Now. She kind of has a fear of commitment and when I do something wrong/stupid (which happens more often than I'd like to), she tends to shuts down after a while. On the other hand, I have a fear of abandoned and can't cope with strong feelings or to say it directly: I have problems with strong feelings. I basically get overwhelmed or they get so strong I can't manage them and break down (not always but feelings like insecurity, sadness and in some cases anger are very strong). So. Recently she wanted to meet with a friend of hers and they wanted to meet that Saturday at night in the city to go eat and maybe drink something. Now, this didn't happen until a week later and here's where the problem started. First, I didn't realize that they would be out that late, for her it was obvious because they would meet at about 20:00 (8pm) so she assumed I knew it would be 1 or 2 in the morning when we would get home. We said that I would come at some point to spend some time together and take her home so she doesn't have to be in train and subway alone for half an hour on the way home. Second, they wanted to smoke something and go eat and maybe drink too and there I lost it basically. She went out with someone I didn't know, to smoke weed, eat and drink in the middle of the next big city until late in the day/early in the morning and I didn't know how to cope. I started to be stressed immensely and feel bad because I couldn't cope with this (for what I know) generally seen as normal situation. I had a annoying day at work and the emotional disaster earlier so later when I went there, I got pissed because I couldn't find where they were and had to call her. When I finally arrived at the place, I didn't see them. There I got more annoyed, because she just told me they would go eat something and next thing they are on top of a parking building between various groups of people drinking and smoking. I was annoyed even more and after getting up there and seeing her stoned was like a stab in the heart. I am probably overreacting but I had a problem with that. I wanted to do that with her again for weeks but always got a no or something came in between, but apparently didn't communicate it clearly so she didn't really know. Second, I want to experiment and experience everything I can with her, and basically don't feel the need to do some things with other people without her and at the same time don't want to. And smoking is one of these things. It hurt seeing her like that and as she told me after, she would probably feel the same way, but basically doesn't stop herself because of feelings like that, which also hurt. I basically ruined the rest of the night for her, because I arrived pissed off and hurt and even after I calmed down, the tension was there and she couldn't really be there completely. I feel horrible for ruining her rest of the night, because I can't cope with little things like these and feel like a stab in the heart. I hate that my first thought when she told me how she and her friend went walking in the city by the river and smoked there was don't we ever do things like I am a jealous, insecure person with a strong sense of protecting people I care about and I am very monogamous. She needs a lot of freedoms that I feel like I can't give her because they would break me. She is interested in an opener relationship and wants to experience everything she can, but I go crazy over a lot of these things and just can't comprehend why anyone would do/want that and I makes me crazy. Even little things like smoking with someone hurt a shit ton and I want to stop feeling this way. I want to stop restricting her and feel like I create all the problems in out relationship. ",

And thats where my grandma told my 2nd elder sister about it, at first she told me why im too young for this for that (for an example such as, supplement, lifting heavy, thats all i could think of brush) after that i still told them i still want to go to the gy, and my sister sarcastically refused. I was mad, so i raised my voice at her saying will go to the and thats where i made a and she yelled at me saying dare you raised you're voice at And we were just spitting nonsense word at each other. Until she said one sentence that left me thinking but also mentally hurt me. like our or wrong you want to be our After she said it, i was confused but mad. I asked her why would she uses our uncle as an excuse (or an example) on me. But unfortunately she was stressed out, so she started banging her head on the wall and throw her phone, she started crying, so my grandma started to comfort her, while she was comforting her. I sat down and sailed while i cried, i tried to hold my cry so i cried silently with a smile. After that my sister who was stressed goes upstairs, and both of my sisters and my grandma confront me. And that was all. To me i felt alone cup nobody backed me up instead, but i also because. They were right, and thats the reason why i felt alone and stupid, because they were right, ofcourse they were right. And if you guys don't know why my sister used our uncle on me. Well heres the truth about my uncle. My uncle has been emotional and mentally abusive to my sisters and my grandma (including me) and has been physically abusive to my animals (cats and dogs) so yea.

This is my first post, I don't really know what I'm doing but I really need to vent. I've always been an A+ student throughout my life. I then moved to a different country (at 11 years old) with a completely different language than mine, and I struggled a lot until I was able to get back on my feet school-wise (I wasn't able to get grades/I got bad grades in the beginning cup I didnt know the language at all). I am now in a private school with a scholarship (my mom couldnt afford the school so I worked really hard to get this scholarship), and its my fifth and last year. I've always excelled at everything, while also being way too anxious and worried about my grades. I always had the worst feeling after, before and during tests because I was so afraid of failing (which has never happened. until now lol). I have a hard time accepting any grade under A (same thing as a here where I live). But recently, I've not been as motivated to study or to do anything for school at all. I was keeping a 1. 0 PA throughout the whole year, because I want to finish my last year of school with excellence so I can get accepted into a good uni. But now, the second semester, I've gotten 1 B and 2 Cs on exams, which has brought some those grades to Bs. I actually dont know what to do - I cannot stop crying and feeling like a failure, I even thought about something I shouldnt even write down on here. Its been really hard for me, because I quit everything I enjoy for school. These past 5 years Ive only been focusing on expelling and getting a great career, and now in my last year, last semester even, Ive completely messed things up and I dont have time to fix them (theres 2 weeks left of school and then I have my final exams in a few weeks). I just wanted to ask if anyone else feels the same way, because I cant stop shaking or crying because of this. I really wish school was a place of learning for me, but it has become my own personal hell. Thanks for reading! ",

Yet, the truth is that I feel like Pinocchio - acting like one, but not really being the person I aspire to be. So, actually, here's my revised question:. How does one become a better person? Is there a way for me to make my feelings match with my rationale? Or is following the same track of doing what I only think is right the best way to go forth? ",

And she would often times compare me to her son, with something along the likes of, aren't their family's like or wish her son was mine instead of . And even though she doesn't bring it up even with our arguments now, the words still ring out on my head and it hurts every time I see her co-workers son at school. (We go to the same school, and we are in the same class). Maybe it's some kind of TSD for me or trauma? Since it's already automatic on my mind whenever I see him everyday or hear his voice and it hurts. I know some of you may say, why don't you try to be close to him or befriend him? The problem is, I tried. And I guess he isn't interested to be friends with me, with our discord only lasting about a few weeks before I understood he just didn't care for me. Sometimes, I'm starting to believe what she said to me all those years ago. At school, he's pretty much an honor student, lots of friends, and without any mental illness. Unlike me, being the exact opposite. I'm basically weird, bullied, talentless and sometimes, I just don't wanna go to school for the sake of it. I'm autistic, slow processing and clumsy. It's terrifying how hurtful words can sometimes be, and mind you, that was over 17 years ago. I know deep inside I need to just let go and move on. But I can't help but feel that maybe, it's true. That even my mother doesn't want to have me as my son, even though we're not in any form of conflict everyday. Please, help someone out, this has been going on for years now. And I think it's taking a toll on my life, I can't talk to this in real life, since I don't really have anyone to talk around my household but my parents. And whenever my mom just hears about this, she fucking flips out and doesn't continue the conversation. I mean, she's never the understanding kind. She even berates me for self harming or opening about thoughts of suicide. Still she's my mother, and even with this shit, I still kind of care for her. ",

Im thinking about going, but I dont want to be trapped ini decide I would like to leave. I was placed in one for an attempted suicide by overdose years ago, and was told I would only be there for a week. I was doing slot of Xamax at the time, and had liquid alprazolam that I put on dummy bears and actually was able to hide them in a envelope and hid them in tucked under my shit. They striped me down to ky underwear and I just acted like I was cold and shivering and managed to get them in no problems. I had enough to last me Polly two weeks no problem but as I said I only Planned on being there for a week so I rationed them for a week and just got really barred out and chilled in my bunk reading books all day. After my week came and went, I had a meeting with the doc and she said since all Ive done is read books and havent partake in any programs at all that I was gonna have to stay another fucking week. The next three days were some of the hardest days of my life man started having a bunch of seizures and it was terrifying. The staff there was overwhelmed and understaffed. I was too afraid to admit the real reason behind my seizures and after the third or fourth one they finally let me go on my third day as I was begging to become a liability. Thats my spec on the time I went to the damn ward. Im thinking about checking myself in to one , for multiple reasons but honestly my mental health hasn been the best. What I would like to know is will I be able to leave whenever I want if I check myself in instead of having a doctor force me to go? I have health insurance, would I be better off going to a private one instead if a state ran one? And would it make a difference on when Im able to leave? Thanks alot guys!

My grades are dropping, it's so hard to get out of bed, my energy has gone to an all-time low and so has my mental health. I feel like I'm pushing my friends away. I just can't match their high energy so I push myself. It is so exhausting keeping in all the frustration and pain while you also have to worry about the next test and the essay that's due in 45 minutes. Teachers yelling at me to get my shit together while I slowly rumble. I was basically told by one of the teachers I was stupid. I just wanna punch someone in the face or just cut myself so deep. I haven't harmed myself and don't intend to but I have these thoughts of me just digging a knife into my skin when frustrated. I want help but fear people thinking I'm just faking it all. I've been made fun of it before. I want to talk to one of my friends about it. The problem about that is how do I just randomly bring up suicidal thoughts and other depressing problems. I don't want to just ruin the mood. Something else that has been fucking me up was when I found out that my friend told a guy that I liked him. He didn't like me and that's not the problem. The problem was that my friend said that he said that my laugh was annoying and that I was annoying. My friend also says that from time to time the guy brings me up and says She so annoying right? . To add to the dogshit pile I had a group project with him. Since he ignores me I felt like a fucking ghost in the project. I was being constantly ignored by my other team members and him. During that project, one of my teammates was using a box cutter. I spaced out and had thought of harming myself. A serious thought. That scared me to my core after I realized what I just thought of. After that point my life became horrible. Every day now feels just meh. The days feel so short and pointless. I can still experience happiness and joy but it never lasts long. If I have a minor problem that would be looked over by someone normal my brain makes it into such a big problem. I feel like everyone hates my guts and finds me annoying. I hate my body and my face. I want this feeling to disappear. I don't want to die I just feel that others want me dead. Please tell me this is going to all go away one day. ",

I agreed and was with him for 3 days until I was found. In those 3 days, I was only allowed to shower once. We had sex constantly even after my body truly couldnt take anymore.

For years, I couldnt see that part of my life for what it was. I just saw it as me being a stupid 16 year old who was overweight and desperate for any kind of affection from a man. And now, at nearly 28, Im realizing the actuality of it. I was groomed. I was preyed upon. I was raped. I was broken down and reformed into what he wanted me to be. He convinced me to say awful untrue things about my dad. (Luckily nothing happened to my dad and our relationship has been rebuilt. ). My mom still blames me for running away.

When I was born my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck and I was dead for almost two and a half minutes (1) scans show damage and malformation of the frontal lobe, brain stem and some core centers of the brain I have more white matter in areas than most but less grey matter and vice versa weird thing how my brain was wired when I was 7 (2) an adult version of a medicine given to treat what was thought to be tourettes syndrome stopped my heart then again when I was 8 (3) unknown if any lasting damage was done this results in a lawsuit against the now defunct sco drug company when I turned 11 I was put into a hospital and given a combination of medicines they referred to as a This stopped my heart (4) and I remember having quite the out of body experience even seeing my self being resuscitated pretty cool on the whole but I digress I had a bout of bad times and took my own life or rather gave it my all first time I was in a coma with zero brain activity after they restarted my ticker but managed to pull through that (5) when I was 27 I tried again and they brought my back somehow (6) when I was 28 I gave it a good shot and though I was dead in the ambulance they got me going again before we got to the hospital (7) when I turned 29 I hit hard times and went all out putting myself in another coma for almost 2 weeks (8) when I was 27 I was rear ended and the airbag malfunctioned causing me to hit my head rather hard causing a TB to my frontal lobe and a good amount of spinal damage things really changed then and when I look back it was the point when the hill started going doooooooowwwwnnnnnnn imo besides all that I cracked my skull open from various accidents 5 times before I was even 9 years old . sooooooo tld my brain is probably pretty sucked up medically speaking in terms of chemical messaging and just general operation my dreams changed also and became more intense and recurring if you will my entire life has become a maze since all this happened and now the cherry on the sunday I was diagnosed with C-TSD due to massive amounts of trauma early on and throughout most of my life along with some some shit called depersonalization-derealization disorder and that one is a hopper it is one of the most terrifying experiences I ever have when those kick on so now I am left broken and trying to function in a world that I no longer fit into and am lost I have died 8 times in my life recently I lost my best friend who was pretty much my son to cancer I was in another car accident a few weeks before that happened and I feel like I was supposed to die in that accident but didn't and ever since that reality has felt like its breaking down nothing anyone can say I feel will help as I am not unable to care for myself and have a therapist etc but words they never do anything and I have heard just need to give it for the last 27 years of my life . I feel this is desperation in the physical form as I know I won't get an answer that will help but I am at the point where hope and luck are the fuel in my tank so you be the judges. way.

We see eachother once a month and I love him very much and when we are together, I am satisfied with our relationship. But, I am booming with two other girls. These girls also have boyfriend, at our college. I like these boys, we are all friends, but they are constantly in the room. I tell myself if I can just find the mental peace in myself, then I would be okay with them being there. They are busy during the day so the guys are normally in the room exclusively at night, and I love my roommates they are my best friends and I dont even know where to begin to set boundaries with this situation. I just get discouraged to do my work with all these guys in the room, I just wish I could ignore them and not feel this way, I struggle so heavily with productivity as it is. Does anyone have any advice on how to increase productivity, to focus on ones self? I just want to focus on myself and bid away these bad emotions I just wish I knew how. Sorry if this is all confusing. As im typing this literally all four of them are in the room right now.

But two things that never fail to make me absolutely fucking furious are having my boundaries disrespected, and being women up too early. And my family refuses to stop doing either. I know it sounds really stupid and whitney to get this upset about it but it drives me fucking insane. Ive had sleep problems my whole life and it has always been EXTREMELY difficult for me to fall asleep. Especially after being women up. I have made this explicitly clear to them, and for the most part they stopped doing it. Now recently we got kittens, sometimes they sleep in my room and other times in the lounge. Usually in the week I feed them around 6 Happy_face_smiley . 0am because Im getting up for the day, so they know thats breakfast time. If its the weekend however, they sleep in the lounge and I leave out food in the night for the SPECIFIC REASON that I dont need to get up to feed them then and I get to sleep. For some reason my parents just dont get it and think Im being neglectful. So every morning at 6am they open my door to let the cats into my room. I cannot describe how fucking angry this makes me. I have told them quite literally over 50 times to not come into my room while I am sleeping and to not wake me up this early for no reason. And I cant go back to sleep because of how angry I feel every time. I get like this pumping feeling of adrenaline or something in my chest and I cant do anything but lie in bed and try really hard to calm down. All Ive asked of them is to leave me alone. I dont understand what is so hard about that. I just want to sleep. ",

I know that I need help and need to talk to someone professionally. I know this and am actively seeking help going with BetterHelp).

The pandemic has allowed me to coop up in my home for so long that I have little desire to go out, and therefore rarely socialite (unless I talk to my partner (31 years old, male) who I live with). I've been struggling with food, either over or under indulging, ordering fast food for the past few weeks for dinner and sometimes lunch. And I also get high every day, to feel even a little bit okay about life (and to feel physically better, as I seem to get sick more than most people I know and also deal with chronic pain). I've honestly had thoughts of hopping into my car and disappearing. Multiple times. I don't really care about a lot of things, and am struggling to find motivation to care. I can't barely even find kindness towards myself right now, because I don't feel okay. Not at all. I'm just one huge mess all bundled up into wrapping paper and topped with a bow.

    "text": "In December I was feeling increasingly suicidal and I had been self-harming intermittently. One time my roommate/friend (in the friend group) saw me with a razor in my hand after they heard me crying in my room and asked if I wanted to come out. Things didn't get much better from there. Later on that month after dissociating for an entire night in a dance competition I was in (I have severe performance anxiety and one time ran out of of the middle of practice when I felt a panic attack coming on) I came back to the party at my house and drank a ton of alcohol and rapidly smoked weed with someone. I just remember knocking back glasses of liquor and taking rapid puff of a joint, like I was being controlled by an invisible force set on the intention of getting myself into a deplorable state. I remember really hating myself that day, and I wanted to dig myself deeper into the hole I'd begun to dig. I wanted people to hate me, I wanted a reason to justify my own self hatred. I blocked out and vomited on the carpet in front of multiple people thereafter. I remember deliriously asking for an ambulance. My consciousness went in and out and hours later I was in the hospital. They sent in a assessment where a psychiatrist determined I had BD- just like my mother, who my father always compared me to whenever I showed any kind of intense emotion. I'd been called crazy, dramatic, and parasitic all my life by him. The sinking feeling I felt in my chest was horrible. I have a lot of trauma from my emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive household. I'm still recovering from the amount of I got while I was growing up. I felt even worse for my friends- they'd seen my mental health deteoriate. I wasn't the happy, witty friend they had before, I was something else: I became volatile, bitter, lonely, and angry. I think on the outside that's how I was perceived, but deep down I just hated myself. What hurt was that nobody asked how I was or how I felt after coming back from the En. F, the friend who picked me up from the hospital, would later go onto telling E that I got diagnosed with BD. Upon coming home I tried to apologize to P, my roommate at the time, who freaked out and said sorry but I can't fucking deal with you right . After the hospital I guess they were done with me. They stopped inviting me to come hang out with them, and on the rare occasion they did, they always acted uncomfortable or didn't bother talking to me. At best I'd get one-word responses or general disinterest in whatever I was talking to them about. I tried hard to be the cheerful person I once was, but I was feeling more lonely than ever. I asked one friend, F, what was wrong, and he said nothing was wrong but everyone walked on eggshells around me. I talked about how conflicted and alienated I felt and how I still felt horrible. He said a real . He stopped texting me and would leave my texts on read. I tested another friend, E, about what had gone wrong and she said something was going on but she'd talk to me about it. She never tested me again after that. My ex-roommate and friend P, who I'd had living conflicts with (they were really messy, I was really clean) responded with that's your after I told them how I didn't feel comfortable in our friend group anymore. I stopped texting after that, because nobody would respond to our groupchat anymore. I moved on and have only two friends now but I've been feeling better, much more emotionally and mentally independent and stable. I'm seeking treatment. I just feel like I deserved this catastrophe, that I was finally getting the treatment I'd deserved at that time. Something in the back of my mind tells me I'm a chaotic freak, I'm toxic and I deserved all of this to happen. I feel like in their eyes I was no longer their friend struggling with depression and anxiety, I had become the person to stay away from. My therapist says I don't have anger issues (as I used to believe), and says that I'm struggling with emotional regulation in the face of severe PTSD, instead of being a I don't know.

I also think about how till affect people and how till feel but then my mind just goes to saying it wont matter cup Ill be dead, I wont feel anything and I wont care. I dont really have anyone to talk to about these things so it stays bottled up for ever. The one person I could talk to I dont really ever want to bring it up because Im always in a better mood when Im around her but I dont want to bring the mood or her down with the talk of me killing myself.

For almost a year I started instantly bursting out in tears at the thought of growing up, just no matter where I was, I could be watching a movie with my dad and just start crying my eyes out in a pillow trying to hide my eyes and weeks. I would cry in the shower, in school, in public, just always start crying at these thoughts. It took a long time for me to get over this. Ive always and still am a kind of person who doesnt like to express any negative feelings, and no matter how mad or sad Im feeling I always try to be positive to everyone else, I dont want my negative emotions to bleed onto anyone, so i pretty much faced all my problems alone which Im fine with, never went to a therapist, never talked to anyone in my family or friends about it, I just tried to suck it up and put it down as me just being weak or being a baby about it. So years later can someone diagnose me, Ive always wondered about the weird emotions I felt, after this moment I move tried my hardest to never cry in any situation to the point where even when a family member passes away I would be sad, just never cry or come close to it. Its like I number myself, even physical pain doesnt make me cry. This took a long time for me to decide on posting this on here, but I figured no one here knows me so I shouldnt have any problems.

He wants to leave the relationship and I know I should let him, but I begged him to stay and I don't know why.

I want to get better, but it's so hard to get started because it feels like the feeling of darkness will never leave. I could expand on this more, as I know there's so many actions/paths I can take here in both situations, but all seem painful.

I got diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD in 8th grade and got put on mens and it helped with shit like school but Im now realizing it didnt help with everything. My family went through some very tragic shit when I was a baby. My cousin was kidnapped and killed, my earliest memory is her funeral. Because of this, and the stress of being a teen mom, my moms anxiety basically doubled. She was very protective, I didnt sleep in my own room until I was 13/14 because she couldnt sleep if she couldnt see me, and I couldnt sleep if I couldnt see her. I spent years convinced that every stranger I saw wanted to hurt me, and I know that may not sound bad, kids shouldnt talk to strangers, but I think it may have had a negative impact on my adult brain. I am very paranoid, I check the backseat of my car every time I get in (even in broad daylight) and even then Ill still feel 100% sure theres someone back there and be white knuckling the wheel, every time I have to take my dog out at night Im breaking out and constantly looking over my shoulder and shaking and hyperventilating by the time I get inside, I get these sudden waves of extreme fear where I feel like Im in danger and something is chasing me (even if Im home with my mom in the daylight) and I have to sprint to put my back against a wall. This morning, I was laying in bed, just starting to wake up, and I hear a loud banging and crash come from downstairs. I was frozen with fear and it felt like my blood turned to ice, I was 100% convinced someone had broken down our door and was in our house. I wanted to go to my moms room to wake her up but I was to scared to move so I just laid there, shaking and crying for almost an hour before I realized nothing was happening. When I went downstairs, nothing was out of place, and when I asked my mom about it later she said she didnt hear anything. I just want to stop being afraid.

I was the younger commas boy so I had taken my moms side on almost everything. Me and my sister hated each other, she bullied me harshly, degrading my mental state from an early age. Being me I allowed it, after all she was still my sister, just like how I deal with my mom still today. Anyway my sister hated me and I had a bat shit insane asylum patient for a mother. The worst of it was when I was in Jr high. 7th-8th grade. I was severely depressed, I hated myself, I thought I was just gonna end up crazy like my mom. Things changed dramatically when she went to move with her rich boyfriend and left me and my sister to my dad who is great btw. She left for 3+ years which coincidentally were the best years of my life. But some shit happened and after all that she came back. Im now 17 and a Junior in High school. When she came back feelings, memories, emotions. immediately started pouring back. All the shit she put me and my sister through just scraping the inside of my skull. As time went on from when she got home about a year ago things have just been getting worse inside my head. I got a pocket knife last Christmas thinking it would be cool to have, but on long nights I would glance over at the knife sitting there, thinking about using it, thinking about cutting it into my shoulder, just to feel something. At first it was scary, but then it got easier to do. I had cut my shoulder multiple times. I havent dont it for awhile. I put the knife somewhere else. This last week has been super hard, Ive been tired all day, I just lie in my bed. I fall asleep during the day which I never used to do. I feel worse than ever, tired of life. I think this is it, I hate it here, whats the point? Am I meant to just work my whole life just to die anyways? See people treat each other like shit? If anything I might just go out into the wilderness and try to survive but if I die I die. Yes Ive tried to get help, Ive talked to my dad about it which was really hard for me, I dont talk much, I dont tell people how I feel nor do I really show much emotion. My dad doesnt believe in that sort of stuff, he thinks Im just fine and that therapy is just a scam where people tell you whats wrong with you and give you a pill. My mom on the other hand is supportive, she is much better now although she still drinks. She wants me to go to therapy. So I feel stuck, just laying here in my bed, typing things that Ill never be able to say out loud. Everyone thinks Im happy and just fine but they are truly blind to how much Im struggling. They ask How are you doing? And my answer is always just good. I dont talk to them at all, I just hope they see my suffering soon. ",

I don't feel human half the time and I have a hard time connecting with a lot of people but when i don't connect with people its quite normal so it feels contradictory. I have been stuck in a weird is a relationship is not a relationship with someone for the past 8 years. Someone i care about but not someone that i romantically love. I gave into their advances years ago when i was still quite young and coping with a lot. I was abused a quite a bit as a child mentally and sexually to an extent when i was very young and i have an untreated and warped view of sex, and love. I gave into the advances because i thought i would feel more like a woman if i did. this was a problem of mine for years that i eventually learned was not the right way to look at these things but by then it was years into a not relationship/ but relationship. I don't know if im being gaslit or not nonstop. if I go anywhere it feels like im ruining this other persons life and if i stay im cool with hanging out but the more i have to sleep in the same bed the more i have to hang out nonstop the more i have to be in the same room the more i wish i was just fucking dead. if i try to go out anywhere he makes me feel bad. I cant get a job without excuses i cant get my own car without excuses i cant have my own room without excuses. i have lately at random for the past few years just exploded on myself and lack sleep. lately when i explode i have been scratching my skin up to the point of bleeding. i have been dissociating a lot more and just feel sucked beyond belief. io want out so bad i want to escape so bad but i dont fucking know how. everything i try seems to make things worse.

    "text": "Warning this is going to be a pretty long post but I hope you read all of it. Ok. So I don't know where to begin this so I guess I will just start out by saying that I'm currently a senior in high school. I've never really been the most social person growing up as I've always had few friends and I would always find it difficult to form new friendships. Especially in school, I find that everyone is kind and generally friendly towards me yet I feel like all my fellow classmates consider me more as an acquittance than a genuine friend and this goes both ways. I especially feel this when we do group projects and I'm always scrambling to find someone to work with as everyone partners up immediately once the project gets announced. It's not that I've not tried to make more friends as when I was new to the school in ninth grade I made an effort to talk with the kids in my grade and attempt to form friendships but it was to no avail. I noticed how despite my attempts at talking to them it didn't make a difference as I never felt like I was truly developing any friendships but rather that they were just being nice to me and responding to what I was saying. Halfway through ninth grade I kind of gave up on actively making friends as I threw myself into my school work. I always said to myself that I'll start making friends and hanging out with people once I get all straight A's in my classes as once that I've conquered the academic aspect of high school I will be able to move on the social aspect of high school. Plus, in my head I knew that I wouldn't see the majority of these people after high school so I didn't mind that I wasn't friends with many of them. Recently, though one of my classmates died in a car accident and the whole grade attended his funeral. I, myself did not know this person that well but I saw how everyone in my grade was in tears over this person's death. The person who died was generally popular within the grade and had been in the school district since kindergarten while as previously mentioned I moved in ninth grade. Yet, the thing that occurred to me while at the funeral was that if I would have died in that car accident in the place of my fellow classmate would anyone of my fellow classmates care that I was gone compared to him. I honestly believe that while the students and even teachers would be sad it would be no where near as much as the sadness they felt for my fellow classmate. Why is that I thought. Well the most obvious answer would be that they simply knew him way better than they knew me as he had many friends and was apart of many different clubs. While, I was apart of a few clubs yet despite only being in a few clubs (three to be exact) I tried many different clubs throughout high school but none of them fit. As I was never interested in Debate, Model Up, or Science Olympiad despite attending multiple meetings for each club. Also, to be honest apart of me didn't like that the amount of public speaking that was involved with each of these clubs. Now let me say that I've sang individually in front of tons of people on numerous occasions and I kind of like the idea of being the center of attention for a brief moment in time. Yet, for some reason when I was in these clubs I was so afraid of actually speaking as I was afraid of what others may think and that they may consider me to be dumb or stupid. Going back to school, now that I'm towards the end of my senior year and most of my fellow classmates and myself are receiving our college decisions back I feel a bit disappointed as despite me saying that I'm putting one hundred percent focus in my school work and even foregoing many friendships as a result I still only managed to have a 3. 7 unweighted PA with a 1440 AT superscore that only happened after taking the exam six times. Also I underperformed on my A exams in my junior year which is the most crucial year of high school. Alternatively, my peers in school who despite hanging out with friends on weekends and being apart of many different clubs still managed to have a higher PA, standardized test score, and A exam score. To be honest, that made me very angry as despite me only focusing on school there were able to focus on so many other things and yet they were still able to succeed in school more than I did. At school, I always wanted to be known as the person who was really intelligent. I would love when people would complement me on how smart I was even when I knew deep down it wasn't true as I always had to put in more effort than most students to achieve high grades and even when people asked me how I did on tests I would give a superficial smile and say the highest grade I could think of while also being a little realistic. I'd also get very jealous of the kids in the grade as not only were they super popular and part of a variety of clubs but people would always complement them and things came so naturally to them unlike for me. Even today as I hear back from colleges I'm disappointed that my stats were too low for me to gain admission to any legitimate top twenty school. Even schools that I thought I had a good chance of getting into I did not receive admission such as the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, UCLA, and University of Virginia. I know college admissions is based on luck to a great extent but I still feel angry and disappointed that despite putting my all into my studies I still wasn't able to get the grades that I wanted to attend a top tier school. I always figured that I deserved it since I decided to sacrifice so many other aspects of my life. Now I also wanted to touch upon my dreams and aspirations. Ever since I was little I always wanted to be an actor I was mesmerized by actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Johnny Deep, Tom Cruise, etc. I also genuinely had a passion for film and I wanted nothing more than to be apart of the process. I expressed this desire to my parents when I was young and even attended some acting classes in the city but nothing much ever came of it. Since then whenever I brought up my desire to pursue an acting or even singing career they told me that it was ridiculous as I don't have the personality to be an actor or a singer in their eyes because of how I'm very introverted and thus should stick to something more practical. But yet even today I still have desires for an acting career as I spend hours watching films and copying facial expressions of famous actors in order to improve my acting ability. I also spend hours vividly daydreaming about what my life maybe like as an actor. I think about the films that I would star in, the plot and title of each film, the A-list actors that would be in the films, and how successful each of my films would be at the box office and with critics. I know it sounds insane talking about it but I'd also spent time daydreaming about winning an Oscar and what exactly I would say when I'd win and which A-list actors would be present to hear my acceptance speech. I also daydreamed about being apart of a vocal group that I called The group would have eight members including myself (four guys and four girls) and we would all live in a two hundred million dollar Bel-Air estate that I had once seen on Willow. I imagined how I would be filming a movie during the day and then writing music with my fellow members at night. I imagined that I had the most amount of instagram and twitter followers than anyone in the world by a milestone. I also imagined how I would portray the character of Spiderman in a Spiderman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Then I imagined that while portraying Spiderman I will also play Batman in a film series directed by Aaron Sorkin. I imagined myself being warmed by fans on a daily basis more than even Michael Jackson. I also imagined how all the members of will be super famous as well as they will also have the highest instagram and twitter following right behind me. Also each member of will dominate in a specific area within the entertainment industry for me that is acting for the other members that maybe modeling, literary publishing, or directing. I also imagine how out of the four girls of I would date the most popular and beautiful one who would be a brunette and everyone would see us as a bigger power couple than Brangelina. I'd look at brunette girls my own age on Instagram and imagine that they would be the member that I would date. Also the second most beautiful member would be a blonde who would be best friends with the brunette member and both of them would have major crushes on me and I would have to decide which one I'd want to date. I'm sorry if that last paragraph was a lot to read but I really wanted you all to understand what is going on in my head for the last few years especially. Another thing that has bothered me for a while especially since I've joined high school was whether or not I was good looking. I always wanted to be an extremely attractive person as I wanted people to admire my looks the way they do for Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt. I constantly asked my family if they thought I was handsome as I was too afraid to ask any of my friends in fear that they would think I was weird or anyone else for that matter. They would always tell me that I am but I always felt like there was a problem as despite even me thinking that I'm handsome, I never got any attention from girls my own age. Now this could be because I barely interact with girls in my school and when I do it is only for school related matters but I always thought even then that at least a few girls would show some interest in me but nothing of the sort ever happened. Furthermore, it is not like the girls in my school don't have crushes on guys as I've heard them speak about their guy crushes in the past and personally I was shocked as I genuinely believe that I'm way better looking than the guys that they were crushing on. I mean it's not like I have a serious crush on any girl in my school in fact I find most of them to be unattractive with the exception of a handful of girls in my grade. Also in recent years I've grown to have a strong love for teen dramas. Particularly since the beginning of high school I've watched teen dramas such as Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The Secret Life of The American Teenager, Riverdale, The OC, Beverly Hills 90210, The Vampire Diaries, Freaks Geeks, and Euphoria. When I'd watch each one of these shows not only did I obsess over the shows but also the cast as I learned so much about each and every one of their professional and personal lives. I would ship characters from the show and be extremely disappointed if they didn't end up together despite me knowing that at the end of the day it doesn't really matter because these characters don't exist in reality. Also being a guy watching teen dramas made me insecure as no other guy my age that I know of spent this much time on teen dramas as they would be more prompted to watch sports or some other show. Don't get me wrong I do watch other shows as I'm a fan of Cobra Kai which while it does have some teen drama in it, it is more of a karate soap opera than a straight up teen drama. Likewise, I also enjoy watching shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy as I've always found them hilarious. Yet, when watching teen dramas I think what appeals to me the most about them is the fact that they are so different from my life as a high school student. As a current senior in high school I've never taken in any drugs or alcohol my whole life. Due to this at times I catch myself judging people in my school who have taken drugs or alcohol as I believe that I have more will power than them and that I must have a better home life that doesn't make me go towards alcohol and drugs. I also constantly search up celebs using drugs as I realize that similar to classmates I shame them to as I can't understand why anyone would do drugs in the first place. Furthermore, one of the things that disappoint me the most in my life is that I've never had a girlfriend, got laid, or even properly kissed. There was a time when I was eight years old that a girl and I shared a kiss for a second but that is the extent of my sexual experiences. I know that this isn't a big deal as plenty of guys my age have yet to have their first proper kiss as well but I still feel like I missed out on that experience that I should have had when I was young. I told my parents that I wanted to major in business and I'm interested in the business side of the entertainment industry. Additionally, I also said that I could possibly major in Economics and maybe work in an investment banking firm one day. To be honest, the only reason that I would ever want to work in an investment banking firm is so that I could have a lot of money and hopefully retire young and never have to work again. Despite, what I said earlier my parents do want me to pursue my interests as long as it is reasonable. My dad in particular has noticed these past few years that I never really ask for stuff and he always tells me how he is worried about how I'm going to manage in the real world as he thinks I'm too introverted. I believe that while I am indeed introverted I still talk to people and while I don't necessarily go out of my way to make conversation most of the time I still talk confidently when spoken to by an adult or someone my own age. I think my biggest fear is living a life filled with regret. I have been having all these thoughts and emotions for a while now and I really needed a place to vent it all out. Finally, I want to end off talking about some of my physical tico. My family has noticed over the past year that when I listen to a song I really like I would get out of my chair and stand while clipping my hands with my arms fully extended at the front and back of my body while saying back and forth. Also, when I get any test back in school my hands start to get pins and needles as I await for the test results. I've noticed that especially this year I've become increasingly disillusioned with school as every day that I'm in school I'm just waiting to get out of school and go home so that I could sit at my desk in my room and watch animated stories or videos by my favorite youtubers. Don't get me wrong I still complete all my homework and study for tests it's just that while I'm doing that I also am also on Youtube watching different videos for hours on end and thus homework that could have taken half an hour now takes two hours. I also stay awake till midnight on weekdays watching videos after I finished all my work as I don't want the day to get over and go to school again in the morning. My dad always asks me why I'm so introverted as he considers me to be the black sheep of the family opposed to him, my brother, and mother. Till date I don't know the true answer. I notice how a lot of the times in school something funny may happen and while the whole class is laughing I'm the only one having to fake the laughter feeling like an outcast. So if you can please share with me your thoughts that would be greatly appreciated. ",

But holy crap those Christian apologist arguments that are good arguments really freak me out. Out of all of the things that give me anxiety this is certainly at the top of the list. I've contemplated killing myself over this just to find out if I and the rest of humanity are actually going to hell forever because the anxiety of waiting is killing me. I often get triggered when I drive by churches too. I mental state is depressingly, extremely anxious over this. The stakes are just so high. Thank you for reading my venting session. I would appreciate some readback if any is possible. ",

I can't help but to watch videos of him randomly and wind up just crying to the point that I sometimes can't breathe. It just happened and I almost went into a full-blown panic attack. I didn't know him personally and while I've lost loved ones before for some reason I keep coming back to his passing and it devastated me all over again. I don't know how to move on from it and look back with happiness rather than sadness. This sounds so silly to put out on the internet but I legit don't know what you are supposed to do in these situations. I feel like it makes sense to mourn a loved one and it feels disingenuous to mourn a celebrity so heavily. but I miss him in such a weir way and it still upsets me greatly. Any advice or tips? ",

    "text": "Too unrealistic and needy? . IL (40 m) and sister (40 f)say that Im (32 f) too needy in relationships. I expect too much from friendships and my depression makes it hard for people to have relationships with me because its exhausting. I feel nauseous nearly every day and pure at least 3 times a week for no apparent reason. Doctors dont know whats wrong with me. This makes planning in advance difficult. They say Im too sensitive and play the victim (although, not intentionally). I have depression, anxiety, and stomach illness but I feel like Im a good friend and generally fun to be around. I feel like my IL and sister want me to ignore my true feelings and just suck it up and grow up. For instance, I have a friend from college named Annie (31 f). Annie got a boyfriend about 5 years ago and communication lessened pretty abruptly. I had a boyfriend and that didnt prevent me from having a relationship with her. Annie wasnt their for me when I went through a major breakup with said boyfriend. I had just had knee surgery and she didnt offer to help me I was dumped and had to move out all on my own. Annie couldnt find time to meet up before I left state for months due to having such a hard time with break up. She also wasnt there for support when I got back. Just went through a break up again. I asked for her help and she couldnt once again. I ask her to hang out and it has to be some big planned thing. I have bad stomach problems that make scheduling in advance difficult. I do understand that my sickness can be frustrating but I literally have no control over it. There are more examples but Overall she is a fair-weather friend. I moved in with my sister about a month and a half ago and havent hung out with anyone. Ive been feeling very lonely. Last week I asked my long time best friend Marie (31 f) what she was doing for st. Patty day or the following weekend. She said she was doing some ubering for the holiday and had a date Friday. We text most days, so I tested to see how ubering was going. She said that she was done and headed to Detroit to hang out with some other no invitation. Friday rolls around and she said that her date got canceled and if I wanted to hang out. I kinda feel like a back-up plan but decided to push my ego aside and just hang out. We do for about an hour and a half before she decides to leave kinda unexpectedly. Me and recent ex boyfriend (34 m) are close and this is his advice: I disagree (with my IL and sis) you just got to be yourself. If people dont want to hang with you then screw them. Go find some friends who like you for you. Am I too unrealistic about my friendship expectations or do I just need to find different friends who are more supportive? . Do you have a friend with depression who you just cant deal with on a regular basis? . Please be kind. I just want some advice to help me navigate this. ",

    "text": "Last year I had a terrible panic attack that felt like it destroyed my life for six months. Stress caused it. In the weeks leading up to it I started drinking on top of my regular smoking joints. I would cry in the shower about work, i ended up having a miscarriage (before I started drinking), and I got very worried about my boyfriend driving especially merging on the highway. Next thing I knowBAM I thought I was having a heart attack every day and my anxiety went through the roof. (Historymy moms dad died of a heart attack and I spent my whole childhood hearing about how likely it was my mom would die of a heart attack and so would I for some reason) . Every time Id go into a store I thought Id pass out, (masks did not help), or get violently ill. I couldnt walk down the street from my housebefore Id go on hour long walks wherever daily couldnt focus on anything except my body responses to anxiety. Id cry nightly, my shoulder always hurt. I couldnt eat things I loved without thinking Id have a heart attack. During this time I had to move out of my apartment to a new state, be in a wedding, and buy a house in a whole other state than the one I moved to. I had this happen to me once back in college out of the bluesomeone said I could be allergic to pineapple because it made my tongue sore (because thats what pineapple does) and AM I spent weeks afraid Id die of an allergic reaction and have terrible panic attacks until they just disappeared. Between that one and the one above was a 6 year gap. Im still not the same person an entire year later but the thing that worries me is my stress at work has gone back up. Now Im drinking more, went from 0 drinks since my panic attack to 2-3 on the weekends, and Im VERY worried about my boyfriend driving around sharp corners and stuff like that. Same but different. No heart attack fears but instead I think Im going to die crashing into the side barrier on the road and being tossed through the windshield because my boyfriend is going 15 over the limit. Im working out daily, I mediate, I do yoga, I get sunshine, I drink water, I eat healthy but I cannot shake this. I got a check up at the Des and Im super healthy. I just dont know what to do. I want to be my old self again. ",

    "text": "Hey guys,. I have never really had the chance to talk about my issues to anybody and what I have been going through as I have always kept everything inside myself but I really want this to get out of this misery and jail within my mind. I am a 20-year-old male individual who came to the U. S from another country to study engineering. Before I came to the U. S I was moved and homeschooled for the final two years of high school (junior, senior) in a different city because my parents did not want me to attend regular school anymore as they believed I would not study hard enough and ruin my grades. It really isolated me from normal life and I started losing myself slowly and was spending a majority of my life within my room, alone. As the time for the final examination for high school came I performed the poorest I ever did in my life I failed all the subjects but somehow all the scores were curved in a way that I passed all the exams by the margin. That broke me that day and made me realize the agony I brought to my family after all the efforts. Although I was not a bad student I was able to manage 1350 in the SAT are they were really easy to give and I used to go to AT tutor classes twice a week which I really used to look up to, it was like my only classroom experience with other students and I used to learn a lot and feel good during that time. Outside of class, I still was alone and isolated in my room most days and was never in touch with those people as they would always be engaged in school activities or friend activities and I was normally not allowed to be outside at all. When I finally got my acceptance from a university here for my field of study everyone was really happy and I thought I had finally gotten my chance to redeem myself in life and my father wanted to finance my higher education. My father also used to live in the U. S (my parents got separated when I was 9 and my mother was the only parent who was physically there with me till I turned 18). I came to the U. S when I was 18 and finally got to see my father after that long time he had already married another woman and was living a new life about which I have always been supportive. Although I was not a bad student I was able to manage 1350 in the SAT are they were really easy to give and I used to go to AT tutor classes twice a week which I used to look up to, it was like my only classroom experience with other students and I used to learn a lot and feel good during that time. I told him a lot about how it interrupts my studies and that I can not do it while having a different field of interest. He started threatening my financial aspect and as I couldn't afford that I slowly started spending a lot of time helping him with all his work and troubles. Then came COVID, I was stuck at his home for an unknown period and he had me as his assistant and would even interrupt me from taking exams online. I started failing all my subjects with all F's and it became so worse that I could not even look at my student portal without having panic attacks. I repeated courses and failed again. I am a junior right now and all my courses are still freshmen repeats. Last Fall something devastating happened, my father led guilty for a white-collar crime he had committed and he was sentenced for about a year. When I heard of it I came back to his place, decided to take a semester off, and have been trying to maintain things as I have lost all hope to achieve my college degree, I had no friends in college nor a social network and I was too scared to go back to campus as when I did last time( ALL) I kept myself so isolated and was so extremely depressed I got all F's all over again because I simply couldn't get a single thing done. Now coming back to what I said in the beginning, I never really told anyone what I am going through as my family has no idea I have failed my courses over and over again, they don't know I have taken a semester off ( I lied to them about doing the current semester online from my father's place), they don't know I have been suicidal in the past and have these severe mental issues. I don't know how long it will go on but clearly, I will not be able to keep all this from my family for much longer and I do not intend to anymore I really hope some of you could reach out to me and advise me to with something as my mind stopped working months ago. P. S. I wake up each day almost having no memory of the previous day and as soon as I get up the reality crawl up to my thoughts and drains the soul out of me within the first few minutes. I have had events where I have been sleep paralyzed, women up after a 16-hour sleep, and still feeling drowsy and tired. Basically, I am living a life where when my eyes are closed is the one I look forward to each day. ",

    "text": "Hello, first time here. I am a 21- year old male living in the Up. I'd like to begin by saying that there is something incredibly wrong with me, and I don't quite know what is is. For most of my adolescence years, I was a very lonely kid. I did have friends in Highschool and I did talk to people, but I did not consider them friends because they would rarely invite me out hangout after school. I was always the one singled out in the group. They made plans in front of me all the time. This has made me sad till this day because why was I shun out? Why did they have to forget me? We all got along in school but when it came to outside of it, nothing. I think this affected me greatly because it started to make my brain think that I have to be a lone wolf. It made me think, Well, if they wanna leave my life, that's okay, I'll do it ALL myself. MYSELF. I feel like my brain has conditioned me to eventually become alone. Now, I also have been in multiple relationships. They have all ended in heartbreak, including my most recent relationship, which was with a girl who did everything right. All my other relationships did not have the love she showed me. However, we broke up for multiple reasons on my part. Now, this is where it gets interesting and where the problem lies. For some reason, these relationships always end in heartbreak one way or another. I thought if I'd find a good girl, things would change but obviously that was not the case. The weirdest thing about this tho is that I have cried at least once in all of these relationships. it is usually because of miscommunications or something else, but when I cry, I cry loud. I start crying hard and shouting while driving in the car. Now, as weird as this sounds, I feel like my brain feels comfort after these disastrous events that make me cry. it's as if my brain subconsciously set me up just to get me cry afterwards and feel all the chemicals in my brain. I realized I might be addicted to those chemicals now. Another thing I struggle is loving myself I believe. This is because I am always having terrible meltdown due to the fact that I do terrible things that would in a way consider me a bad person. But here's the thing, I am the most open minded, loving, kid, empathetic human I know. At times, I show love, happiness, and overall a differently personality. I become a better person this was especially with my last relationship because like I said, this was a good girl who always tried to help me. Now. I said we broke up for multiple reasons because of me. Well, I never got the chance to really tell her why we broke up and in fact I still don't know why I broke up with her I thought it was because I lost feelings naturally, but now I'm not so sure because I have realized that maybe I broke up with her because my good subconscious side told me that I need to grow and become mature. That I am not ready for a relationship. That I need to leave now. now I'd be lying if this was the complete truth, but I also broke up wit her because I did feel like I lost some feelings for her and I was not ready to because I am not. I don't know if that's because I just didn't feel the spark with my ex anymore or because I wanted to screw around. I won't lie, I watch porn a lot and get tempted to check out girls and stuff and with media online, girls are everywhere. I am pretty sure I am a sex addict because I never think about the consequences . In the moment, this lust feels great but after weeks, I become sad because I know this is just me being addicted. Also smoke weed everyday now. and addicted to that too. S. now I am trying to fight the porn addiction, the sex addiction, the bad side of me vs my good side. I feel like I'm two people and the bad side is winning by a lot so far. Maybe I have BD with something on the side haha. I think the addiction to heartbreak comes from a self defense mechanism from when I was younger. somehow, my brain was taught to think of the worst case scenario, and take measures to prevent that and basically make everything perfect. but when it doesn't work, I cry because of the pain and yet feel sort of a rush of emotions together which makes me cry harder and yet again,revived a larger rush of excitement/relief/. what do u guys think.

    "text": "Hi,. I'm a 40 year old male with a wife and 2 daughters. My house is paid off, we both drive new vehicles and my kids are happy and healthy. Why do I constantly feel lost and like the world is falling apart? . Some back story:. Over the last year my life has changed drastically. On my 40th birthday I found out my wife was having an emotional affair. This hit me hard and the amount of anger I felt was nearly overwhelming. I would say I have moved past it, but that was almost a year ago. I fear everytime she texts someone it is happening again. I don't think it is, but in the back of my mind I'm reviving all the pain that this caused me. I played in a band and because I got a new job I had to give up one of the things that brought me the most joy, playing music live for an audience. I've been on tour, I've played to thousands and the breakup of this small town cover band hit me hard at a time when I was already having some other mental health issues. I suffer from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The patches get worse with stress, which is currently mixed out. When they get worse it is a compound effect. I get more stressed when they get bad which in turn makes it worse. My job is honestly the least problematic thing in my life, which is funny because I manage one of the most hectic and unknown phases of the whole operation, which also comes with the biggest divas in the company. To me, this is easy. Structure is easy to me. I've always had a fear of the unknown. I don't like to try new things or visit new places because I can't predict the outcome. It will drive me insane with the thought of not knowing what will happen. I have a bad habit of always imagining the worst case scenarios in my head. I can visualize it and it is never pretty. Example: if I see my kid playing near the road I can see them being hit by a car or being taken by some sick. Therefore I never let them out of my sight (they are 13 and 10). It makes them feel crappy with an overprotective parent on them all the time. Finally I have been having dreams about another woman. It is frightening to me to think I could have a crush on someone other than my wife, but I can also understand how much it hurt me to have her do what she did to me. I would never pursue it in real life, I don't think, but of course it intuiges me. She is also married so it would be just a mess for everyone. I have no idea if she would even be interested in me. She is flirts, but that could just be me over analyzing everything. I'm just seeking some advice. Sorry it's a long read. I would TLDR but I wouldn't know how to summarize this story. Thanks! ",

Why are there no options for young people who work hard but still cannot make ends meet? Why are there no options for single young people? Students? Not everyone has friends, not everyone is dating or has a boyfriend or girlfriend they can live with. It is honestly so unfair to us single, young, students that are working so hard every single day. This is the biggest slap in the face. I am trying. I am putting money aside, and it still isnt enough. Affordable housing options shouldnt just be for seniors Young people need help as well and its ridiculous and unfair. Are us young people supposed to be homeless and destitute because all of the affordable housing is unavailable to us? I am so incredibly upset by this I am working so hard and none of it matters because all I can afford to do is stay in this house and be mistreated daily The worst part is this parent could drain me of all my finances and leave me homeless and stranded, but since they would qualify for affordable senior living here soon, they be perfectly fine, and Id have nothing. I am so upset right now I am literally nauseated. Im trying so hard and it doesnt even matter. ",

    "text": "I'm definitely not really expecting any responses, I just don't have anywhere I can get this out. I have so much privilege. I have no fucking right to not be okay. I see a goddam therapist, how fucking privileged could I be? How supremely lucky could I be in this day in age to be able to get into a therapist on a fortnightly basis? I have no fucking traumatic life events. I'm just a 25 y/o privileged Australian white cisgender woman with middle class parents and a full-time job that gets me out of my head for 45 hours a week. Anyway. Fuck I don't know. I just don't have anywhere I share this - mostly because therapy isn't for another week. I have friends I can talk to, who are incredible people - again, I'm so lucky to have the friends I have. Incredibly lucky, to be honest. I think I'm just good at putting on a lil facade so they still like me even though I'm just no fucking good. And this is so fucking embarrassing, because the topic is . I hoped I had ADHD. My friend 29F was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, and I was talking to her about how my housemates doctor suggested she might have ADHD, and how I was surprised because she's not what I considered To me she seems focused, motivated, very academic, on top of everything, and really good at putting aside leisure for getting work done first (everything I absolutely am not). I know she has some mental health issues, but she seems to manage them really well. I made a joke about how if someone like that could potentially have ADHD then by god I've gotta have it. (Note: I am very aware I was not in the session with my housemate and her doctor, and she very well could be masking a lot of symptoms! No intention to undermine her experience at all. I love her dearly, she's a very good friend. ) . My 29F friend was like. I mean, you definitely have ADHD. You have all the symptoms I have. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to explore and so I did, and I came to the conclusion that shit, I might? Have ADHD? . Right? Watching too much Tiktok, much? . But it was in my head. I am really forgetful. I am really bad at focusing on tasks. I get distracted VERY easily (I used to regularly leave the stove on until I got on a rigorous habit of checking every individual knob all the time, even when I'm not cooking). I can't do anything academic until the last minute and then I'll spend 6-12 hours doing nothing but the thing and get a good grade so no one is the wiser, except the tutor who sees me chugging half a litre of energy drink the next day in class, because I probably haven't slept a wink. Unless there is a task I urgently need to do, I'll do absolutely nothing at home, or I'll priorities stupid things like playing video games, or thinking about playing video games but actually just laying in bed stuck on Instagram or something until it's too late for videogames and I realise I didn't wash my work uniform so I have to do that immediately and force myself awake until it finishes. So I saw a psychologist. She's great, a very good psychologist who has taken my bullshit in stride and is very attentive. As well as unpacking my previous history of risk taking and inserting myself into dangerous situations, we started exploring ADHD. She was leaning towards ADHD after my first round of tests, but after talking to my Mum and doing some additional testing, she told me she didn't think I had ADHD, and rather that I may have a learning disorder (but she wasn't sure yet if my results were statistically significant). I'll get the report on Wednesday and find out. My mum has since done some research into ADHD, and she does feel that my Dad and I do have it, and she was going to email my psychologist some additional info, but she's left it too late (my fault, I didn't think to tell her when the report was being finalised), so I've told her not to worry about it. Anyway. That's the backstory. It's a lot of text but it's just my overly wordy way of saying waaah, privileged white woman wanted to be neurodivergent so she wasn't just a lazy . But I'm not neurodivergent. And yes, if I have a learning disorder, that is still valuable information (and there were some significant deficits in my testing that support the learning disorder theory) - and not shameful or bad at all. But if I do have a learning disorder, that isn't treatable. That's not fixable, and frankly does not account for the characteristics in myself that I fucking hate. ADHD might have, and ADHD is treatable. But I don't have that. So I'm just. A lazy fuck. The horrible little voice in my head that's been telling me that for most of my life was right. I had hoped this testing might have proved it wrong, but it proved the voice right. And I fucking hate it. I fucking hate myself. I fucking hate that I thought there might have been an excuse for this behaviour, but it's just laziness and privilege that has made me like this, and maybe I should just work harder at being a better human but it feels completely impossible. I can't be more. I don't have a little voice in my brain that says maybe it's time to do your I have tucker let's become one with the floor and maybe the pile of laundry will fucking suffocate you and then you don't have to do . I don't know. I think I on some level am blaming my mum for not contacting my psych sooner, but I know it's my fault for not giving her the details. And really, I should trust my psychologist's skills of assessment. It's not like this is her first rodeo. I just don't want to accept that i'm just awful and lazy and unlovable, but I am. Over into testing doesnt change that. It just proves that the only reason I've come this far is my profound privilege. If you made it this far, holy crap, you're pretty incredible. I wanted to have ADHD because it's trendy but I probably don't have ADHD, I'm just a lazy privileged fuck which is /not/ trendy. ",

    "text": ". Hi everyone,. For three months i've been stuck at home with burnout. I'm a student who is doing his master's degree, I work three days a week on the side as a not sure what the English word is) at a group where people with problematic psychiatric problems live. I'm used to aggression, yelling, lots of chaos, etc. However one day I started experiencing pain attacks, felt like I was having a heart attack, sleeplessness, the usual burn-out symptoms. My general practitioner gave me anti-anxiety mens as I started experiencing daily panic attacks after hardly sleeping for weeks on end. and simply told me to take it easy. I'm slowly but surely able to do some things again like hanging out with friends, take a walk of over 30 minutes without my legs giving up, and making a bit of music. However, the panic attacks and the stress are still there daily. These things are manageable and I thought I was doing decent. However lately I've been waking up at night or very early in the morning in the middle of a panic attack. I cannot keep it under control as I don't feel it coming. I simply wake up in the middle of a panic attack and these tend to stay for longer than 30 minutes to an hour. I feel like something is wrong in my body during these attacks and that my body doesn't feel like it's my own. During these moments I wake up my roommate or call my sister awake who talk me through it while I take my anxiety medications. But the problem with this is that these medications are supposed to be an exception when I cannot sleep entirely or cannot keep my panic attacks under control. as they are addictive. Does anyone have experience with these situations? and if so, does anyone have some tips or advice for me? My general practitioner simply tells me to take it easy and is refusing to send me to a psychologist. I've started at a physiotherapist to help me with my physical problems and stress but I am starting to feel scared of falling asleep because I keep waking up with the feeling that I'm dying and I am not sure what to do about it.

Since 2011, she's been in and out of hospitals after numerous suicide attempts through prescription medication overdose. She's received electroconvulsive therapy, has had what feels countless medication changes, but nothing ever seems to stick. She moved in with me in 2019 after I (foolishly) agreed to it, and things were stable for about two years. Over the past year, though, she's overdose three times (most recently 1. 5 weeks ago), all of which I was the one who had to call an ambulance on her behalf. What's typically happened is that after the initial recovery period (anywhere from a couple of days to a week), she's committed for maybe a few weeks at most, and then she's released back to me. She's fine for a while, but it's clear when she's about to take a downturn and overdose again. I don't know how to escape the situation, because she doesn't really have anyone who would be willing to take her on. At the rate she's going, I can't see her being able to keep her full time job, which would mean her current insurance wouldn't cover her, and she'd be less likely to receive the care she needs. I'm just scared to have her on my hands forever and essentially have to sacrifice my own life in the process. She's become my burden, and it's not a burden I want or deserve to have.

Is there anything I can do to support her more? I've tried being as supportive as possible and I've made it clear that she can talk to me whenever with no judgement. I want to do more than just say everything is going to eventually be ok and to not be so hard on yourself when you're having a bad day because I know first hand that's a frustrating and unhelpful thing to be told sometimes but other than that and just listening I'm a bit lost on what to do. I just feel unhelpful. Would anyone be able to share ways in which I could help or do more? I know it's such a deeply personal struggle but I hate watching my friend go through this. I know I can't make everything better but I want to do my best to help. ",

    "text": "I have been in a abusive relationship before, and onesided friendships (that I didnt realize they were onesided until betrayal. ). Usually those people are not very self-aware deep down, and that can often make them toxic. Emotions or acts of cruelty or heartlessness can affect me deeply after those past events. I am dating a person, (long distance at the moment) very sweet and kind deep down and they are trying their best. I trust them, and they love me a lot. But sometimes when I need support, they are more quiet and less active in supporting me. (Usually processing thoughts and stuff, but they only act or are emotionally brighter when I am already better later. ). For your information, this isnt dating advice but this is needed for context for this mental state. This deafening silence in their texts or Voicechat, or sometimes even their own lack of self-awareness, can put me into a spiral of paranoia and eventually increasing emotional panic, when Im starting to see patterns that relate to people in my past. Often if theres too much silence when theyre around, I start to think of all the worst-case scenarios in my head at a very fast pace. And I start seeing this person as more evil than they are, or scared of in what way I could lose them in the future because of them showing a few signs that point toward people who hurt and betrayed me in the past. (Heartless things they do sometimes, it feels like they do accidentally and dont realize it, but just because they lose touch with their heart and feelings. ). The thing is, they are a nice person deep down But I cant help but feel scared that they arent. And the more they remain silent, the more I think of bad possible scenarios of how they could hurt or betray me later, and I panic. What should I do to get out of this? . Im a very calm and wise, calculated person 99% of the time in my life. But in relationships like this, seeing behaviors or cycles that remind me of my past, make me feel so scared and panicky. Especially if the other person cant help reassure me just yet. But rationally I know that this could be a lot better if I could take control of my mind a lot more during such times and not let it spiral I know it looks more catastrophic to me than it really probably is, and Im self-aware enough to understand this despite my trauma. So what do you think should I do to stop my brain for entering this loop, and bring myself back to a more rational and collected state? ",

Around the same time my twin brother became very alone and depressed. All this being my dad working his ass off to pay the bills. So I also have a gf (18) we are in a long distance relationship (450km I think 220miles) we have been dating for 2 years. But the last 2-3 months when my mental health has been declining she is no longer respectful of me in any way. I feel she is extremely disrespectful by texting a lot of guys (may 10-20) and telling me she need someone to talk to. I pretend I accept it, but it is killing me inside. We both got our issues and she went out the weekend with some classmates whom I never got to meet or know. I decided to surprise her by driving 4. 5 hours to pick her up at one of her girlfriends apartments without her knowing. But when I see her walking out the door with some other guy it broke my heart. She told me that it was the boyfriend of the girl living there. Im not sure I buy that story. I drove her home. Stayed with her for about an hour. When she left for work I drove 4. 5 hours home. She never seemed happy with me showing unannounced. I tried calling and texting her when I got home. She tested back she wants to be alone for a bit. Me as an over thinker is assuming the worst. Her having an affair and panicking seeing me. (The car ride to her place was abt 25 minutes. She didnt say a word and was shaking a little while looking down on her phone). Yes I have some trust issues. There has been a lot of lying. And her talking to her ex. Even when telling me she didnt. (I had proof and she continued to lie) . Our arguments are becoming a more frequent thing and her personally attacking me with me not trusting her. Even when I start to do again something happens. This is hurting me. Im not saying my record is clean. But I always stayed loyal and did anything to hurt her. Im scared of being alone. The feel of emptiness. Not being loved. It scares the living sht out of me. But this is hurting me. I need help. Im not expecting and replies. Just a upvote will make me feel heard. Thank you. ",

We tried group homes, therapists, and mens, but he doesn't cooperate with anyone or want to take his mens. He has a habit of developing paranoia in places he lives in. At our old home, he thought the neighbors were watching him, so he put blankets over the windows(even though they were curtains covering the windows). He didn't have a good relationship with our sister and thought she was spying on him, so he broke her laptop. At the group home, he thought they were spying on him through his phone. Now, at our current home, he thinks the neighbors are spying on his phone and computer. He doesn't use his devices anymore instead he has a habit of restarting his phone and computer every minute until he goes to bed. He thinks by doing that, whatever spyware they have will be deleted. But, then states the neighbors will install it again in a few seconds. Whenever there's a phone nearby, he won't talk until we go into a room with no phones present. We have a smart fridge that has a screen which is basically a smartphone. He would constantly restart it and would wake up in the middle of the night to restart it again. He would speak near the fridge beating the neighbors and calling them names, thinking they can hear him through the fridge. Sometimes at night, he would stand by the door and poke his head outside and look repeating this several times. We had to turn off the screen because he was becoming more delusional and rate. Now he doesn't talk to himself or stand by the door anymore now that it's off. In addition, he now has a problem with the cars keeping when they lock or start it. He says they been it whenever he moves or when he is eating. He states they do that so they can bait him to look out the window, so they can take a picture of him and take it to the police. He had paid for an antivirus program to find if they are any viruses on his Px. No viruses were found. He says that the program is wrong and doesn't work. He calls anyone who doesn't believe him and they don't believe in the . We tried just about everything, but he doesn't cooperate with anyone.

Right now, I want to get serious about finding help. I am not getting any younger. I have private insurance through my spouse's employer. I would say its an average plan. However I'm finding that most therapists that offer DB around me do not take insurance been through the Psychology today ). (There is one psych hospital near me that offers a DB program but I don't want to do deal with that because of the way they treated me and family in the past and also because they are big proponents of EC therapy and have been known to suggest if not compel people with hard to treat cases of mental illness to get it. I'm slipping into a bit of a rage right now just thinking about it). So I understand that for proper DB - you really need skills therapy followed by or in conjunction with individual therapy. Because I can't find any qualified providers that do DB with insurance -- it seems like private pay could easily be or more. While I have the ability to use a credit card, using debt in my life has been as addictive as using drugs for someone else. I could really go into a debt spiral. I am not convinced that DB therapy will improve my life and income so much that I would be able to pay the debt back. I would appreciate some suggestions you may have. Are there online programs?

I'm currently 68kg(150lbs), They said that I was a happy and a pretty toddler (At 3 years old I was scouted at the mall by a modeling agent, which my mom rejected. ) My mom left me at 4 years old because she had to work abroad. My dad basically doesn't live with us anymore due to work. He only comes home 1-2 times a month. I have two older brothers(22 24). I had to live with my grandparents. As early as 7 years old I was constantly body shared by my grandma's church friends, my aunts and uncles, cousins, classmates, brothers, even by my grandparents. I started starving myself as early as 7 years old, even tried extreme work outs to the point of not being able to walk. But everytime I would do this, it becomes worse. This continued until now. No one really cared for me, I had to learn proper hygiene by myself, I developed body odor at 8yrs. old,, which I was bullied more because of it. I only got to see my mom after 7 years, which was first hug I felt in 7 years, I almost cried but held it until I was alone. I found out my dad is cheating on my mom ever since. Since then, I was always mad for no reason, even started fights with my parents and brothers. Fast forward a bit my mom left again. I started over-eating, not practicing personal hygiene, and isolated myself. At 12 years old, I started cutting myself, to the point where both my wrists are red. My teacher saw it and laughed at me, and said I was just seeking for attention. I tried to kill myself the week after that incident by overdosing. Obviously, I failed. I woke up the next morning and went to school like nothing happened. ( I had my own bedroom eversince I was 4) My parents never knew this attempt. And they will never know. At 14 I tried to kill myself once more, again I failed. But this time, one of my cousins knew so he told my mom, and my mom who had a great career overseas, threw it all because of me. With her career gone, and her jobless, we started getting poor, to the point of she can't even give me lunch for school. Which was okay since I thought it would be a good way to lose weight. At 16, my dad and I had a major fight, he was so frustrated he said that I should've been aborted. (My dad's mistresses virtually attacks me bc apparently, I was the reason why my mom and dad couldn't get a divorce). I just snapped and I tried to kms again, (still failed. ) She decided to get me a psychiatrist, but we couldn't continue anymore bc the consultation and medication was so expensive. My periods were also irregular (continuous 3-month period) so my mom decided to get me a check-up. Turns out I have COS (polycystic ovary syndrome) which prevents me from losing weight. I could've gone into more detail but it is already too long. I'm now 18, and I'm trying my best to live. ",

Gained weight trying her ideas, not ideal for someone already in the upper 200s. I left the practice because she didn't listen to me saying I wasn't agreeing with her ideas. Psychiatrist 1 - Tried some fairly standard frontline mens, didn't get success. He moved states. Regular Therapist 2 - Also an eating disorder specialist, but half our time was again spent on discussing my wife. Brought my wife in for a solo appointment, wife really didn't like her. Eventually I moved states, so dropped her. Psychiatrist 2 - Hesitant to change anything from psych 1 who handed me off to her, saw her for a couple months before I moved states. Regular Therapist 3 - Had for the second longest time, had longest practice history and best credentials. By the end, was visibly saddened at not being able to help, but told me I was sad and didn't have a better idea of how to help. Referred me to a couples therapist and a gender identity therapist (his best idea). Eventually told me I should likely look for someone else. Psychiatrist 3 - Tried another set of frontline approaches. Ran out of ideas, referred me to another psychiatrist, with the idea of maybe trying esketamine. (Died a couple months later of covid). Psychiatrist 4 - Tried some more novel approaches based on running a NA panel. Was thinking of trying esketamine, but they stopped adding new patients for that for a bit, because covid, since it's in person. Eventually, however, had to hide my gender identity from her as she was super conservative, which I hadn't realized at the start. Couples Therapist 1 - Generally liked her, felt things were improving in some ways here. Unfortunately had only 3 days a week where she saw patients, and my wife got a job that made seeing her not possible. Gender Identity Therapist - Been super great. If it weren't for him, might have given up on therapy entirely with my lackluster results. Still seeing. Psychiatrist 5 - Mostly has been slooowly taking me off everything psychiatrist 4 put me on, hadn't really had any novel ideas, kinda disappointed. Did suggest I try MS. Still seeing. MS - Had a rough go of it. Had to wake up early for a few months, couldn't use their preferred machine due to jaw pain with teeth clinching activated by the MS. Immediately began having regular nightmares and waking in the middle of the night, they tried adjusting the protocol (making the sessions even longer), but to no effect. Felt they weren't particularly listening and just collecting a big insurance payout for little work. Couples Therapist 2 - Been also really great, but we've gotten to a point where we're past some points of tension and others are more unchangeable, so there's not much to talk about, so we've put it on pause for a little bit. Still content with the therapist and things are pretty good with my wife. Regular Therapist 4 - Seemed waaaay too handholdy - read this and we'll me: reads 4 chairs in a week I read the first 4 let me spend our time reading verbatim from it and waking you through simple examples that you already filled in in your Then, she recommended homeopathic treatments. I said, no, don't suggest that again, I don't give any scientific backing in it. 3 weeks later, she suggests it again. I peace out. Regular Therapist 5 - After the second session, feels she needs to hand me to someone with more eating experience (in eating disorders, I presume? ). Regular Therapist 6 - Seems alright, but never sticks to any one method. Says she's a big DB person, but we do that for 2 weeks before she seems to toss it out. After 8 -ish months, says she doesn't think she's qualified to help me with eating disorders (which I thought was why I was handed off to her? ) So now she's going to send me elsewhere. So 9 total therapists, 5 psychiatrists and MS across 3 states and only a handful have been effective at all. I don't want to keep spending weeks and weeks retelling my history again and again and the screening I've done seems inadequate when I run into quack or people not actually specializing in my issues despite trying to check on that, but what do I do when there's a limited pool that take insurance and have openings?

I have a girlfriend who loves me dearly and we have been together nearly 5 years, and we share two dogs and two cats we are obsessed with. I am also seeing a newer lady I met in January who I am quickly falling for, and her and my girlfriend get along incredibly well. (We are not poly, these two relationships are separate but we all get along). I have good, solid friends. I am involved in two music projects. I am super active, working out 4x a week with moderately heavy lifting and healthy eating. I make decent money, enough to pay bills while Im in school to be a nurse. I do smoke a lot of weed. I am on 50mg Zoloft per day for anxiety, . I take adderal every now and then, maybe a Xamax on a plane ride but nothing crazy. My drug binge days are over (unless its a an on a plane lol god I love that). All of this, yet all I think about all day is wishing I had a doctor like Michael Jackson had to anesthetize me to sleep, so I dont have to feel anything. Lately, all I keep thinking about is buying some fentanyl and taking as big a dose as I can find and drift off. I feel like no matter how much good I do, no matter how good things are, importer syndrome makes me feel like I dont deserve any of it. I feel like a fraud. I feel like everyone is just going to quit on me at any given moment, and I try very hard day to day to not self sabotage. Its like, . because I was so sucked up in the past emotionally, ever since I dug myself out of the hole and made this beautiful life for myself over the past 8-9 years since my lowest point, I really wake up every day grateful and just like wow I love life, but theres always this thing in the back of my mind telling me its all about to be taken away. I dont wanna die really, I rather love life th going outside on walks even just shit like that brings me tons of joy. Id. Anyone else feel this way no matter how good things are going? Im scared because I dont want to end up being depressed in a rut one night and make a mistake I cant take back. I dont want to die. I just dont know what to do with life sometimes. ",

Most of the people here still seem to easily be able to differentiate fantasy from reality, but I feel like I I can literally never turn it off, I constantly feel like I'm being watched by fictional characters, and I feel like they can hear all of my thoughts. I know that it's not real, but I can't fully convince myself that I'm actually in reality. I have CD, but none of the things that work for my normal intrusive thoughts work for this because it feels very different. I experience occasional episodes of psychosis and that isn't this either (though it's closer than the intrusive thoughts). I know it's extreme dissociation, but it's such a weird manifestation of it that I really just don't understand. I feel like I've been so cut off from reality for so long that it's impossible to go back, even just for a second. It started as just daydreaming constantly and progressed into whatever this is. Literally none of the mental health professionals I've talked to have understood. I don't think any of them ever will because I have never seen anyone who experiences the same thing I do with all of this. It is such a fundamental part of my identity that I truly don't think it'll ever go away. I feel alone because I am alone. Everyone just tells me to seek professional help, and I understand why, but I literally have been and nothing has helped because no one understands it. They either don't take me seriously, or just find it interesting but don't really know what to do about it because they've never seen someone experience this before. ",

    "text": "So yeah, i'm here with a problem that I wonder if anyone is also going through it too? I suffered from major depression and anxiety disorder since 4 years ago. Like other people with this disease, I was also unable to meet people or go outside for a while back then, but I slowly learned to adapt to go back to work after a few years. And then I realized that I had a strange problem that was very confusing. I intentionally avoided looking people in the face. And as a result, I couldn't remember the faces or names of my teammates. I realized it only when i noticed why i cant remember everyone's names and faces even though we worked together for 6 months. I know I'm a goldfish brain but am I really that forgetful? So the next day I was planning to go and recognize everyone's faces, but that strange thing happened. I realize I can't look at their faces, all I remember at the end of the day is the color of their clothes, from the neck down. I've certainly tried to see a few people's faces, but their faces are so blurry in my mind and most of the time I just look down when I'm communicating with them. There was a strong sense of resistance that prevented me from looking at their faces? And i'm like Why i It's weird right? This is really annoying when we work together, when handing over the work I don't know who to look for, all the people in that room are strange to me. (P/s: Come to think of it, I seem to remember some faces at the time but it quickly faded away ). ",

    "text": "I've been thinking about this a lot recently. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. I am 18 years old, in college, have friends, a good family, am smart, and an all around good life. However, just recently, I think I just realized I have depression. The other night while high, I was looking in the mirror and thinking about what my life looks like from another persons perspective. I think I just realized that I have been subconsciously lying to myself about having depression. I've never ever really felt sad at all which is the one main reason I think I never realized what I've been going through. I have recently been sleeping terribly, had fatigue. just having this general haze over me. One huge red flag is the dark spots under my eyes. Being high I could see them really clearly, but when I'm sober its almost like they're a part of my face. I feel pretty good about my life for as long as I can remember but I think it's only because I know I should be content and therefore I am. I don't myself to be happy and excited about things but I my emotions just don't really feel natural. Thinking about it now I think I've been unaware of feeling emotionless. I thought I'm feeling just what everybody else does. The thing is I can't really remember not being like this so I have come to accept it as being normal. I'm wondering if other people are experiencing the same thing so I can know if this is normal or not. Like I genuinely can't even remember the last time I was really sad about something. Like I don't get sad, I only am happy all the time but it's this artificial happy I'm talking about. I guess I just haven't been feeling emotions recently. The last time I actually remember being sad was some girl problems I had at one point this past summer. My mom has taken me to therapy about 3 years ago as this was around when my dad moved out. My dad has been struggling with alcoholism for a while and my mom thought it was of best interest if he would move out. My dad still comes to the house every day to help my younger siblings with school, sports, etc. My parents are on pretty good terms with each other and I don't think this was a catalyst for anything because I don't remember my life changing at all after this change. My dad does have a long line of depression and anxiety on his side of the family. I never really thought this effected me because I never knew what depression actually was like. Can non-depressed people understand depression? I can't believe I've thought this was normal. Later today I'm going to call my mom to tell her about what I've been thinking about. Also, I plan on talking to a therapist or doctor sometime in the near future. I think I just realized I've been depressed for the past 2+ years but I didn't know what it was. ",

Basically the pressure to find the job or the career where he would be happy and make a good living for his family was just too overwhelming. He was a carpenter by trade but left due to the physical impact on his body. I went back to school and am employed/supporting the family. I have ZERO problems with him being unemployed. I dont hold to gender roles and patriarchal value system. I just want him to feel validated and fulfilled. I need him to be happy and healthy. Yes constantly aware of all the things he needs/should be doing. But has intense motivation issues. He had add along with bouts of anxiety and depression. He wants to build a shop and make things he likes. But we dont have the funds to remodel the garage into a safe workshop so he justgave up. He bought all these tools and started clearing things out but realized he couldnt practically refinish the flooring and re-wire the electrical lines without spending more money or hiring someone. So he justpacked it all up and is returning the tools. He says theres no point of pouring money into this when hes never going to actually make anything out there. That it will just be a big drain. He says hes never completed anything and hes incapable of following through with projects. Basically is self-worth is in the gutter. Not to mention the decades spent in a high-demand religion that established shame cycles. (Were reconstructing. ) He feels doomed to failure even before he begins and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. Some of it is the fact that we dont have the investment money to even begin starting some of the projects. But hes just really internalized the concept that hes just all talk when it comes to making things/completely projects. Yes extremely intelligent but has never been provided an outlet or get validation for what he can do. Yes always collected hobbies: welding, bladesmithing, woodworking, guitar building, rock hounding, geology, etymology, writing, Fabricating, Car mechanics. Yes never been able to pick just one thing. Yes got a very mechanical mind and can talk shop with high-paid engineers in the industry. I think he needs to see a psychiatrist and therapist to identify whatever past trauma is triggering him and keeping him from obtaining his goals. He thinks hes just a fuck up and its just part of his personality. This man is my everything. Yes funny and bright, caring and supportive. I dont care if he doesnt make money, but he needs something that validated him. He needs to feel valued and productive. (For reference hes also on Testosterone for hormonal imbalance, so he can have intense dips on mood. ) What does it sound like to you? Im looking for reading material. Types of therapy. Diagnosis insight. Anyone who has lived with this before. I just need some perspective. Thanks for reading. This is breaking my heart. ",

I do worry that the urges will get stronger and i will end up sneaking from my mom or something and mess around and get addicted. now ive heard about aniexty pens and i think those might be able to help me out? i dont know much but from what ive heard they arent as bad for you as tapes are. i think if i can get hold of those it may help. are those even worth asking for? should i just tape instead? hell should i just smoke weed instead? i dont know. all i know is the urges are growing and they keep getting more intense and its really starting to become an issue. please give me some advice.

Approximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the Gt tract, where it regulates intestinal movements. Here is a picture of it: _wall. Now what does that mean? The enterochromaffin cells is the inner lining of your stomach. And is part of the mucosa. It is the walls in your stomach where your food travels through. I have Ulcerative colitis which is an inflammation in my stomach. It also get rid of mucosa. So 90% of the serotonin is in your stomach and absorbed, what happens if your stomach is wrecked? No wonder I respond so well on serotonin I most likely have malabsorption. It is well established all ready that you get deficit of vitamins if you have astro problems. But why have they not told us that it can also be neurotransmitter? You ask",

Overall, I've handled life pretty well, but it's been stressful. A few months ago I was talking about a lot of my issues with someone and they suggested that Borderline Personality Disorder might be a label I should look into. I looked into it a bit, and it kind of fit me, I was scared, but I kind of moved on. I forgot about it for quite a few months. Well now I'm starting to believe that I really do likely have BD. I mean all the emotional instability and general anger was already there. But the thing that's making it really hard to deny is that I think I have an F dynamic now (favorite person). I'm almost certain its not just a crush (if there's any element of that involved which there isn't necessarily), and also isn't just gender envy trans). It matches pretty much completely with how people describe their F. I'm so scared that I'll be abandoned by all of my friends, but especially my F. I'm constantly apologizing for pretty much everything, sometimes I can't even figure out what I'm apologizing for.

She had stage 3 breast cancer in 2020 that was treated with chem and radiation, but the doctor thinks it has metastasized to her liver. We'll have more information next week, but I'm falling apart. From what I've read online liver cancer, especially if there are physical symptoms and it has metastasized, has a very poor prognosis. I lost my dad when I was 15 to a drug overdose and don't have any siblings so I feel pretty alone. My grandma and mom's boyfriend live in the same town, but I'm really horrified to think about losing my only immediate family member. I'm 25. I'm currently living with my partner who has thankfully been very supportive but he's dedicated for bipolar and struggling with the side effects which adds extra stress. His boss has been allowing us to live in one of his properties for free for the last year if we pay utilities, but he's selling the property and if it doesn't sell by August he's going to rent it out so that's basically the latest we're allowed to live here. We live in my hometown which is very small and becoming expensive to rent in. We were planning on moving in May, but are obviously no longer doing that with my mom having cancer. I'm in the last semester of an undergraduate program, but failing all of my classes because of what's been going on at home. I don't currently work so it would be difficult to rent a place bc I don't have proof of income. I've been living off of savings/school grants. I quit my job in January to make it easier to be in school full time since we have a free place to live in temporarily, but now I think I'm going to have to withdraw from the current semester and finish school in summer. I've reached out to my professors and two of them have agreed to let me turn in missing work, so I'm considering salvaging those two and withdrawing from the others. I also have health insurance coming up when I turn 26 later this year. Also, please don't judge for finishing school late. Family health issues have taken a huge toll on me. I recently also found out from a genetic test that I have a 40% chance of getting breast cancer in my lifetime. I feel so overwhelmed and don't know what I should be doing right now. I know I'm an adult, but I have always turned to my mom for guidance and feel like I can't do that right now because she's very ill and I don't want to stress her out/exasperate her condition. I have inattentive ADHD (dedicated) which makes all of this so much harder. I'm struggling with making life decisions while my mom is seriously ill.

And it's making me feel guilty for some reason, even if I don't need to and they all told me they're happy for me. I was wondering if there is some sort of survivors guilt like that? Bc there is no reason I could think of why I'd feel bad. ",

    "text": "I don't know where to begin with something like this so thank you for reading. Story as told by my mother. When I was a toddler (around 1. 5yrs) I had a balloon wrapped around my wrist at a carnival. Some punk came up to me, placed the balloon in my face, and popped it. My mother says I streamed until I passed out and that she had to take me to the hospital as a result. I was too young to retain anything outside of the fear response to immediate, loud noise, and being a jump individual. What doesn't bother me is talking about it, or happening to show somewhere and there's balloons present (other people are allowed to enjoy things, I will plug my ears until the fear feeling subsidies or I can leave the immediate area). What does bother me is how it's surfacing with my first she is 10mos and in the phase of screeching randomly. My only and immediate response is to scream back, not out of anger but out of fear. I can't control it, it's like fight or flight happens and since you can't from sound the only way my brain can block out the sudden unexpected noise is aka scream back. She in no way deserves this and I don't want it to be an issue with future children. I want to start taking steps to heal this, but I don't know how. Thank you again, it means a lot. ",

    "text": "I think a lot about myself and who I am, and recently I've come to the realization that I feel the wrong things. With that I mean, not situationally appropriate emotions, like feeling uncomfortable when hanging out with friends, or feeling hurt over something that really isn't that big of a deal. I've been trying to figure out who I am because it feels like my whole life I've been trying to imitate others. I don't know if I liked movies, or games, or anything else because it's like I was always trying to imitate someone else and put just enough personal difference into it that it's not copying. For example, If a friend likes a series and a specific character from that series, I will act like I like the series too, but choose a different character. I never know if I liked any of that in the first place. Also, whenever other people know a lot about a topic because they like it, I immediately feel inadequate, as if I had to know the exact same amount or more, even if that topic never previously interested me at all. And I think that need to imitate others, because otherwise I feel inadequate or fear that they'll leave me, has led to me covering up my true emotions and pretending that I feel those that are more fitting to a situation. This isn't a bad thing per se, but when I feel ashamed of feeling the things I feel even if they aren't bad, just not fitting to the situation, that's not good. The thing is, I don't even know what I'd want more, because I really don't want to feel the ways I do. I feel so guilty and awful for stuff like having a different opinion or probably liking something, or even not liking something, and I don't know what to do about it. I can't go about my life normally or try to express my true emotions because they can be so intense that I'd rather isolate myself completely than have to face them where they bubble up, and if I expressed them it'll alienate others because they can't relate to them. And it also ruins the things that I actually figured out that I probably like for me, because as soon as I'm confronted with someone else's opinion about it I feel angry at myself for not being like them and having their opinion, and it gets worse the more I like something. I really want to get better, I have bad mental health apart from these problems already, but I don't know how I can come to terms with being myself when I am this. What am I doing all this for when at the end the person who I am is still someone who feels the wrong things, who can't enjoy anything like others do?

    "text": "So, this all started when I changed schools. I had been in the same school for the last (almost) 10 years but it only went up to the 9th grade so I eventually had to change schools. I felt very anxious a few days before my first day, nothing out of the ordinary, but eventually I could talk with no problem to anyone in the class. But recently, there have been these two guys in my class that keep making jokes (if you can even call those jokes). Like, you can be talking about something with another person and they'll just intervene and say you have no Stuff like that. But before all this started, I was walking with one of the guys to my bus stop, the guy is kind of a class clown but he seemed cool at the time, so I told him about the relationship I had with my father. My parents are divorced and my dad is currently homeless and a drug addict. He's tried to treat himself a few times but to no avail. So, as I was telling the guy what my relationship with my father was like he constantly tried to change the subject by making jokes (not about what I was talking about though). I stopped since I thought he wasn't comfortable talking about it with me. Some weeks later, we're walking to the bus stop again but there's the other guy with us, and they're making these dad jokes. Stuff along the lines of: look at the sky. Do you see your I didn't take it seriously because it wasn't completely directed at me. After a while I started getting a bit bothered, but not anything to make me lose my cool, and then the guy I told about my father turns to me and says my dad isn't homeless and a drug My heart sank when I heard that. The other guy probably just thought it was another generic joke, but it It really hit me, but I just laughed it off. When I got home, I message the guy, talking calmly about the situation and why I didn't like it when he said stuff like that. He said and that he wouldn't repeat it again. Everything after that was normal. Then about a week later, we're walking to the bus stop after school again and we were talking about gifts our parents got us. And he just turns to me and says: when even was the last time your dad gave you a And I brushed it off, trying to ignore the passive aggressiveness, and I told him about the time my dad gave me a tablet and I broke it because of a video-game. We laughed a bit and continued talking about the same subject. I don't remember perfectly, but we were talking about father's day gifts or something like that, and he just turns to me and says about you give your dad something to sniff just how he likes Me, him and two other guys that were with us went completely silent. Thing is, it didn't look like he said it as a joke, he was dead serious. But I tried ignoring it for the rest of the walk to the bus stop. Then yesterday day where I live), he sent me a text saying father's day, oh yeah, you don't have I snapped, and sent about 4 or 5 messages saying that I was getting tired of those comments and that how it sounded like he wasn't joking anymore but trying to hurt me. I was put off by it the rest of the day. He replied a few hours later with a voice message saying that he didn't know that I got so offended by what he said but that he wasn't lying. I have no idea why, but I feel guilty for having snapped. I know that I'm right and that he shouldn't just throw the fact that my father is not present to my face. But I still feel bad for having snapped. The worst part is that I'm sure he'll say it again and I'm afraid that I'll lose my cool while I'm at school and do something I'll regret. I get very anxious whenever I think about it and it's making me overthink a lot. I would really appreciate any kind of advice on how to deal with this because I've been feeling down and anxious lately and I don't want to feel this way.

On top of this, even when I get a full 8 hours sleep it doesnt feel satisfying and I feel equally tired throughout the day. Mentally, recently my symptoms have gotten so much worse. Instead of just feeling depressed and unmotivated, I get in weird moods where its like im detached/disconnected from the place im in and i feel intensely depressed, like im about to have some sort of mental break. When I get in these moods I feel like I have to be alone, which is difficult because I just moved in with my girlfriend and I hate wanting to be alone all the time when were doing something. On top of these feelings I also suffer from crippling anxiety (eg. panic attacks) as well as recently CD intrusive thoughts patterns. I feel like I can never get better. Ive gotten blood tests done and been told nothing is wrong with me. Been to psychologists but that didnt seem to help.

I'm always cooled up in my room trying to get work done because I have no other option but to meet the deadlines and score well because my parents have invested way too much money in my education and they've mentioned it a lot of time that I owe this degree to them. I'm constantly stressed, I have bad relation with my own body and I have certain level of social anxiety, but I constantly feel like I'm overexaggerating and this is nothing and I'm just making it all up, but somewhere I know I'm not making it all up because this comes up inside me again and again. I want to take a break but I can't and I feel like I'm going to burst at any given moment. My parents were not the best of the parents but they tried to do the best they could I think, and this makes me angry because I feel like I have no one to blame for whatever I went through and it is unfair. It is really painful and I don't know what's happening. I definitely know my mental health is sucked one way or another because I keep getting in the same loop of not meeting people, not eating properly, sleeping longer, not cleaning my room no matter how hard I try to get out of it and I'm just sick of it. I'm sorry but I just needed to vent this out somehow and I needed to get this out. ",

    "text": "Sorry if this post is all over the place but I just have to clear my mind a bit. Im a soon to be 20 year old male doing my a levels or as I googled general qualification for university entry here in Germany which is also one of the only things thats going good in my life. I think about suicide a lot probably for almost a year now but before I keep going I want to make clear I have no real intentions of going through with it. I would never do it just because of my loved ones I would never dare to hurt with this and besides that Im also way too afraid of death. I just think of it as a solution with which I wouldnt have to deal with everything anymore. I have almost no self confidence besides when Im with really close friends and that stems from a lot of things. Almost a year ago I realized some of my teeth are decaying due to a lack of dental hygiene and I know it gets worse the longer I wait but Im just too embarrassed to tell anyone or go to the dentist. Besides that my general hygiene is also lacking a lot basically showering like once every two months when I really cant get around it anymore. As I already mentioned Im almost 20 and Im still a virgin which is pretty much fine by me but I naturally just grave intimacy with girls my age. Not even sex or sexual intimacy but I just want to be held, show my love and receive love which I cant see happening in the next few years. I also feel like I have no discipline be it regarding school and learning or for example sports/working out. I am also redoing the last year of my education as I failed last year and couldnt move on, which I thought didnt really bother me, but I feel it adding at least a bit to all my insecurities as well. All my friends are in university and more grown up than me and I just feel terrible about my position in life and as a human being. I also want to mention I was a victim of bullying for 4 consecutive years in school which I thought I had really overcome and I was proud of myself for that. I had/still have plans of becoming a teacher because I want to be at an elementary school where my bullying started and protect other children from it as an adult but Im at a point in which I dont believe I can achieve that goal. I see myself adapting the victim role in every aspect of my life more and more to the point in which I dont really care what happens to me. I am a person that really grass the consequences of things only when its too late even though I knew It would come to this regarding everything in my life. So I do care and dont want to be for example homeless in the future, I dont want to disappoint my loved ones but its just easier to go down that road. I also want to mention I have been using weed regularly for a couple of years as well and I never really took a real brake from it until now. I plan to at least stop until my final exam is over and hopefully I will be at a point at which I can stop altogether or at least, because I do still enjoy it, only do it once in a while when Im in good company and not excessively alone at home like the years before. For when Im finished with school I have a guaranteed half to full year in which I just have to wait to be accepted at any university if my ga is good enough for that and in this time a want to tackle a lot of things. I want to get a job so I make some money and have something on my resume for the year, I want to get my drivers license, and I want to tackle my teeth problem as it is probably the biggest insecurity I have had Im my life. I really hope I go through with all this but the fact that Im making plans instead of doing something shows me Im only making excuses as to why I cant do all that right now. I know everything can be handled if I just start just do something about it but just starting feels like an impossible task and as of right now Im more comfortable being miserable alone. I dont have the drive to work for anything thats required of me, be it my drivers license, being more fit, or even finishing my school with the grades I could really achieve if I just did a tiny bit of work for it. I ANT To BETTER MYSELF AND ACHIEVE WHAT I NOW I CAN ACHIEVE UT I NEED HELP. I dont expect a lot of people to come to this point of the post but for everyone who reads until here Im already thankful for your time and thoughts. I may not respond but be sure Im going to read all the comments I get here and even when there are none Im somewhat happy I finally let all of this out. Take care everyone Happy_face_or_smiley . ",

When Im not fully stimulated, doing something that I consider to be productive, I get horrible anxiety and depression. So the obvious solution would be to just do something productive. Easy enough, right? Seems like it should be, but for some reason if I start to feel like Im not being productive, it often creates a spiral of negative momentum in which Ill get down on myself and hate myself for not making the most of my time.

I get thoughts like, I cant believe I havent done anything productive today, an entire day of my life gone to waste. Im such a loser. Obviously its hard to find inspiration to do anything when you have thoughts like these. Its like an endless cycle. My work is pretty inconsistent, some weeks Ill work 50 hours, and those weeks Ill feel fine. Other weeks I wont have any work at all, thats when it gets the worst. I feel like Im under constant pressure all day long to find productive activities to do and if I fail I will be punished with awful thoughts.

    "text": "I'm in a relationship with someone who has BD and I love them dearly and I know they love me back just as much. However, they've recently told me that they have a . A (pardon my terrible explanation) is someone who people with BD become obsessed with and this is something that is not chosen by them. They view this person as perfect and have intense feelings/emotions when it comes to them. They seek validation from them for everything and however they're treated by them is how they feel, and this means whether they feel good or bad about themselves. Even as their partner, your impact on them pages in comparison to the favorite person's actions. Their whole world and sense of belonging revolve around this favorite person. My partner has been clear that although these feelings are intense, they aren't love and that they love no one else but me. And I trust them, and the fact that they opened up to me about having a only helps me trust them more. However, it's been such a stressful and emotionally painful thing for me to handle. I've never been an emotionally strong person but I love them so much and even knowing their conditions, I've striped to be there for them and love them. And though things have been rocky especially due to us being in a long distance relationship, we've made things work through all the tough times. However, hearing about this has filled my mind with stress and anxiety and I don't know how to deal with it. There are two main reasons why this has been so hard to deal with. 1) I've always been there to support my partner when they're feeling down. It's very common for my partner to have breakdowns and I've tried my best to comfort them every time. I reassure them the best I can and type my heart out to make them feel better. And though I manage to somewhat make them feel a bit better, it's never much, and it never lasts. Usually the things I say are taken out of context or go in one ear and through the other. This is common due to their mental condition, but it hasn't stopped me from trying to constantly send them love and comfort. And I'm going to sound absolutely selfish and childish and inconsiderate for their condition, but, for their brain to find someone else, who doesn't even see them the way I do and have them put in less effort just to do so much more than I could've ever achieved to help them through their pain, and brighter up their day, even with all the love and tears I put into comforting and sending them love is so heartbreaking to me. And at this point I feel like I'm just victimizing myself or something. I know this is part of the condition and it's genuinely not their fault. It's not something that I can just blame on someone. I just feel so many negative emotions that I don't mean but can't control. I feel jealous and angry and powerless. These aren't feelings that anyone deserves but I still feel these things. It's just so easy to think, what am I doing I even And I know the answers to these questions but I still can't stop myself from asking them. 2) I'm a very jealous person, especially when it comes to my partner. However, despite having had many toxic and controlling thoughts in the past, it's something I've worked on and I don't really have to deal with much now. An example of this is me being very anxious when they would hang around those of the opposite sex. I've overcame thoughts like those by instead trusting my partner and believing in their love for me. However, the thought of them obsessing over someone else absolutely triggers my jealousy and anxiety. I know they love me very much and though this is genuinely the case, their mind and body thinks otherwise, instead obsessing over someone else. It's such a complicated situation. I am a horrible overthinker. At times when I think too hard, it almost feels like emotional cheating UT I know this isn't true and again, this isn't something they chose or can control. However, when my stress and anxiety go up, my overthinking goes rampant, feeding oil to the flames wherever they can. In the past, they've often took these feelings for other romantically due to the intensity of these feelings and I have a constant fear of it pushing them to do things which would undermine our own relationship. It also doesn't help that social media has pushed a lot of toxic and negative thoughts into my head about things like this. Despite these reasons, I want to make clear that I understand that this is involuntary and my partner is in no way responsible for any of this. In fact they suffer very much from this as well, often telling me how much they love me and hating that they have these feelings for another person. Sad as it may be, there isn't much to be done about it and I want to do my best to continue to support and stay strong for them. I would appreciate any advice on how to better the situation and how to deal with these feelings of mine, or maybe give any of your thoughts and opinions. ",

Essentially, one can present the most irrefutable argument and the opposition, knowing that what they have to say is going down in flames, will tell you to say it nicely as a way of detailing you. To use an example from my real life, there was a time during which my sister would grab me by the genitals and squeeze/twist just for the fun of it. Eventually, after doing this one too many times, I punched her in the head so hard that she fell to the ground and streamed. Hours later, my masculine gene pool hitter, aka Shitbreath, called me up for an explanation. I very calmly stated that sister had been for over a month grabbing my nuts or balls or whatever and hurting me, and because I knew he would not do anything, I took matters into my own hands and punched her. Shitbreath said, quote, Baphomet In and would not make another sound. Just lied back with his eyes closed and would not even acknowledge my presence, no matter how loudly and angrily I tried to remind him that she was the one who assaulted me in the beginning. Grabbing a person's genitals and washing them like that is, in fact, sexual assault. I should have called the cops. But anyway, Shitbreath's behaviour is an example of Tone Policing. That is, he told me to say it the way he wanted, and then refused to even listen to me. To this day I have all manner of regret trips circling in my head ranging from regretting not physically attacking him to not going and getting petrol and setting him on fire. A great memory to have from when you were twelve years old. Oh, and just in case you thought sister was the only member of the Shitbreath family who has sexually assaulted me. well, you get the idea. Are they going to say that in court? Testicles, Baphomet In Steel? I would love to see how the judge responds to that. When you violate my personal space or my body, you have no right to tell me I have to be polite to you. If I am talking about someone hurting me in a real physical way, I am under no onus to talk about it in a way that is pleasing to you. You are the one who is obligated to either do something or get the funk out of my way. Some links pieces of text follow:. In particular note these words: Keith Bybee's How Civility Works, he notes that feminists, protesters, and anti-war protesters have been told to down and try to be more He argues that tone policing is a means to deflect attention from injustice and relocate the problem in the style of the complaint, rather than address the complaint I pasted them here so you cannot refuse to read the link and not see this point. Emphasis mine. So to close, it is one thing to try to soothe a person who is in distress and needs to communicate something. Quite another to tell them to be polite when they are trying to tell you that someone has assaulted them. And if you are thinking of telling someone that they do not have an excuse to be impolite, funk off. ",

    "text": "Hello, sorry this is my first post so not 100% sure how to go about this. I have been on Trazadone and Prozac for about a month now, and I do not know if what Im feeling is what is right or if I need to try something else. A bit of background, Ive been taking Trazodone and the Prozac, for just over a month now. I have not been anxious about what Im usually anxious about (I was diagnosed with TSD due to abuse I dealt with as a child that resurfaced as an adult), like my past and such. But I originally started the medication because I was feeling overwhelmed about everything, so much so, that I was not attending my classes, handing in assignments nor maintaining my job. Since taking the medication, I still feel incredibly overwhelmed, but its almost like I no longer care as much about what I have to do. I believe I have ADHD, as that was what my therapist referred me to. This was never confirmed, as I took an ADHD test with a Psyche and she told me my In was too high to be considered ADHD. I am somewhat smart, but I believe this is because I just enjoy learning about different things all the time. So, I was really confused when she told me this, because I dont believe ADHD and In are connected in that way. Since taking my other mens, I have struggled to make it to class, to work, and to use social media. I never answer anyone texts nor do I feel the need to hand in homework or go to class. It especially sucks, since I stopped feeling incredibly stressed, yet I still cant attend my classes nor do my classwork. I do not know if I have ADHD or if I have just lost motivation, but I just wanna ask those with ADHD, like how were you positive you had ADHD? Ive taken adderall before and my brain felt calm but I am not sure if that is a common theme of ADHD or if thats just how my brain dealt with the adderall. Anyway, any support or info would help Thank you. ",

She just found out today that she has covid and has to be getting a lot of rest, enough that I've barely spoken to her the last three days due to her not feeling well. And while I'm doing my best to support her and give the space and quiet she needs to recover I feel this fairly intense sense of anxiety that only really goes away when she's here. this is nothing new. It's been a reoccurring problem with me, though I only recently learned it's not normal to feel like this when away from a partner. I'm having an especially hard time with this for several reasons. To start, I always have an incredibly difficult time sleeping when I'm feeling like this. A majority of the time I literally can't sleep at all. second, it makes it very hard to enjoy anything. The anxiety is intense enough that I find it really difficult to play games or watch things or even engage in my normal hobbies. The anxiety is omnipresent, and is a pain to distract myself from. I also find it really difficult to speak to others or do anything but self isolate. third, the anxiety has a tendency to so to speak. It'll start off fine but will slowly become more and more severe as the hours go by. If it lasts long enough, I'll eventually start crying due to the overwhelming and intense feelings. fourth, it leads to a lot of self destructive and toxic behaviors. I start having panic attacks and sometimes I'll overthink to the point of anger and lash out at her. I always feel incredibly guilty when this happens and I'm trying to l my hardest to manage this all but I have no idea how. any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "text": "For context: I have Bipolar Type I. I have been way more stressed recently as I'm doing a DB program, and in doing this I've stopped numbing myself and all the trauma I've been withholding is finally unleashing its fiery wrath upon me. It doesn't help that I live with the very same people giving me that trauma, and I don't know if there is anything I can do about it (or can I? I wouldn't know, I'm pretty sure I've been gaslighted for years). I also do weed semi-occasionally (every now and then, but it's consistent in that it always happened eventually - for the past 2-3 years). I'm assuming this is definitely the culprit of these weird derealization moments. So here's what happens: when I get insanely stressed (and that's saying a lot since literally, every single day is just stress), I try to use some distress tolerance skills. It works for a bit to cause me not to have an ACTUAL breakdown (usually because I have to do something at hand, and don't have the ability to breakdown right now). But then, I get sleepy. REALLY sleepy. Once I close my eyes and drift off, the people talking soon become muffled noises, and then to voices that I straight up. don't hear? Except I do hear them and I know they're talking, but I get so absorbed in my mind because of that sleepiness that, although I register that they're talking, some part of my brain turns off that comprehension/awareness component. ? Like it suddenly doesn't care about the fact that there is literally sound in my near surroundings. Then, when I drift off, my mind is literally running at like an insane speed on different topics. I have never even been able to recall NE topic. I just know that it's a bunch going at a very very fast speed, although it feels like I'm still able to somehow cover these topics in-depth, despite the fast speed. It feels like I'm sleeping, except I'm not. exactly. The second time around, the same sort of things started happening, I drift off, my mind disconnect from reality. but then today, everybody collectively stood up (I was in a church), and I heard rain instead? Like as if I was simply listening to really heavy rain hitting my house or something. It was either rain or just a really big overwhelming noise that I probably attributed to rain because of how loud rain is, too. Once I'm awake from this, I feel better. My mind stopped focusing on those really big stressors and I just got to rest for a bit, even though there were some really weird side effects to it. And, even though I'm pretty sure this is a pretty concerning issue, I also kinda don't want it to stop - it's the only way I've gotten my mind to fully just stop and allow me to reenter my surroundings as if nothing happened, which is honestly what I want really badly. I'd do anything to stop thinking about these things for a moment, even if I have to undergo that weird process. Aside from that, though, does anybody have any idea what this is or what it's called?

    "text": "cure BD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full . Just a thought experiment, when you read the quote, substitute the word BD, and change it to any physical illness, and ask yourself whether you would ever accept that as a good enough answer. To me that says nothing, like its as vague as it gets, while covering all angles. Im 22 and first time i had to go to therapy was in London, age 11 as social services came to my house and determined we had to have family therapy. Well lets just say the family part didn't register for my dad, as he just couldn't accept he was doing anything wrong, in fact, he was convinced no family would want me, and made it know. I went to therapy at 11 thinking i had to be fixed, and after only half a year of weekly sessions, i stopped going. I'd continue with my life have a couple months where you'd think im completely normal until inevitably i . This is what i did every single year till my 19th birthday. Always going to the therapist thinking im a broken watch that needs fixing, worst of all thinking someone knew how to fix it. Looking back, im surprised i didn't just give up sooner. As soon as i finished one therapy, my parents would find another, everytime telling me guy is really different, hes the real and i would believe it. I guess i really had no choice but to believe it, from a young age i knew i couldn't live that sort of life. From ages 11-18 i probably saw around 9 different therapists, from private to public, ive tried psychoanalysis, EMD, hypnotherapy, family therapy i mean you name it I've done it. I never got the cure i was looking for, instead what i did get is a different diagnosis each clinical depression, something like problems with authority, social anxiety, agoraphobia, depersonalisation, de realisation. I mean fuck, they threw the whole book at me and with that the more i felt like i needed to be cured. Clearly i was all the way sucked, further proven by the fact that at 18 i still had the same issues i had at 11. Having said this, i never questioned the therapies, clearly i was doing something wrong, or so i was made to believe. As is expected, after trying so many things while seeing 0 results what so ever, this being when i was 18, i was very much ready to just call it quits. This time i was more serious than ever, suicide was nothing new to me, but it was always in the somewhat near future. Not this time. This crisis was my lowest and toughest to that point, and if i hadn't made the following decision its very likely i wouldn't be here now. (It always fascinated me how strong our will to survive really is). Until now, i still didn't have the diagnosis of BD, i didn't know it existed. During this time as per usual, my parents were looking for the next best thing although this time it was different. My parents lived in spain at that point (i was living in london by myself) and they explained how there was this BD diagnosis that really seemed to fit my problems, and that there was this amazing day hospital in Madrid that was known world wide for being extremely good. I thought to myself, might as well try it for a couple months, i aint got shit to lose anyways. Soon after, i ended up back in Madrid and going to a day hospital which was specialised in first psychotic episodes, which also happened to accept BD, due to the fact that the one in charge actually specialised in BD. This was no joke success rate. Im not gonna lie the first few months went better than i could have imagined, fuck for the first time i was able to put a name to my problems, and not 10 different diagnosis. I had a therapist which clearly knew what i was talking about, which seems normal, but in my case very new. This was the first time in 10 years that i thought to myself, this is it, finally. I really put an effort to go every day, whenever we were given what i considered shit in occupational therapy i put my ego aside, i volunteered in anything they offered. I mean shit i was giving it my all. The night before my first day i'd promised myself i would give everything i could, including making myself talk in every session, no exceptions. At first i started to see some very obvious changes, i mean shit suddenly i didn't feel different, judged, misunderstood. We would have group therapies twice a week, and suddenly i realised my problems arent just mine, and turns out people have had it even worse. I guess you could call this the honeymoon period, and very useful at that, everyday that passed the closer i saw an end line (which to me was crazy, as for 10 years i couldn't see past the next day), i was gaining so much insight, the anger i felt towards my parents was getting smaller thanks to venting during therapies. I still was in complete awe of my psychiatrist, never had i felt like a therapist always seemed to understand everything i talked about. Really it was going as i hoped it would. Months went by, a year went by, and two years went by and at no point did i realise it was long ago i last saw a change. The last two years of me going to therapy was the same it always was, except this time i never stopped to question whether i was improving any longer. I was just going through the motions, wake up, go to therapy, talk about your problems, sleep. every day until the inevitable crisis came. And once again wake up, go to therapy, talk about my problems and so on. Suddenly, therapy is all i knew and ironically at that point my stigma was even worse to how it was in London. But i just continued, whenever i had a crisis i was told that every crisis teaches you something new, that it was my fault cos clearly i was doing something wrong. Once the crisis was no longer there id have my ego boosted by all the staff saying how much better i looked, how very soon ill be able to leave and have a normal life. I believed all of this, not once did i question the therapy, i just trusted my psychiatrist whenever hed tell me i just need q bit more time, and try this and try that. Within two and a half years of being in the center, i had been hospitalised plenty of times from the reoccurring crisis, basically failed to accomplish every single task i set myself. However this is easy say with hindsight, because let me tell you, even at this point i had this blind faith that this was all part of the bigger picture, that i had learned something different and that id be cured. Just 3 months before i was let go, the cure seemed to be right in front of me. Things seemed to be going fine, i was gonna start school in a month, all the therapists said i had done it. Shit it really seemed that way, at that moment anyways. School started, surprise surprise yet another crisis, although this time, i had a pretty serious overdose. But just like always as soon as i composed myself i went back to the day hospital, apologised, asked to get another chance (this still blows my mind) and was accepted back in. With no time to waste, my therapist made it very clear, if you cant study you have to work. Not one week later i found a job in construction as i was told, after a couple weeks i seemed to be in crisis again. I let my therapist know, but as always told me to ignore the symptoms and continue as i had to fight it. Only lasted two weeks until the next crisis came, and with that a couple more overdose. Once again i was feeling that desperation i had long forgotten, i started to realise this shit aint going nowhere. As what had now become a norm, as soon as i was able to function again, i went back to the day hospital with an apology in mind. I sat in my therapists office, and before i could say anything i was given the news i could no longer go there. It was surreal, that feeling of being a family, that i was somehow special because i was the only one with BD that was left. Striking my ego as I'd convince myself i was working harder, listening better than all the other ones with my disorder. And realising its just happened to me. Its been almost 3 months since that happened. First month was very difficult, with very negative a destructive thoughts and behaviours. At some point i started reflecting on the situation. They way i was just suddenly let go didnt feel right, i couldn't figure out why, but it It was like a puzzle, slowly finding more pieces. Except each piece had q question, not an answer. First thing was, how did he go from telling me hes so proud of my hard work to saying since i started i have just done things my way? Did i really not follow his method? . I didn't really go any further than that until the following day. I was in the terrace, and id how to explain this, other than everything just made sense. But this didn't bring me peace, quite the opposite. Had i ever seen q single person since i was there? No. Why is it that all 9 patients with BD were kicked out for following Why did i get a tattoo of my therapist? Why have i told everyone hes saved my life? Why was i so convinced that i was always about to be cured? Not one time did i stop to realise i was literally having the same crisis, with the sam frequency, with the same anxiety etc as always. How the fuck is this possible? What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck did he get his reputation from? And why have i idolised him, so blindly without having seen any sort of proof? . I mean the idea, of not having solved a single one of my issues was completely crazy. I thought i was having a psychotic episode. I really just couldn't comprehend wtf was going on. How is it possible, that i was so sure that the end line was always just a couple steps infront of me, yet nothing changed. Its hard to even put in words what i was feeling, but best way of describing is that to me the realisation of this therapy having been no difference just seemed IMPOSSIBLE. I mean what about the 2 and a half years of therapy i just did, in this day hospital, with of THE best BD in the world. Always being reminded how lucky we were to be here, just like treating to let someone else instead of us. I was so confused that i was sure i had just spent 3 years in a cult. I couldn't find any other way to explain any of this. Everything just streamed cult, from the first day, where you get greeted by the saying how you've finally found the right place, instantly just in awe of my therapist (never happened before), shit even my dad was in love with him. Scratch that, everyone was he comes we shut up and listen. The way they tell you that they have the key that no one else does. The way you have to apologise and ask for more chances as if it was my fault, id get crisis trying what THEY told me to do. Not once in that time did i question weather things were working, everytime a friend was let go, I'd always get angry at them, as if it was their fault. I mean this one i fringe just saying it, but if there was a new guy that didn't wanna stay, me a would say to his face how he was wasting the chance of his life etc with such fucking conviction and somewhat superiority that still just makes my brain hurt. How? Saying it out loud just makes me feel retarded, and confused. Utf did i really do all this time. How is any of this possible. Took me a couple days to calm down, and only then did it occur to me that theres no way a public day hospital is a cult. But that doesn't mean it acts like one, giving hope to people that don't have it, promising a cure In they follow the insisting whenever you're not in crisis that youre almost cured, while blaming all the tough moments on you, until they let you go for Either way, its a fullproof method, if you get cured its thanks to the treatment, if you dont its patients fault. To this day, this shit feels like a big fucking manipulation, feels like ive been living a lie, that ive been played with. I decided to share my thoughts with all people from the center that i'd shared time to see what they thought. I can't lie up to this point i was still thinking i was probably psychotic. But no, ALL of them had the same experience. Not of the therapist being bad, no, of feeling played, lied to. I cant put my finger on what the centre is doing wrong, but something here is discussing. Now, you might be wondering why did i use that title? . Even though i still have a hard time making sense of this. One thing is very apparent to me, I've been looking at it all wrong. There is no step by step method, no one has one. If they did they'd be rich and famous, and in fact the clinical studies indicate that the only known is time. This means im now free to find what works for me, which means its M responsibility. This probably sounds so obvious but keep in mind since i was 11 this is what ive been told. Its very obvious many aspects of psychology are where medical science was 200 years ago. People theorising, with/without educated guesses. In no other field could you say . cure BD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full . CONCLUSION: Obviously this is a personal experience, and i only realised the in the therapies claiming they have the special sauce after having spent half my life in these places. I still see the use in therapy for BD, so long you have the right expectations and don't expect to be cured by someone other than you. Also once you've done enough therapy, start thinking for yourself + knowledge learnt. You're idea will be as good as the therapists (pure guess). P. S. the day hospital has its socialite with people like you, you feel understood, you have a daily routine, i learned a lot about myself through talking. All of this is more than any other therapy has done for me. I wanna make clear my issue, is with the fact that that promise a cure which doesn't exist, drag you along for years and when at some point give up and blame it on the patient. I think this is a very useful tool, just not the tool they advertise. Im not exaggerating, in terms of our difficulties, all 9 of us, are exactly where we started off. in our houses, confused on whats next. Interested to get feedback or questions. ",

I am just so sad and I feel like there is no root to why I feel like this. I look back at my life and don't see a point where I just became this way. I just know that I've felt this way for so long that it almost seems so normal. When at social gatherings I feel as though I'm watching everyone be happy and I'm almost watching from a distance when in reality I'm in the I feel so closed out from everyone but I can't find the strenh to try to talk to anyone because even that is hard. being with people is hard. living is hard when you don't know why you are like this and why your not social like everyone else. I have people tell me your lame your boring and I just respond by saying I know. It hurts but I think its the truth because I will talk to people laugh and 15 minutes later I have socially drained out and stopped talking. I see people have fun and wish I could laugh with them but I just it's gotten worse as time goes on where everything is almost meaningless. I wish I could fix this part of me so even my parents don't think I'm a owner or that I don't want to keep up a conversation with them. I want to so bad it hurts sometimes but I just genuinely can't and I am not sure why anymore. Life seems so hard now and I can't find a reason to keep going. Don't get me wrong I feel this way but I won't take it to the next step because the ties I have I know will make an impact but living is so hard all of a sudden. people might say well you are still so young but why do I feel like if I were to be gone tomorrow I feel like I would be alright and accept it. I am not sure why I feel like I've lived my life and now it's just dragging out for no reason at all. But if you were to ask me how are you all I would say is doing I won't self diagnose myself but I do know I am sad and it's not getting better anytime soon I think but I wish it would.

He couldve killed me two times but my love for him was deep and he never saw that. Sometimes I blame myself for the break up. he treated me different but i only felt like it was unique because Ive never experienced love from a man. I feel like he took advantage of that and decided to treat me less. My depression has never been this bad. I mean I am still eating but I have no motivation to shower or get out of bed or do my homework. Ive been traveling a lot to cope with the depression but it is not helping. I am still thinking about my abusive ex. My finances are deteriorating due to my sadness of wanting to feel happy and alive but no one knows what I am going through inside. There times where I want to quit everything and try to kill myself but I dont have the courage to do so. I am sick and tired of experiencing hurt in my life. Nothing has been happiness only chaos.

    "text": "Warning this is going to be a pretty long post but I hope you read all of it . Ok. So I don't know where to begin this so I guess I will just start out by saying that I'm currently a senior in high school. I've never really been the most social person growing up as I've always had few friends and I would always find it difficult to form new friendships. Especially in school, I find that everyone is kind and generally friendly towards me yet I feel like all my fellow classmates consider me more as an acquittance than a genuine friend and this goes both ways. I especially feel this when we do group projects and I'm always scrambling to find someone to work with as everyone partners up immediately once the project gets announced. It's not that I've not tried to make more friends as when I was new to the school in ninth grade I made an effort to talk with the kids in my grade and attempt to form friendships but it was to no avail. I noticed how despite my attempts at talking to them it didn't make a difference as I never felt like I was truly developing any friendships but rather that they were just being nice to me and responding to what I was saying. Halfway through ninth grade I kind of gave up on actively making friends as I threw myself into my school work. I always said to myself that I'll start making friends and hanging out with people once I get all straight A's in my classes as once that I've conquered the academic aspect of high school I will be able to move on the social aspect of high school. Plus, in my head I knew that I wouldn't see the majority of these people after high school so I didn't mind that I wasn't friends with many of them. Recently, though one of my classmates died in a car accident and the whole grade attended his funeral. I, myself did not know this person that well but I saw how everyone in my grade was in tears over this person's death. The person who died was generally popular within the grade and had been in the school district since kindergarten while as previously mentioned I moved in ninth grade. Yet, the thing that occurred to me while at the funeral was that if I would have died in that car accident in the place of my fellow classmate would anyone of my fellow classmates care that I was gone compared to him. I honestly believe that while the students and even teachers would be sad it would be no where near as much as the sadness they felt for my fellow classmate. Why is that I thought. Well the most obvious answer would be that they simply knew him way better than they knew me as he had many friends and was apart of many different clubs. While, I was apart of a few clubs yet despite only being in a few clubs (three to be exact) I tried many different clubs throughout high school but none of them fit. As I was never interested in Debate, Model Up, or Science Olympiad despite attending multiple meetings for each club. Also, to be honest apart of me didn't like that the amount of public speaking that was involved with each of these clubs. Now let me say that I've sang individually in front of tons of people on numerous occasions and I kind of like the idea of being the center of attention for a brief moment in time. Yet, for some reason when I was in these clubs I was so afraid of actually speaking as I was afraid of what others may think and that they may consider me to be dumb or stupid. Going back to school, now that I'm towards the end of my senior year and most of my fellow classmates and myself are receiving our college decisions back I feel a bit disappointed as despite me saying that I'm putting one hundred percent focus in my school work and even foregoing many friendships as a result I still only managed to have a 3. 7 unweighted PA with a 1440 AT superscore that only happened after taking the exam six times. Also I underperformed on my A exams in my junior year which is the most crucial year of high school. Alternatively, my peers in school who despite hanging out with friends on weekends and being apart of many different clubs still managed to have a higher PA, standardized test score, and A exam score. To be honest, that made me very angry as despite me only focusing on school there were able to focus on so many other things and yet they were still able to succeed in school more than I did. At school, I always wanted to be known as the person who was really intelligent. I would love when people would complement me on how smart I was even when I knew deep down it wasn't true as I always had to put in more effort than most students to achieve high grades and even when people asked me how I did on tests I would give a superficial smile and say the highest grade I could think of while also being a little realistic. I'd also get very jealous of the kids in the grade as not only were they super popular and part of a variety of clubs but people would always complement them and things came so naturally to them unlike for me. Even today as I hear back from colleges I'm disappointed that my stats were too low for me to gain admission to any legitimate top twenty school. Even schools that I thought I had a good chance of getting into I did not receive admission such as the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, UCLA, and University of Virginia. I know college admissions is based on luck to a great extent but I still feel angry and disappointed that despite putting my all into my studies I still wasn't able to get the grades that I wanted to attend a top tier school. I always figured that I deserved it since I decided to sacrifice so many other aspects of my life. Now I also wanted to touch upon my dreams and aspirations. Ever since I was little I always wanted to be an actor I was mesmerized by actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Johnny Deep, Tom Cruise, etc. I also genuinely had a passion for film and I wanted nothing more than to be apart of the process. I expressed this desire to my parents when I was young and even attended some acting classes in the city but nothing much ever came of it. Since then whenever I brought up my desire to pursue an acting or even singing career they told me that it was ridiculous as I don't have the personality to be an actor or a singer in their eyes because of how I'm very introverted and thus should stick to something more practical. But yet even today I still have desires for an acting career as I spend hours watching films and copying facial expressions of famous actors in order to improve my acting ability. I also spend hours vividly daydreaming about what my life maybe like as an actor. I think about the films that I would star in, the plot and title of each film, the A-list actors that would be in the films, and how successful each of my films would be at the box office and with critics. I know it sounds insane talking about it but I'd also spent time daydreaming about winning an Oscar and what exactly I would say when I'd win and which A-list actors would be present to hear my acceptance speech. I also daydreamed about being apart of a vocal group that I called The group would have eight members including myself (four guys and four girls) and we would all live in a two hundred million dollar Bel-Air estate that I had once seen on Willow. I imagined how I would be filming a movie during the day and then writing music with my fellow members at night. I imagined that I had the most amount of instagram and twitter followers than anyone in the world by a milestone. I also imagined how I would portray the character of Spiderman in a Spiderman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Then I imagined that while portraying Spiderman I will also play Batman in a film series directed by Aaron Sorkin. I imagined myself being warmed by fans on a daily basis more than even Michael Jackson. I also imagined how all the members of will be super famous as well as they will also have the highest instagram and twitter following right behind me. Also each member of will dominate in a specific area within the entertainment industry for me that is acting for the other members that maybe modeling, literary publishing, or directing. I also imagine how out of the four girls of I would date the most popular and beautiful one who would be a brunette and everyone would see us as a bigger power couple than Brangelina. I'd look at brunette girls my own age on Instagram and imagine that they would be the member that I would date. Also the second most beautiful member would be a blonde who would be best friends with the brunette member and both of them would have major crushes on me and I would have to decide which one I'd want to date. I'm sorry if that last paragraph was a lot to read but I really wanted you all to understand what is going on in my head for the last few years especially. Another thing that has bothered me for a while especially since I've joined high school was whether or not I was good looking. I always wanted to be an extremely attractive person as I wanted people to admire my looks the way they do for Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt. I constantly asked my family if they thought I was handsome as I was too afraid to ask any of my friends in fear that they would think I was weird or anyone else for that matter. They would always tell me that I am but I always felt like there was a problem as despite even me thinking that I'm handsome, I never got any attention from girls my own age. Now this could be because I barely interact with girls in my school and when I do it is only for school related matters but I always thought even then that at least a few girls would show some interest in me but nothing of the sort ever happened. Furthermore, it is not like the girls in my school don't have crushes on guys as I've heard them speak about their guy crushes in the past and personally I was shocked as I genuinely believe that I'm way better looking than the guys that they were crushing on. I mean it's not like I have a serious crush on any girl in my school in fact I find most of them to be unattractive with the exception of a handful of girls in my grade. Also in recent years I've grown to have a strong love for teen dramas. Particularly since the beginning of high school I've watched teen dramas such as Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The Secret Life of The American Teenager, Riverdale, The OC, Beverly Hills 90210, The Vampire Diaries, Freaks Geeks, and Euphoria. When I'd watch each one of these shows not only did I obsess over the shows but also the cast as I learned so much about each and every one of their professional and personal lives. I would ship characters from the show and be extremely disappointed if they didn't end up together despite me knowing that at the end of the day it doesn't really matter because these characters don't exist in reality. Also being a guy watching teen dramas made me insecure as no other guy my age that I know of spent this much time on teen dramas as they would be more prompted to watch sports or some other show. Don't get me wrong I do watch other shows as I'm a fan of Cobra Kai which while it does have some teen drama in it, it is more of a karate soap opera than a straight up teen drama. Likewise, I also enjoy watching shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy as I've always found them hilarious. Yet, when watching teen dramas I think what appeals to me the most about them is the fact that they are so different from my life as a high school student. As a current senior in high school I've never taken in any drugs or alcohol my whole life. Due to this at times I catch myself judging people in my school who have taken drugs or alcohol as I believe that I have more will power than them and that I must have a better home life that doesn't make me go towards alcohol and drugs. I also constantly search up celebs using drugs as I realize that similar to classmates I shame them to as I can't understand why anyone would do drugs in the first place. Furthermore, one of the things that disappoint me the most in my life is that I've never had a girlfriend, got laid, or even properly kissed. There was a time when I was eight years old that a girl and I shared a kiss for a second but that is the extent of my sexual experiences. I know that this isn't a big deal as plenty of guys my age have yet to have their first proper kiss as well but I still feel like I missed out on that experience that I should have had when I was young. I told my parents that I wanted to major in business and I'm interested in the business side of the entertainment industry. Additionally, I also said that I could possibly major in Economics and maybe work in an investment banking firm one day. To be honest, the only reason that I would ever want to work in an investment banking firm is so that I could have a lot of money and hopefully retire young and never have to work again. Despite, what I said earlier my parents do want me to pursue my interests as long as it is reasonable. My dad in particular has noticed these past few years that I never really ask for stuff and he always tells me how he is worried about how I'm going to manage in the real world as he thinks I'm too introverted. I believe that while I am indeed introverted I still talk to people and while I don't necessarily go out of my way to make conversation most of the time I still talk confidently when spoken to by an adult or someone my own age. I think my biggest fear is living a life filled with regret. I have been having all these thoughts and emotions for a while now and I really needed a place to vent it all out. Finally, I want to end off talking about some of my physical tico. My family has noticed over the past year that when I listen to a song I really like I would get out of my chair and stand while clipping my hands with my arms fully extended at the front and back of my body while saying back and forth. Also, when I get any test back in school my hands start to get pins and needles as I await for the test results. I've noticed that especially this year I've become increasingly disillusioned with school as every day that I'm in school I'm just waiting to get out of school and go home so that I could sit at my desk in my room and watch animated stories or videos by my favorite youtubers. Don't get me wrong I still complete all my homework and study for tests it's just that while I'm doing that I also am also on Youtube watching different videos for hours on end and thus homework that could have taken half an hour now takes two hours. I also stay awake till midnight on weekdays watching videos after I finished all my work as I don't want the day to get over and go to school again in the morning. My dad always asks me why I'm so introverted as he considers me to be the black sheep of the family opposed to him, my brother, and mother. Till date I don't know the true answer. I notice how a lot of the times in school something funny may happen and while the whole class is laughing I'm the only one having to fake the laughter feeling like an outcast. So if you can please share with me your thoughts that would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "text": "Yes been married to my mom for almost 17yrs (he and my mom married when I was 5 months old, even though they had my brother by then, he was 5 1/2. ) Thats not to say their relationship is healthy though, theres no doubt at all that its not. They both failed to raise their son (my brother) effectively to a point where my brother, an adult, is now in rehab, has not gone to college and cant rally hold down a job. My dad, I feel, has a lot to do with that. I remember that my dad has always been kind of off and been verbally abusive toward my older brother. My brother was still well behaved for a while though up until he was in high school when he understandably started having issues. As recently as a few months ago, I remember my dad was arguing w my mom when my brother was home (my brother argued w both my parents a lot) abt how if my mom had let him beat my brother when my brother was little he wouldnt have turned out like this. I cant imagine saying something like that about my son who had been in a mental hospital two years or so before. He also seemed more concerned abt how it was embarrassing both times when the police came over bc my brother and I said we were considering ending our lives. He was still kind of fake abt it with me and said I could talk to him and all even though I actually really cant. I remember actually when the police were called a 2nd time more recently he said he and my mom would take my phone away if it happened again (theyre both very paranoid. They always talk abt gang stalking and lights being clashed theyre both weird and likely mentally unwell its why theyre been together for so long in my opinion) and he said at a separate point hed leave if it happened again . He complained abt my mom not working (she was a housewife and used to be p good at it. ) Yes been a security guard since I was born apparently or something like that, at the same place. He doesnt bring in enough money for us to rally id be okay without my mom working or at least he didnt (were okay now I wear braces and we have a To set) my mom quit her job due to the vaccine and were been okay but my moms mental health has declined in the past few years thats quite clear to me. Yes arguably a negligent parent. I dont have much of a relationship w him even though he works, and My mom has admitted if she weren around she doesnt know hed be cooking for us (my moms not a good parent herself but shes still a better parent than he is, always has been. ) He can be somewhat more understanding abt my perspective than my mom is and wasnt super private abt the fact that I was his favorite child. My mom said she could tell I was his favorite child . Yes not the most intelligent? He has nice handwriting but you can tell when he talks that hes not that smart or like he understands things but is kind of off and not that smart . Yes kind of boring he smoke weed w my mom sometimes id. Yes rally not a good father I have questioned his decision to even have kids w my mom multiple times. My mom j seems happy that he stayed around at all. I feel like I dont understand him. He also drinks a lot but he doesnt run around beating us or anything hell j maybe talk some shit or act dumb when hes been drinking. Id say hes an alcoholic but I cant help my parents w all their problems the way he and my mom are does play into my depression though. Yes not a good make role model . My mom once mentioned he didnt work for a year after his dad died but didnt cry at his funeral (my grandpa used to beat him. ) Yes a lot weirder than his family members but I actually rally dont know why? My aunts and uncles seem more normal compared to him id but its not like they seem to have noticed anything. The extended family isnt 100% normal either. I dont see how hes surprised that his son turned out the way he did. Honestly if a guy like my dad can get married I think anyone can. He stayed w my mom even tho my mom mentioned she used to have trouble holding down guys or smthn even though shes conventionally attractive (she looks way better than my dad) bc she was crazy. Said she was always throwing things and trying to fight ppl she seems to think my dad is a good guy bc he never beat her. But he still talks shit abt her to me occasionally and stuff so I mean. Not like she chose well. ",

I left home permanently after giving up both the bottle and having much to do with their daily lives a while ago (those were two parts of the same problem, as you can imagine). Thing is, there's a sibling who's lived at home much longer, more consistently, basically their entire life by now, well into their thirties. They are jealous of even the most mundane improvement in my life - enough that it predictable spurs verbal abuse - and have a profound mental illness which goes untreated. From what I can tell, the non-enabling parent had a go of trying to get sibling to get a job again, and based off of enabled's tone and cryptic spread of information I'll have been the stupid shining example which caused sibling to physically threaten non-enabled this past morning. I'm pissed. I'm scared for both of them. I feel guilty for telling either of them how well yesterday had gone. I'm also reading the breakfast tomorrow. I fired off an email to enabled which stated in no uncertain but certainly harsh terms that however the will works out I won't be taking care of sibling (so they should stop imagining that), that refusing to deal with this now has led to a frail(ish) cancer survivor being credible threatened for daring to suggest sibling grow up a bit (this after sibling pushed enabled to the ground and gave me a black eye, two separate incidents among many), that the choice between enduring their abuse and life on the street isn't a choice for enabled regarding sibling in the medium to long term. I truly don't care about the inheritance - give it all to sibling, fine, they could use it - but my ego is in force, and I'm having trouble sleeping. Enabled is probably going to be siding with sibling and looking for a way to solve for me and non-enabled causing disruptions in their lives. Enabled will want me to take care of non-enabled while sibling gets last at reform, which will take the form of mental, possibly physical abuse for the rest of enabled's days, which. I don't want that. I very specifically want that not to happen at all. This shouldn't be. This is awful. ",

    "text": "I apologize in advance if I appear to gamble, misspell, or make any grammatical mistakes. I am also new to reddit, so I don't know how it completely works. I am mainly writing a post just to vent but definitely don't mind for advice and support. I have reached the lowest point in my life where I am afraid of the person I have become. Like a lot of us, we all know that life isn't all that great, but we often find some way to push however, I think I gave up. I often tell myself can never what's the and is nothing I can Oddly enough, when I tell myself this, I find peace. I am not suicidal but see no value in living or motivation to keep on going. I used to overthink and be highly pessimistic with the occasional panic attacks but now I only feel frustration and hatred to myself and world. I can't pin-point the exact moment where I changed but I can hypothesized that the last couple of years with the many tragic events that occurred, and my own personal experiences and failures resulted in this me. Sometimes, I realize that I shouldn't think like this because it will only bring my own downfall and right now is one of those moments. I am currently experiencing my academic, social, health, and work life sinking, my family relationships breaking, and an overall dislike of my fellow humans. All because I am not motivated to fix, do, or stop anything. Due to a personal experience, I have been depressed before where I didn't want to leave my bed or even shower. The only thing I did was cry and barely eat. it took me 3+ years to feel better and I overcame it as I surrounded myself with friends and do new experiences. Well, my recovery didn't last long because the COVID-19 Pandemic hit, lockdown, loss of friendships, isolation, economic crisis, death, civil unrest, the Ukraine crisis, glimpses of war, and etc. I myself got Covid and experienced a new wave of depression and I think I recovered in an unhealthy way. I became a nihilist, and I simply just don't care anymore. don't get me wrong, I don't actively try to lock myself in my room or choose to stay home. I still try to walk around, do things, go to class, work, and act like a perfectly functional human being. I do my best to conversate and talk to people but I still feel off. it just that I always have those thoughts in the back of my head of I feel like am not really living. When I am alone, all I have are those thoughts, so I find ways to distract myself doing things that aren't even anything close to productive. When I try to do something productive these thoughts fill my mind. Am I still depressed? . Is this a direct result of isolation? . Am I like this because I have been bottling my frustrations? . Do I need professional help? . I feel like anything I do is just going to end up in flames anyway and I see no point in doing anything. Well, i think me writing this post is me trying to tell myself that I can be better but there is just so much I have to do in order to fix myself and life. I simply want do things to distract myself from reality or sleep to escape it. I always wanted one day to become successful, find love, get married, and start a family but right now that just seems like a dream. this world is not fit for a person like me, nor do I want to start a family just for them to suffer. Today I spent it sleeping when I told myself to study and now, I am frustrated with myself and think I really do have a problem. Tomorrow I am going to try and better myself. I am not completely gone but I am afraid. I want to be motivated and I want to succeed it just difficult for me to care to do anything. I want to be happy am just lost. I just don't want to reach a point of no return. I feel compelled to fix my life because I know if I I will regret it. I just hate that I know that I am harming myself. I kind of just want the world to end but the only thing that is stopping me to fully commit to that thought is that I still have chance to be better. nihilism:. 1. the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless. synonyms: lack of conviction absence of moral values . 2.

    "text": ". Here are some things that helped me at low points. Keep a tooth brush in the shower, so when youre conditioning it is easier for you to. Clean your teeth. Even if you just scrub without toothpaste, you remove some plaque. Bar soup instead of loofa, takes less effort. Easier to hit the important parts -tits, pits and ass. Cleaning theses area make ya feel nice . Get flavoured fuzzy water - compliments peach is my favourite from sobeys. Helped me drink water when I was in a low place . Instead of cutting - smoke weed. Always have snacks available, its much easier than cooking and cleaning. Yogurt cups, baby bells, gold fish, etc. Are all easy things to just grab and have a small snack. -eating a bit is better than nothing at all . NEVER feel guilty or let someone make you feel guilty for sleeping. If youre body is telling you that it needs 20 hours of sleep, then so be it. It is your mind healing. I called my illness a name, it helped me figure out which voice was mine and what wasnt. Then I started talking shit about the voice haha. This always helped me explain to my partner what I was going through . If you can, try medication. It is not as scary as it seems, and it works. If youre feeling up to it, the gym is a fabulous way to help your mental health. The very hardest part is getting there. Once youre there, it becomes easier. So if you challenge yourself to go 3-4 times a week. You can even go for 15 minutes and walk on the treadmill the whole time. The hardest part is showing up. really stick with it for two Months, you will fall into routine and habit and it doesnt take all that energy to get there. I get energized from gym now when it used to exhaust me (took about 6 months of consistently going) . Start living life for you. This is your life, do what makes you feel happy and good. Deleting social media - this was the biggest turning point in my mental health. It is toxic and you have instant access to the worse possible news. You dont need to keep. Tabs on peoples lives that you never even liked in the first place. Dont worry about posting a story when youre out, just be in the moment. Mindfulness is key. Comment any of yours that could help others out. ",

    "text": "And I can't really find out why I think like that. Also apologies for my bad english and anything harsh I might say without noticing it. I put in bold some words and sentences just to emphasise them. So you can kind of read what I wrote faster. And, just to be clear I do not want to stop these (sometimes extreme) thoughts/points of view. That's how I've been for years now. I definitely dont wanna get molded as society desires it, I absolutely do not feel being a part of it and, I'm just myself, better off alone, and this is it. Cut to the point. Simply speaking, in my opinion we should get purged from this planet. And I honestly mean it, no matter how drastic this point of view is. I think like so because we are all going to be at some point a nuisance to someone or something. Whether it affects people for a only few minutes or their entire lifetime, and whatever the reason or our age, it will happen. Whether we angered someone, made them cry, or horrified them, or anything else. It's inevitable. Besides that, most if not all the time, people will not care about any consequences of their actions unless they are directly impacted by it. What if someone did something really bad ? We barely know why, and we have no idea how to seriously help them ? Punish them. Put them in mental institutions. Put them in jails. Let them understand their wrongdoing by themselves if they can. Give them the death penalty if they killed others. eye for an that's what they say. Pure selfishness. In my opinion, we are able to live in society only because of rules that have to be set. These rules aren't made to be broken, but they often have issues. And because they're never fixed, harmony cannot exist. Only anarchy. And I believe it won't disappear unless all of us are united, which will probably never happen. There are many other things I could talk about, but it is completely pointless so I'm not going to do it. I do not plan making things change RL right now. But I'm seriously thinking that at some point in my life, I may try to show my point of view in a violent way. That when I plan to end my life for a second time, some people will have to as well. I'm not trying to bag about anything. I am not trying to invent myself a personality trough words, nor it is a way of thinking you could temporarily have after watching a movie you felt immersed into. I'm being as honest as I can, I've always had a similar way of thinking where I'm quite simply fed up of everything. And that feeling is definitely worsening over years. I know it isn't how I should think. But as I said I do not want to think differently because I wont recognise myself anymore. Whatever that must happen will happen, and that will not change. I'm just trying to understand why exactly do I think like that. Is it because I've always lived away from society ? Because i've always been alone since my childhood, because I've always felt uncomfortable talking and listening to people, is it another reason ? Because I've been depressive for nearly 10 years, because I had suicidal thoughts for a long while, because I tried to kill myself once ? Is it because I've always forced myself to be as void of emotions as I can ? Or is it because I forced myself to always be pessimist, in order not to feel down if something isn't up to my expectations ? . Maybe a bit of all that, actually. Maybe it's simply due to my past life, and how I decided to react to it. But I just wanna know why is it M that is like that, and not a random person in the world. To be clear this isn't a call for distress. I'm just kind of lost, and fed up of everything. TLDR : I'm not playing a role or anything. I feel like humanity is a disease, as we are all selfish and a nuisance to others at some point (if not our whole lifetime). I'm fed up of everything that happens on this planet, I'm also quite lost as I am yet to find a valid reason to not stay at bed all day long, and I'm seriously thinking that I might wanna show my point of view in a violent way (En:Taking people with me) when I give up on living. To be very clear, this is not what I want right now and I hope it will not be the case at some point. But I know nothing would stop me from doing it, and that my thoughts are only worsening over time. So yeah, that's it. Thanks in advance for answering my question by the way. ",

    "text": "Content warning for this, mentions self harm, mentions suicide. I will get straight to the point, Im too contradictory with the symptoms I think I have for several mental illnesses. Im not officially diagnosed, and I read that as as long as you arent diagnosed you arent mentally ill so I have to keep my mouth shut because if I say anything like Im mentally ill Im faking it. Three mental illnesses I suspect I have. Or Im faking all of them, I dont even know anymore. CD - Rapid intrusive thoughts, but they dont stick to my head the whole day. Sure, Ill have guilt surges, sure, theyll stick to me for an hour or so. But that means nothing, Im not experiencing them like beating and they live in the back of my head where I do quick hush noises to them. I have instances where I feel uneven where I need to spin a certain number or times or I need to turn my right hand some few times so it even out in use with my left. but thats probably just perfectionism. I sometimes use God as a gateway to get out of my intrusive thoughts by repeating the same thing over and over again until the guilt I mentioned earlier is gone. Im not even that religious. ADHD - I can remember chemistry problems, I can remember French words. Int the big thing with ADHD revolving around hard time remembering things? I dont remember simple tasks or reminders I forget on my phone, but I feel like its impossible if I can in fact remember chemistry equations or French words really well. Im not even that interested in those classes. I dont think I have hyperfixations. What would that even be? I heard that they make you stay up all night or drive you to do things and think about them all day. My own characters, I guess? I think about them a lot and I almost never dont and apply them to situations they arent even brought up in. But isnt that just the regular creative process? I also widget a lot but a lot of people widget a lot. I remember to brush my teeth every day thanks to my reminders but Im remembering my reminder in the morning every day so wouldnt that contradict earlier? I have mood swings but theyre probably normal, I dont feel like I really understand what is normal for people probably because there is nothing to understand and I am just a normal person who cries for attention. I cry one minute and am laughing at something the next but Ive seen others do that so its normal. I only find myself with executive dysfunction when I do art sometimes but thats just laziness and not what actual ed is, Im pretty sure. idea if I have rejection sensitive dysphoria. Everyone loses items one time and the next. Being autistic - People say I could be autistic theyre so wrong. Why can I make eye contact sometimes? I started my sister in the eyes for over 10 seconds today Im pretty sure that counts as not having trouble with eye contact. I look off usually but id why I do I focus better that way but I can make eye contact normally I think. I do stems but I think that is just fidgeting and not swimming that Im doing actually. I say I dont like physical contact but my friend held pinkies with me and it didnt bother me and my relative was in the car with me and was pressed against me physically because it was cramped and I wasnt breaking out like I should have totally been doing. I think I fake it so I can act like Im a lone wolf or something stupid like that. I clinch at touch sometimes for stupid attention probably. I have a hard time talking to people like starting conversations but I can get loud and hold one about a few topics and approach teachers in school just fine. I dont think that means I have a social disorder, right? Im probably lying about thinking of having it for fun so I can join other people. Other things - I self harm a lot like I slam my head when something isnt perfect or right in my mind or when I make someone upset in a conversation. I scratch myself or cruise myself for the same thing. A few times I tried cutting with a knife in my kitchen. And then I didnt keep doing it because I got scared because I dont really self harm in a hurting way. Another attention thing. I think a lot about how the people around me are better off without me or would leave me in a heartbeat and I idealized committing suicide but I think thats just me romanticizing the idea of it so people can give me attention. But I also dont like thinking about the people I love coming into the bathroom or something and seeing me dead. id its sick and twisted how I use other peoples real struggles for a crumbs of attention by faking it. I never had isolation problems I just chose to not talk to the people around me and act like I have issues. My mom was right I tell other people I have problems I dont actually deal with so theyll have pity for me and give me attention. I dont freak out in loud crowds or around people and I dont have panic attacks like any person with this or the other mental illnesses would. I couldnt have it. Sorry, I wanted to say this. I wanted to confess id this feels like a cry for help and I really hate feeling this way. I try to look for things to confirm Im faking it all. Sorry. Just remember I dont actually have any mental illnesses yet these are just contradictory symptoms of things I think I could have. Im currently healthy because Im not diagnosed. dw about me.

    "text": "So for context I have depression and anxiety and have for a few years. In the past 3-4 months both my mental and physical health has been deteriorating. Physically, I constantly feel tired (even if im motivated to do something my body feels genuinely exhausted), i get bad brain fog where i cant remember much or focus on anything, headaches and stomach pain. On top of this, even when I get a full 8 hours sleep it doesnt feel satisfying and I feel equally tired throughout the day. Mentally, recently my symptoms have gotten so much worse. Instead of just feeling depressed and unmotivated, I get in weird moods where its like im detached/disconnected from the place im in and i feel intensely depressed, like im about to have some sort of mental break. When I get in these moods I feel like I have to be alone, which is difficult because I just moved in with my girlfriend and I hate wanting to be alone all the time when were doing something. On top of these feelings I also suffer from crippling anxiety (eg. panic attacks) as well as recently CD intrusive thoughts patterns. I feel like I can never get better. Ive gotten blood tests done and been told nothing is wrong with me. Been to psychologists but that didnt seem to help. I just started on Valdoxen (Agomelatine) recently but that hasn had a noticeable effect yet. I try to get myself in better habits but I feel so physically unwell all the time that its hard to even get off the couch sometimes. Im just at a lost place and I desperately want to get better. Im only 20, I want to be living my life and pursuing my passions rather then at home miserable and sick all the time. I also feel like its affecting my relationship in that im always down about something, I want to be a beacon of positivity and good energy not the opposite.

So in plane my imagination rains free control. I don't tell it to do anything it just does whatever it wants. Unlike my normal imagination which I can sort of feel in my brain, plain is on the backdrop of real life. I can chose to join plane but only in curtain situations can I leave plane on my own will. I ensentually get trapped in plain. Unable to tell what's real and what's not. I am transgender female so I have my ideal body. And I operate in plane alot more than irl. That tends to mean that I don't take care of my irl body much. And I have an intense feeling that my irl body isn't mine. Which I guess is normal but is plane normal. I can interact with plane via what I call a plane body. It is my ideal body merged with my irl body. But I can have agumentations and to my plane body. Like for instance. I can't interact with plane objects and physics using the motor commands for my normal body. I have to you serperart comments in my brain to move my body. Like you tell your finger to move. I do the same for my irl body but I can also move a finger serperart of moving my irl finger. Plane is my imagination layered onto of reality. I do have a normal imagination and a normal reality but I am often stuck in plane. And unable to see just normal reality. In both situations I still have my imagination. This has lead to some disturbing things I have been able to do without really have the irl materials such as committing a murder out of anger which was done completely in plane.

I had one friend who became my security blanket, and socializing was easy with her.

    "text": "Hey,. So I have health anxiety and got blood work done. Results will be posted in a couple weeks I believe. I am not currently diagnosed with any medical conditions. I am vaccinated (two Pfizer). Had multiple nasty infections last year that were, in short, caused by a bike accident. However, lymph nodes are a major cause of my health anxiety. Right now I'm concerned with two knots which are in the exact same spot on opposite sides. I barely felt them a few months ago and assumed it was a muscle or tendon since they were literally in the same spot. There is one on each side above my collarbone. Not on my neck but in that little pocket you can create while shrugging. Supraclavicular fossa is the specific name for the location I believe. Around that area (lol - no expert). Anyway, I have these soft and movable jumps on each side. At least they feel like jumps. Are they lymph nodes? If so they seem large. Maybe like a quarter in size. Give or take. Sort of like an oval in shape. To be fair, they haven't seem to grow at all since I last felt them which was late last year. No fever, no night seats, no trouble breathing, etc. I had a cold where I coughed and sneezed a lot a month ago but all symptoms went away. Also, you cannot see the two jumps unless I tilt my head to other side, shrub my shoulders, and try to flex my neck a little bit. At that point you can clearly see them in person. It's really hard to get them on camera with the lighting. You can most certainly feel them. I have absolutely no clue what the hell they are and why one is on both sides. It doesn't seem to be apart of my anatomy. Seems abnormal. Thoughts? Experiences? Suggestions? . I'll bring it up to my doc. Can't believe I forgot. They don't hurt at all. ",

    "text": ". At what age should parents talk to their kids about tragedy, death or what they might see in the news? . Developmentally, children typically dont begin to have an understanding of the concept of death until around the ages of 4 to 6 and dont go on to understand the permanency of death until around the ages of 7 to 11, , psychotherapist and of When Someone Dies: A Childrens Mindful How-To Guide on Grief and Loss, told In The Know by Yahoo. Despite this, there are ways we can introduce children to concepts like death and loss as young as 2 to 3 years old. And many experts agree it can be helpful to normalize these concepts early on and before kids are exposed to a more significant loss (if possible), Born continued. In fact, according to child psychologist , its at this young age that kids first begin to develop empathy for other peoples feelings. Research has shown that around 2 years of age, children start to develop an emotion vocabulary, show genuine empathy understand how other people feel even when they dont feel the same way themselves, Search-Page told In The Know. From a grief and tragedy standpoint, not only can they experience another persons pain, but they may try to soothe it and have big questions. Making death and/or tragedy a part of normal conversations is vital for children of all ages (even as young as 3) and can lay the groundwork for future conversations, Search-Page continued. However, although we can introduce our children to the idea of death and dying early on, Born says it may be helpful to wait until kids are older and better equipped to handle such heavy conversations. While we can introduce our children to the idea of death and dying early on, when it comes to indirect proximity to tragedy or loss on the news or in the media, it may be helpful to wait to talk about these issues until they are school-aged and more equipped to understand these conversations, said Born.

    "text": "Hello everyone, I think its time to ask for help. 2020 was a hard year for all of us, but for me it was hard for more than just COVID. A little bit of a background-. In April 2020 my brother was diagnosed with melanoma, it was devastating, but luckily pretty soon it turned out to be an early case and his life was saved in a surgery. The months after weren easy with some other bad stuff happening to my family (car accidents etc), but the worse happened in June. My dog (who was 6 years old at the time, I was 18) turned sick. At first we thought it was a cold, but I had a feeling something really wrong was happening and that she was dying. The local vet wasnt impressed and labs came back fine. Within a week it got to the point where she couldnt breath. One night was hard in particular and we thought she might not survive it. The morning after my parents took her to a veterinarian hospital and they found out she had a huge mass compressing her entire chest. Being at the hospital my parents called me crying, they said the vets have to do a procedure that might kill her on the spot. I cried until they returned from the hospital with her. My family and I were devastated, we couldnt understand how this is happening to us for the second time in 2 months. The same night (at midnight) the pathologist called saying she has a lymphoma. Few days after we started chemotherapy and we were told she would survive for 9-12 months depending on the aggressiveness. Two weeks after we found out she has the aggressive type. From here it was a short road to hell. Weekly chemotherapies, one time she is better, the week after acute blast crisis. I looked for every alternative therapy and got it to her, couldnt lose her so soon. Within two months she got worse, and one day she collapsed near me when she tried to stand still. I panicked and we rushed her to the hospital. At the hospital the doctor was talking about getting her a euthanasia. My brother and I begged crying for my parents not to do it yet. She got a blood transfusion and was released back home. It was 2 days before my 19th birthday . so I managed to convince my parents to wait with the euthanasia. At that time my parents accused me and her brother for being selfish, for letting her suffering. No need to mention it was the saddest birthday in my life seeing that my dog, who meant the whole world to me, collapses every time she tries to stand. The night after my birthday my parents found her laying the other side our yard. we couldnt understand how she got there considering she couldnt walk. We took her back inside understanding she might die that night. Apparently her running away happened one more time during that night. In the morning I woke up to the sounds of my mom screaming. My dog managed to escape again and this time got under some trees. She laid still with flies all around her. She wasnt dead but her tongue and ears were completely white, it was scary to look at. We cried and begged her to get out, she must have laid there for two more hours until we managed to. I was talking to her promising her we would get her a euthanasia if its her time to go, but I dont want her to die under that tree with all the flies. I was losing my mind that morning. But as if she understood me, after saying that to her she cooperated and we managed to get her out. Making my side of the promise we got her to the vet for a euthanasia, where I had to say my final goodbye. I didnt stay to see the actual dying, but my mom and brother did. I got back home and 30 minutes later I heard my brother and my mom returning crying. I was devastated but I knew we did everything we could. All of that happened in october 2020. Ever since then Ive been having a dream that reoccurs (last time- last night). It changes a bit from time to time but it always includes my dog being sick, me having to face all of it again, saying my final goodbye. Sometimes thoughts I was having at that time are being localized in the dream and I can hear sentences like how can you say a final goodbye to someone you love so much. In that dream I essentially re-live the last 2 days of her life- the rapid declining , the traumatic morning I detailed, and finally the actual death (which on real life I never got to see). The dreams are extremely realistic and I basically live through all of the emotions I had back then, and worse. No need to mention I always week up in terror, often crying. Does it sound like I have TSD? Why do I keep having this dream? What else does my brain want me to process that I didnt already? . Tld- a year and a half ago my dog was dying from cancer, the last days of her life were incredibly traumatic to me and Ive been having dreams about those final moments over and over again. Why is this happening to me? ",

Im from the type of family where its encouraged to be strong and suppress anything like that. But at the moment, I feel like I need help but I dont really know what for. I have all the symptoms which I feel like indicate to something being wrong but I second guess myself all the time and wonder if Im actually faking it somehow. I thought maybe if I wrote about some of my symptoms, maybe someone would be able to help. Ive struggled with low energy for at least a few years now, I just put it down to being lazy and maybe the birth control I was on. Another side effect that I put down to birth Control was complete lack of sex drive which has definitely put a strain on my relationship. But Im starting to think that its just my brain since Ive been off birth control for almost two months now. There are weeks when I really struggle with my appetite, its not necessarily a conscious decision but I just forget to eat or put it off. Sometimes my brain just seems to flip a switch and I get so overwhelmed by everything and I just have to dissociate by watching something mindless or sleeping. The littlest things (like chewing or someone sitting too close to me) can set me off and I just want to shut down. Again this can affect my relationship, I constantly feel like Im disappointing him despite him always being there to support me. I tend to isolate myself when feeling like this which just starts a cycle of me believing that people dont want me around. I struggle with motivating myself which can affect my university work. To top it off, I recently broke my kneecap which has vastly affected my usual social life of going out with friends. Im not sure if thats just pushed me to this post as Im sort of in a low point.

Im not often at parties and I know I can sometimes get overwhelmed by noise and people. But its always something Ive tried my best to handle. I was sitting down, while some of my friends were dancing, and I started pitching my fingers. Im not sure why, I just did (heard it was a grounding technique and I was feeling a little out of it) Then I continued for Im not sure how long but at least 5 minutes. I was perfectly aware of how weird I was looking, just moving from finger to finger and pitching them while staring at them, but I didnt stop. I got myself to stop, but I think I was still a little out of it, Im not sure. I went up and danced a bit with the others, but ended up stopping pretty quickly and going to my own room, just to decompress a bit and get my head together. Like the music was loud, and there were a lot of people close to me, so that was probably it. I sat down on my bed and immediately my eyes started crying. Dont ask me why. It was weird, and my hands started rubbing up and down my arms in this specific pattern - all the way up one arm, all the way down, rub my hands together, switch to the other arm, rub up and down, repeat. Which that whole deal went on for a while. I knew what I was doing and that I could stop, cause it was weird, but I didnt. Just, rub up and down, up and down for minutes on end. Now I have add, so I know about tico and I know about overstimulation, so maybe it was smoothing? But Im not used to my body just doing things on its own to that degree. And just, wtf was that? Why did I do that? Maybe I was just telling myself to do that and didnt realise, cause I could stop I just didnt want to, I did stop after a few minutes. I was perfectly aware of what I was doing. Does this sound familiar to you? I wasnt in a stressful situation and I like my dorm mates, so Im not sure wtf that was. ",

    "text": "Hi. I am 21 and male, and currently live in Voronezh, Russia. Before you say anything, I'll straight up say that while I don't have a real side chosen, I just want this war to end as fast as possible, no matter who wins. I've already been harassed en masse for this, no need to do it here. There. I said it. Also, please don't mind the grammar issues or sentences that sound weird, english isn't my first language. Now onto the main point. For the past 1 and a half months, everywhere, life has turned to the absolute rock-bottom worst for me. I've tried to make it better, but it failed every time. I live in my own apartment and give half of my salary to my parents because they are currently unable to work and get the money to pay their bills. 2 weeks from now, I will have to pay rent while barely getting enough to buy groceries. I don't know how it is for most of you in the west, but rent here is absurdly high. If something doesn't change, I will get kicked out and will have to move back to my apartment. Even then, the bills there are also very high and I feel we may not be able to pay those either in a while. One of the biggest factors that plunged me into this extremely bad state was the death of my only close friend who had the chance to go into reserves instead of active service, a few months ago. He was the only person I could really talk to and have fun with. He died after being shot in the neck and bleeding out. This has been the thing that really hit me the hardest in the past several weeks. I thought he'd come back fine and well after a few months passed after entering reserves. I have been trying to get something to make it all feel better, and succeeded at doing so, and got prescribed antidepressants, but after a week they stopped having any effect. The internet is my only real source of communication with people that arent coworkers who dont listen to me and dont give a shit about my personal life, and my parents. Nearly all the people that knew me have abandoned me, and I have been getting harassed nonstop, daily. I get about 40 private messages a day across multiple websites telling me that I, my family, my dead friend and all of my people deserve to get shot/burned/passed to death, and more obscene things. People have successfully found my address and posted it on the internet, saying they're gonna attempt to seat me soon. Even better, to just add the cherry on top to all of this, my cat, who has kept me company through my hard times for the past several years, died. What the fuck am I supposed to do at this point. I know more people are going to harass me even more because are and aren't the victim, the innocent dying in ukraine but I've heard enough by this point. I have a 9mm pistol that I keep for safety, but at this point I am completely ready to pull the trigger on myself. It gets worse day by day and it hasn gotten better. I just want to restart as a different person that is fortunate enough to not be born here, let alone be associated with my country as it seems people are becoming increasingly bloodthirsty towards us. I know I'm probably talking to a brick wall here because i've talked to some people and they just encourage me to pull the trigger, but i'll post anyway. Not like I have something to lose other than maybe my family's safety. Please give some advice. I don't know what to do anymore. ",

The songs name is am not the or something like that and it's about being different in many ways from the norm, mental health, sexual attraction, etc. I really liked it then, but today I felt like I lived it. I have had this feeling before. It is the feeling you get when people just don't seem to understand that we do not speak the same language. We are not the same. I have a person in my life who has their own issues but mostly we clash because we are very different. I try to think about this when I feel pronged by them. I try to think that we are just miscommunicating. I don't understand them and they don't understand me. But lately it's been harder. I feel like they speak to me as if they thought I was They know my issues pretty well at this point, they know I struggle. Yet, they put these high standards up for me and everyone else to live up to and sometimes it's just too much for me. I feel like such a failure in their eyes. It's just what everyone should do, they say. Like being this perfect person that behaves appropriate in every situation is somehow the bare minimum. Tomorrow is a hard day. We had a lot to do planned and now we have even more to do because someone said we should do another thing while we are already at it. I was too tired to say anything about it although I usually do. I just wanted to go to bed. And here I am. Regretting that I didn't stand up for myself and say I don't think I want to do I don't think I can do that. But now it's decided, apparently. I have been doing better at speaking up for myself lately but it feels like half of the times that I do, the other person comes with a decent counter argument and I just fold. Because what if I am wrong? What if my way hurts someone? What if my way costs too much? What if my way is actually ridiculous? What if they shake their head and look dissapointedly at me with judging eyes? . I am not the same. But it's hard to say those words when some people doesn't really believe that's enough for special treatment. Gh, how I hate that word. It should be adapted treatment. It's adapted to how I am. I am not special. I am just not the same. Thanks for reading. Goodnight. I hope I survive tomorrow. It's gonna be a nightmare. ",

    "text": "Main question still stands but I will leave this wall of text here as I am looking forward to some customized answers as well, if your time allows, fellow redditors. Maybe you have been through something similar and you have learnt how to deal with it step by step. When I was younger, ago, I used to be very outspoken but in that way I brought upon myself many enemies, among which bullies. I was bullied at such an extent that I was looking with fear to the next time I will meet my abusers, which was almost all the time as we frequented similar spots and my home town was small. At the same time, being the dumb kid that I was, I also made some mistakes and got to be from outspoken straight up rude, insulting people that I could call my then-friends to a grave extent. My own punishment that I brought on my self was refusing to make fun of people and talk behind their backs ever again. You might wonder, Allow me to explain myself - making fun of people for no apparent reason is inherently bad but at the same time, I was using this to establish boundaries in a way that is not overly dramatic. And of course, talking behind people's back is shit behaviour, but being the dedicated kid that I was if I will do something it will be all or nothing so that meant not venting at all - keeping it all in, not getting any advice from my peers regarding a behaviour from someone else upon myself, a nuance, nothing, nothing - which is one of the many fruits that communication bears. Another punishment that I deemed fit was my abusive relationship through which I went - that meant an insane amount of verbal abuse, gaslighting etc. won't get into details, everything in the cookbook. In the beginning, I was quite the warrior and I put up a good fight but this person seemed to be able to erode my personality bit by bit. By the end of it, my own self was diluted at such an extent that I cannot bear to fathom. I do not remember some things in the present either as I shut down, though I am fine nowadays, its been over 5 years and I moved on. But it was not easy - in the first 2-3 it was fairly difficult to reintegrate in society - being labeled as aggressive, passive aggressive or antisocial. While trying out different integration tactics, at my first office job ( which looking back, was kind of toxic as well ) I was used by my colleagues for different favours such as venting or cigarettes, felt looked down upon simply through the dismissive looks my colleagues were throwing each other ( which they did not seem to hide after one point in time ), I had no self respect or self confidence in the work that I was delivering ( even though, I was doing actually a pretty good job ). My relationship with my parents was never good in teenage hood. I always had my mother downplay on me standing up for myself. I communicated to her that I do not like it, approximately a year ago and that was the start of lettering our relationship, however it had a long way to go, with her continuously trying to put situational conflicts on me being the culprit e. g. I would come to tell her a story with me and person X, in which person X was completely rude, moment in which her first reaction would be, did X see you have some ( in lack of better words ) facial expressions? Probably it might not be a clear example for some of you, but what I mean is: her approach is instead of pushing your own goddamn child to stand up for oneself you hope your child was not reactive to an obvious insult - which you should be. Now, needless to say I am in a situation where I cannot deal with confrontation, out of fear of being too aggressive, dramatic, out of touch with reality etc. That varies by nuances, maybe a jokingly said you without an established ground to aggressiveness, passive agressiveness, crossing my own boundaries etc. My humour used to save me with putting people in their place though I haven't practiced it in a long time because of that stupid I brought on myself, failing to realize it was a gift rather than a curse and when having a strong personality, of course you're going to turn some heads. I feel like throughout my life, over and over again, other people have built their self esteem on my back and I was aware of it, letting it happen. I feel like I have to cut sharp like a razor blade when people start slowly crossing boundaries because it is easier sooner rather than later. That is out of fear of getting in the situation previously mentioned - because others had no limits of being whatsoever. At the same time, that is a mismatch with my easy-going, fun, joking-type of person. TLDR: So, how do you deal with confrontation? do you have examples or you use? ",

She says she has lost all her motivation, and she's been saying that for at least 5 years. She has social anxiety and constantly has panic attacks. She can't even go buy something from the shops without needing one of us to stay on the call with her. She is looking at me for help because she sees me as an idol or something similar. And I can understand why, I have got my life sorted out and have managed to deal with my own social anxiety. But annoyingly, the tactics that I used on my self. Doesn't work on her. When I was dealing with it, I would try to fully convince my self and control my emotions to realise how dumb my anxieties were. This was a combination of pressuring myself into making embarrassing moments and finding ways to get through the negative side effects of it ( not extremely embarrassing moments). She has made near to no progress in helping her mental health and we ( my family) think it's because she isn't trying to help herself. I don't think that's true but I don't have any evidence of her doing so. ( we haven't told her what we truly think of her situation we just support). Whenever she does call, we do pick herself up. Personally I say to her that if one way doesn't work, then you have to try another. Id if that's working. She wants to be a travel person ( im tired I can't think of the real name rn) which is a great start. But she doesn't have any hobbies (apart from gaming but she doesn't see that as a hobby and more as procrastination).

I didn't have any major depressive episodes in 2 years and my anxiety was getting better. That was partly due to a friend I made. He helped me a lot and I am grateful for his help. I think I wouldn't have been here if I hadn't met him. For the past 14 days, I have been depressed and anxious and I think he has had enough of me. I am going to university and working at the same time. I also have some other activities and the stress of everything probably got to me.

And when I look at how much I have to do I just start crying because on top of that I should be prepping for the college entry exam but I obviously don't have time for that now or any time soon and the entry exam is like in twoish months. I don't know how to get out of this circle of being overwhelmed with everything and what I should do to be able to mentally withstand this. ",

    "text": "Hi all. I (24F) got heavily bullied by my classmates throughout both primary and secondary school. I changed schools frequently (within the same town, my family moved within the same neighbourhood, it was purely about being bullied) because I simply couldn't take more crap from my peers. Classmates and their friends attending the same school gave me super hard time and I was in a very bad place up until university. I have recently reconnected with a classmate that wasn't all that bad (compared to the others) and I found out her boyfriend is another classmate that I actively avoid, because he was one of my worst bullies. He's now a successful musician, advocates for mental health and wellbeing, and generally acts like a good person- but I can't shake the person I saw. I've been in therapy for 6 years now, I gained experiences, memories and friends that could overcome all the bad shit I went through- but no matter how hard I work on it, how hard I try to forgive them (despite never getting a sincere apology), the bad keeps coming back like a needy corpse. I attended university abroad, got a Master's from one of top Up universities, and I still don't know how to move on from people that bullied me. How to put them past me and not allow them to shape my life anymore- for instance, I walked into a caf to meet with a good friend, but the guy mentioned above was there as well. Our eyes met and I froze- I couldn't stay there. I avoid places my bullies go I changed everything about my appearance to avoid being recognised. How do I go on? I'm genuinely exhausted. thank you for reading this. ",

At one point they were gonna get divorced. Things are a OT better now but I . My mom would get angry at me because I would keep idolizing dad, not really knowing the context of their relationship before I was born. She would keep talking about having me live with dad if I loved him so much and stuff. I remember getting scared that she would run away and leave. She never did and I don't remember if she ever said she would but I was pretty young at the time. At one point she got so angry she streamed about how she hated the family. I was alone in the house with her and I think that was the first time she got angry around me. So, mom and dad lived separate albeit not totally divorced. And while things were usually fine, I think there were at least 4 or 5 occasions where she mentioned or had me go to live with dad. Until she calmed down and told me she didn't mean it. I remember she said it to me once and I wanted to roll my eyes because she never actually went through with it for long. Skip a couple years and I'm as emotionally aware as a brick so I'm expressing went up anger by lasting out while thinking there isn't a problem.

    "text": "This is a long story, so Im sorry in advance. I hope your day is going really well so far 3 (and if it is, you might want to click away, this post is kind of a summer haha! ). I dont know if it matters at all that Ive been diagnosed with depression and multiple anxiety disorders in the past, but Ill put it out there just in case it can give any extra input or even an explanation to whatever this weird phase is that Im going through. Anyway. Ive always been very insecure about the way that I look. Last year, there was a period of time where it was bad enough that I started to count my calories very strictly. At first I allowed myself 800 a day, then it felt like too much, so I went down to 500 a day, then I felt guilty about those 500 as well, so I just stopped eating all together. I had managed to eventually push myself out of that bad place, and started eating again. The main reason was that I stopped caring about weight, and adopted the mindset of well, eventually we all die anyway, and it doesnt really matter. (an important detail for the present-day-issues). It felt unnecessary to suffer, so I started to eat again. A few months on I was almost completely back to normal, and would eat without even thinking about it. Its been almost a year I think? Probably less. A couple of weeks ago, I spiraled back into it. This time its worse. At first I allowed myself 500 a day, then quickly found I feel extremely guilty for the little I do let myself eat, and stopped eating again. Whenever I do eat, whether its because my family starts to suspect or because I give in to the hunger, I feel like I have to make up for it by not eating a thing the next couple of days. I think the problem is that its not just about weight. Ive been caring less and less about my weight the past few days, and the same thoughts of it doesnt really matter in the long run have been back, but I still want to starve. Some days Im kind of okay with my current weight, but despite that, the thought of eating terrified me and if I do eat I feel extremely guilty afterwards. I find myself less anxious when my stomach feels empty or when I exercise on an empty stomach. Im afraid that I just want to starve. Despite knowing that in the long run, starvation is actually counterproductive for weight loss, I keep looking for excuses to do it anyway. Ive been searching through so many articles for one to tell me that the body survival mode doesnt exist and that I actually will lose weight starving. I feel like even if somehow my body magically started losing weight the more I eat, Id still want to starve. Its like some days it really is about losing weight, and others I just want to know that I havent eaten today. The thing that bothers me the most is that I really dont want to get better. I dont want to find a reason to stop feeling this way or to eat normally. Im really scared of people finding out. Enough to even bring up food myself, like, I cant wait to eat when I get home or wow I ate so much today, I feel awesome. Ive been hiding it from my friends and family partly because Im really embarrassed about it, but mostly because I dont want to burden them. Ive been avoiding my friend group because we often snack together, and I find it ten times harder to resist food when Im with them. I hate saying Im not hungry because Im scared theyll catch on, so when Im with them I always end up eating and then beating myself up for it afterwards. Im the therapist/mum friend in the group, and I guess theyre used to seeing me as someone they turn to with their own mental struggles, so I kind of have this persona of the friend who has her life put together and always looks on the bright side and always knows what to say and always has the answer to everything and always has a bandaid at the ready and anything they need. I hate looking vulnerable in front of them. They probably wouldnt have believed it if someone told them of the mental illnesses Ive been dealing with for years. Which leads me to the next point - I dont think I have an eating disorder. Last year when I was going through a similar thing, it stopped on its own in just a few months without ever having to tell my parents. I think Ive just been going through a really weird phase. Im just bothered by how terrified I am of the thought of getting out of it. Its really hard to explain, but it makes me feel this weird type of importer syndrome, like Im trying to suffer just so I can feel bad for myself, because since weight isnt as scary to me as it used to be, why do I still starve? Do I subconsciously think its cool or something? Dont people who suffer from stuff like that, want to get better? If I dont, does that mean Im faking it so I can feel bad for myself? Yeah, its a really ugly feeling. Well, thank God for strangers on the internet. Thank you so much if you read this thing, there was literally no one holding a gun to your head but you did it anyway, haha. I dont think Im looking for an answer, as again - I dont really want to get better. I think I just wanted to vent. Its been a little heavy. I hope you have a really, truly good day. 3. p. s - not sure how to flair this because it started with me looking for an opinion and spiraled into a massive vent. sorry, haha. ",

He broke countless things that were meaningful to me out of anger. Furthermore, I had found a text message from his college who he had written, next time I'm over maybe we can take a dip in your hotub after we Needless to say, we have been divorced for a few years. When I left I didn't have children and I had a mother who allowed me to move back in with her. I had just started my By degree in psychology to pursue my MA in Counseling (MF/CC). When I left people would say I'm so My response was always the same, it's okay, I feel liberated like I can breathe I also had a loving sister who reached deep into that abyss to pull me out and encourage me to get help. It took many times of feeling helpless, uncontrollable crying, shaking in fear, unstoppable worry, and belief in myself to move on. What we had was undeniably the most incredible love I had ever felt. In fact, most people that saw us could tell from a distance that we were inseparable. I oftentimes find myself thinking about what went wrong. What I am about to tell you is out of experience, not hearsay. After about 2 years of being married, he stopped going to church with me. He started to question if God was even real. He questioned everything he was raised on and the holy spirit. Once he stopped attending church for a while, I asked if he'd like to attend somewhere else. We did go to a larger church for a while, but he didn't connect the way he should have with the men in the church. He continued to carry the weight of his issues on his own shoulders, instead of on God. He blamed the pastors of multiple churches for being controlling and manipulative, which in fact was his detriment. Let's catch up to 2022. Tell me it isn't a coincidence that he has now married a new woman. This is his third marriage. I found out yesterday that he and his wife are talking about splitting up. He's not happy. No fu Sarah surprise to me! I knew he would never be happy with another person, he's not happy with himself. He complains that she is not as affectionate as he'd like. I have been dating a guy for three years, who will never marry me. Really I just believe that he's not meant to marry. We are breaking up soon. We have talked about it multiple times. I am just waiting for the right time. He will move out and I will have my own apartment for the first time in my life at the age of 35. I graduate in 7 weeks with my Master's in Marriage Family Therapy and Professional Clinical Counseling. I lead an amazing worship group and I have amazing supports and individuals in my life who bring happiness and joy to me daily. I had an encounter yesterday with the most amazing guy. He had the most beautiful spirit of love. I could see it in his eyes and could feel it as he walked me to my car. He loved people just like me. God told me that someone like him was waiting for me. He was preparing my husband who will love me in all my flaws and insecurities. In fact, he will see the beauty in them. It will be a Godsy man who has the same spirit of serving people. In God's timing, he will come to me, in God's timing. ",

I've struggled with that all my life. But i've been trying the online dating route to meet women (or men, really) since its harder for me to go places like bars and clubs where ppl normally meet (i have a significant mobility impairment). I'll start talking with someone, the conversation will click pretty well, then they ask the dreaded question: let's exchange pics. Well, at that point i figure might as well even though i have a pretty good idea of the outcome after so many tries:. They block me. Or just stop talking to me. Every time. Every. Fucking. Time. I would kill to hear a you're or even (which feels more like something a mom would say then a romantic interest) but note. Only a deafening, agonizing silence. As for the sites/apps where your pic is the first thing they see, i never get any matches or likes or messages to begin with and all mine go unanswered. In the case of me sending the pics upon their request, it clearly isn't a personality issue, since we'll have been talking quite well up to that point. It's all the face. Are so many people really that shallow? If so, what hope is there for a hideous beast clearly barely resembling a human, like me? Or am I just objectively unattractive and unappealing to anyone? I want to keep trying because that's just my natural spirit and attitude about challenges, but this is really starting to hurt. Its almost a tangible physical sensation now, the rejection. I find myself feeling worse about myself with each failed attempt. And of course, when your confidence is gone you're even LES appealing to anyone, especially women. So I'm just digging myself a hole by trying this method but id what else to do to try and rectify my loneliness and isolated feeling. In person isn't much better, since i have visibly low confidence, am apparently quite unattractive, and disabled (yes i feel like that makes a difference to people. in fact i know it does, from experience). Fuck me, I don't even have any platonic friends. I have three people who would say they are, but we never hardly talk let alone go do stuff, so its like they arent even in my life anyway. How does a person deal with this? It makes me so sad, and i don't want to get into the self-pity mindset since that's also toxic, but i feel like im getting there whether i want to or not. Thanks for reading this far. ",

I've had a therapist my whole life and have been in and out of treatment centers and have tried many medications throughout my life. I'm 24 for reference. I was originally on:. 20 mg Prozac once a day. Buscar 2x a day . 10 mg of Adderall once a day (my psychiatrist is also involved in rehab and although I'm not an abuser, is meaning me off of Adderall and wants to try something else which is fine. ). 50 mg of hydroxyzine three times a day or as needed (usually take one before bed or when I feel a panic attack coming on). Now I'm taking:. 40 mg Prozac once a day. Buscar 3x daily. Taking Adderall later in the day (same dosage). And she's working on getting me to start taking the hydroxyzine more often. Just with the Buscar dosage being increased, I've started experiencing sleep paralysis and night errors again. They're so bad that I cry in my sleep and think I'm still in my dream when I wake up. Luckily I have my boyfriend who supports me and calls me when these happen. When I first started taking the new mens, I started experiencing sleep paralysis and nightmares again. (I hadn't dealt with sleep paralysis and vivid night errors since I was like 14-16 years old) then they seemed to ware off, which is why I forgot to mention it at my last appointment. Now they're starting up again (it lasted for a while last time) and it's the weekend, so I can't really call anyone. Plus, my psychiatrist is going on vacation. It has got to be the absolute scariest thing to happen when asleep. ",

    "text": ". When I was first diagnosed with schizophrenia I thought that my life was over. It felt like I'd been punched in the stomach many times and left to fend for myself. The world was already a scary place, it felt scarier and more dangerous as I had to fight an enemy that was within me. Imagine waking up one day in a psychiatric hospital and hearing every single one of your thoughts whispered in your ears. Having an invisible presence exposing everything you were thinking in real-time. Thinking that every person you met had access to your deepest secrets. your private thoughts. Like your skull had cracked open and that there was nothing you could do to stop the thoughts from pouring out. That's exactly where I found myself in 2008, aged 22. I had dreams, hopes, and goals and they had all been shattered by five words: think. you have . I thought to myself, I'm not even sure I understood what that meant. I'd heard about those people on To. Were't they the murderous ones? the criminal ones? those without any future? What did that have to do with me? . Fast forward to today I'm a happily married mother of one, living in the North of England. A proud cosmopolitan woman who's been to hell and back. I'm here to say that you too can make it to the other side. I've found my balance through trial and error and I believe that some people might benefit from my experience. It won't be easy, you'll have to face a lot of adversity, there will be friends and family members you'll have to let go of. You'll have to confront the monsters of your past and slay them. They will still be there taunting you many years later - but you'll have grown to see them as shadows, distant traces in your memory that no longer have power over you. The first step is the hardest. You have to accept that there's a problem. You wouldn't be where you are if there wasn't one. You're not there by chance. I don't think there's a magic formula for acceptance, a one-size-fits-all solution. What worked for me won't necessarily work for you. What I found helpful in my case was asking questions. There were many negative thoughts going against me, leading me to believe there had been a mistake, but I had to rely on hard facts. Questions Why am I here? What is this place? How do people end up here? Who treats people here? Can you end up here by mistake? If so how do I get out? How do they let people out? All these questions led me to think at first that something was obviously wrong but not so wrong that the whole world had gone mad. That was a fact, then if I'd been sectionid by mistake, I needed to prove it to my Needless to say, I didn't succeed. It would take about 3 years for me to realize that I had indeed gone . Those 3 years would be hell for my mother and my stepfather whose mission was to keep me alive at all costs. There would be sane times with welcome breaks for them where there was some semblance of formality. These peaceful moments were achieved through medication and weekly visits to my psychiatrist. Medication that had to be injected intravenously, until I agreed to take oral medication in exchange for my freedom. The constant surveillance only emphasized my symptoms but I was too to realize it. In my case, medication has been generally effective and beneficial. However, I must say that I've had to pay a price for that. I went from 60kgs to over 100kgs in about 2-3 years after becoming a fully compliant patient in 2011. Some might say that's not so bad, but the consequences to my self-esteem, mental health, and health in general, have been severe. The doses and brands of mens I've taken have changed more than I care to remember. Today, a small dose of antipsychotic and 1 or 2 anti-depressants keep me stable. Living day to day is also important. When you are fighting a health crisis like this, the most care should be given to how you spend your days. There really isn't space for anything else, it's all about surviving each day and making it to the next. This might seem sad but simplifying your existence will help you to spend less time in your head. The less time you spend in your head the better. This emphasis on daily living can be called mindfulness, minimalist, or simple living. I'm really grateful for that time because it helped me to see what mattered the most in life. Things like friends, family and helping others. I realized that I had been spending my life on unproductive things that led nowhere. I started to read again, and bought second-hand books on spirituality, self-help and health. This gave me space between what I was going through and my daily life. I got a full-time job that didn't require me to think, paid off my debts and started to feel at peace. That peace slowly progressed into acceptance, from there to contentment and finally to hope. Progress had been made. Another thing that has been really helpful is therapy. I didn't get access to psychotherapy until I was well into my mental health recovery. The second psychiatrist also had a bunch of them), that treated me for about 3 years believed that I would really benefit from one. The first therapist I saw was very good but she didn't have many availabilities. The second therapist I consulted was paid for by the government and was too young. She must have been a bit older than I was at the time say early thirties) and always asked me the same questions. In the same monotone voice. And just didn't seem to care that much. I skipped so many sessions with her that they took me off her list. Years later, having moved in with my would-be husband and benefiting from his private insurance, I found a therapist online that would help me to see my blind spots, give me a better understanding of my past, and challenge me to see things that I had overlooked. The psychiatrist was right, therapy was really key. I could only afford 8 sessions, but those sessions were pivotal. They didn't revolutionized my life, they even made me feel a bit low afterwards. Indeed, I had to confront traumatic events from my childhood. That affected the way I perceived the world and interacted within it. It gave me a greater understanding of love, and compassion for the child I'd and respect, admiration and pride for myself for making it through all this. With everything that happened, something that really kept me going was the conviction that I hadn't gone through all that for nothing. I still had ambition but I had to break down my goals to make them more realistic and achievable. It took consistent and daily steps to get here. I still have bad days and times when I just need to be left alone, dark times when I ruminate all day long - but I'm still here. Tips and Reminders for your epic journey. It might take you more time or you may get through it faster than I did. Everyone's journey is different, remember to be kind to yourself. Go at your own pace. If you don't believe you can make it, read and learn from others. Your situation may be unique to you, but there are millions of us that have been through the same thing. There will be setbacks, be prepared for a journey that will not be smooth sailing. You will be challenged but you can make it. Do not believe in miracle solutions that claim that you can be cured. It doesn't work that way. Do not believe it! . Recovery isn't life as it was. Recovery is a new way of living, thinking, and being. Ask for help when in doubt, when you're feeling down, or when you think there's no way out. Be willing to be vulnerable, most of the time it will be welcomed. People will listen to you, even share their experiences with you. Take-away. On this journey self-compassion is a requirement, there will be many ups and downs. Times when you want to quit, give up, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. There isn't a miracle solution, this is what worked for me. I hope you'll find what works for you or your loved one and that my post helps. You can find me on Twitter where I post about mindset, self-development, and spirituality in the context of mental health. My Twitter handle is I hope to hear from you soon. ",

    "text": "So a little over a month ago i was feeling perfectly fine didnt have any issues with anything it all just felt normal. About a month ago I started feeling anxious and always had the thought that i was going to die soon. Dont know why or how but it wasnt that bad so i didnt pay attention to it. I was regular smoker () And used to smoke everyday constantly. My boyfriend went on a work trip and i was home alone. One regular day i smoked, got a few things done got ready for bed, laid down and was just scrolling through my phone it was around 2 am, out of no where i started feeling anxious and suddenly i was shaking uncontrollable, I got really scared and woke up my roommate to see if he could take me to the En, but for some reason i was paranoid to go in so i stayed in the car until the shaking was a little more tolerable. My roommate drove us back home that night i showered forced myself to throw up and went to sleep all though i was really scared. The next day i woke up and everything felt different, felt disconnected from reality, i started looking up online what could be wrong with me and it was all just breaking me out so i put my phone away, I asked my mom to pick me up bc i didnt want to stay alone. When i got in the car Noise were breaking me out everything was extremely loud and making me very anxious. I just cried the whole car ride and after that i decided i didnt want to to leave from being in a safe space which is my house or my moms house, i would feel scared and anxious randomly and since i felt so disconnected from reality i would just force myself to sleep. it lasted for a good week, My boyfriend came back and we went back to my house, I feel like its going away because at least now i can go on car rides, but every time i try go back to work or even if i go out to eat for example, i freak out and become anxious my heart beats fast, and hearing people talk loudly bothers me. I dont know what wrong with me but i want to get better, ALS please dont say anything that might scare me just suggest what i could do to improve, I dont have a therapist, ive never had one. Ive always been what i guess is considered a lazy person because i never had much energy to do much. but i just want to get better, i need to go back to work and i want to be normal again. ",

During this time I have started to notice how she can get very aggressive especially when she is drunk, first I thought she was just one of those people who have a really bad type of drunk but after a while I realized that it was more then that. What would happen is that she would still be able to act relatively normal and friendly towards everyone else however to me she would become a total bitch for no reason this led to some fights that I know she didn't really intend to happen. Her mother has diagnosed borderline so my girlfriend often joked about it how she probably had it too but recently it really hit her and me as well how likely this is and also how serious it is. More and more it would happen that she had absolutely no control over her emotions and this added so much stress to our relationship. Two days ago she told me she couldn't take it anymore, the way she was hurting me with her actions and our relationship as a whole. She didn't dare to say it but it was clear she needed some time on her own to figure things out. Right now we don't really talk and I hope she has some headspace to figure herself out. I don't want this to be the end for us but also I don't want to hold onto something that will inevitably fail to make us happy. Are there any people here with borderline or people in general who have some advice? I would really appreciate anyone's efforts. ",

Its hard because my husband just holds me and says till be okay and tracks my breathing but then as I calm down I say Im sorry and it comes back and I cant stop crying.

Im a 17 year old male and I would say im an extreme introvert but its a weird position, im the leader of the school debate team and constantly do public speaking in or outside of school. I only have around 3 close friends (these guys are like literal brothers to me) but a lot of people know me and im on good terms with most people. Its just that once it gets off topic from work or whatever im debating about im silent as hell, people are often surprised if they havent see me debate before cause outside of that im easily the quietest person in the room with most of the times me saying nothing outside of work/class and if you think me talking personally to guys was bad, then to girls is horrible somehow its easier for me to speak to a 400 people audience then 1 girl. Now why i posted this is likely cause, ive never been in a relationship and i think relationship loneliness (if thats the right term) is what i feel and it just consumes me for the entire day for some reason, it feels as if its not just a mental thing but like a tangible object inside me (if that makes any sense) . I used to talk to a girl id known for 5 years and i got to like her but i got rejected, there is a girl i have some feelings for right now but shes got a boyfriend. My friends and that first girl have unironically told me that ive got good looks and a great personality if a person is able to break my shell enough to really get to know me.

    "text": "Im reading Practical Mysticism by Evelyn Underhill, a great book about how the spiritual life is open to everyone, not just the Which That Hands of this world. One of the key ideas in the book is the idea that what mystics, poets, saints and artists and others with vision have access to is not the supernatural, but union with reality. They see the interconnected and miraculous in the everyday and they attempt through writing and art to make that available to us. The obvious question that begs then, if these people with vision are in touch with real, unfiltered reality, what is it then that were experiencing? Its a bit of a scary thought but its obvious when you break it down. We all have model in our head for how the world works. This model simplifies and distort it emphasises some things and deprioritises others. Its full of constructions and labels and judgements and assumptions that come from a lifetime of experience, our culture, our technology, our ideas. What youre experiencing isnt true reality - its what your mind shows you of the real world. There a very good reason why our mind sits in the way and presents us with its filtered version of reality. It comes back to the purpose of the mind, which is to keep you alive and safe. Your mind is a bit like a parent saying, out for this, dont forget about constantly worrying about us and making us worry in the process. In the same way that we dont need to have our parents around us our entire lives, we can also get our mind to stand down, take a chill pill and relax. But like your mum, it needs some convincing to let go. The first step is realise, accept and look deeply into the model of reality that your mind is putting in front of you. This version has hugely emphasised the dangers, risks and potential catastrophe that could befall you and ignores the beauty of the world most of the time. Evelyn Underhill described it as being inside a house with dirty windows but believing that youre outside. See the model your mind has created, smile to the model. Smile to your mind. Your mind is still your friend. Another critical step is to build your daily meditation practice. The only way to touch reality is to glue your awareness back together again and you cant do this without a strong practice. Set your regular time each day for practice and stick to it, even if you dont feel like doing it. If you cant do twenty mins, do ten minutes. If you cant do any formal practice, work it into your day. Do some walking meditation from your house to your car. Its also really important to make fundamental changes to simplify your life to give you the space and time to touch reality. If your job has you working all hours and stressed out, it might be time for a career change - nothing is more important than your wellbeing and peace. Even if a job pays well, even if youre in a position of respect and power - what's the point if it costs your mental health. Future happiness doesnt exist, you can only be happy in the present moment. Let go of working towards a future, simplify your current life so you can enjoy being alive now. And finally, a practice that is critical for getting in touch with reality is spending time around nature. That's why we have pets and houseplants, theyre so good for our mental health. But you can also go out and spend time in nature, spend hours just breathing and noticing things - the shape of clouds, the colour of leaves, the texture of bark, the iridescent wings of a magpie. Stop and see how much you can notice every time youre in nature of any kind. It will reduce your stress and help ground you in the here and now. Your mind is like a limpet, completely attached to the reality it has created which youve lived in your whole life, so dont rush the process, give yourself time to expand your awareness. But by seeing this construction for what it is you can start the journey of releasing it and living empty as NH describes - devoid of any assumptions, labels or attachments. ",

It's almost an automatic response for the thought. This behavior is something I've noticed in serial killers (ofc I have the sense to not act and I will clarify this) and other highly unstable men have the reaction, laughing at highly disturbing thoughts. How do I tackle them? I journal, somehow writing it all down makes me forgive it. My biggest fear is that I will never reach a point where I do not need the journal for this but as of right now my journal is highly disturbing and ends with sense, I hold values like love, adoration, care, and hard work very dear to me but I believe that childhood trauma (Please do not pity my circumstance, I am grateful for it) makes my subconscious very wild and even though on the surface I understand these values, I want to know a method better than journaling (I will continue it) to implement my values to my subconscious.

    "text": ". Ever since I hit puberty, porn has been my biggest enemy. Before puberty, I never had an interest in porn and had always felt disgusted by it, until I hit puberty and porn started interesting me. Overtime, I'd become aroused from what I see and it created this addiction in my head. However, instead of sitting and watching porn and mapping all day, I decided to have some activities in order to distract me such as going to the gym, after school activities, and expanding my social circle. Although these activities had helped me minimize my addiction, I still find ways to relapse and get addicted again. There were times when I had abstained from porn or masturbation for like a week or a month or two, but whenever I relapse I start doing it all over and over again and can't seem to stop. My last streak was from September till December. It wasn't really considered a as I had done it here and there, but I managed to keep it to a minimum and it had gave me some benefits. I started seeing more gains at the gym and started expanding my social circle. Although the streak is gone now and it has been gone for months, I still manage to see more gains at the gym and get stronger and I'm feeling mentally alright overall, despite the past couple of weeks seeming mentally tough for me. I still manage to go a week without doing it but I always tend to fall into that trap and I always feel like a failure whenever I masturbate. So therefore, my confidence goes down and I start to lose faith in myself. Although I still workout and do activities that distract me from doing this habit, I still find a way to do it and relapse. Therefore, for the month of April, I'm willing to abstain for the entire month and maybe even more, hoping that I'd stop doing it for good. Even if I fail to stop doing it for good at least I'd manage to stop for a decent amount of time. Hope it'd be a success, though. ",

    "text": "So, I guess that I'm asking to people who underwent horrible stuff that they could not do anything about like a disease to help me cope with the fact that my now ex-boyfriend and my dad totally abandoned me while being sick. I have endometriosis, and it spoiled my life, but from last year onwards pain became much more frequent and unbearable. I spent half of my year going from doctors to doctors to get them to give me some relief. During this time, I was not working on Ph, not working on my future career, not enjoying life, not doing sports, anything. It feels like so much time wasted. In the last six months, I took up the bed for like half a month every month. It was awful. After having marked everywhere, I FINALLY got the green light for a surgery that would suppress most of my symptoms. it's happening in four days: a hysterectomy. Thing is, I've been living for ten years with my boyfriend. Always thought we were a strong couple. Always helping out the other. Until something as big as that came, of course. And he. left me. In December. Saying my pain was too much, my shitty family was too much. He loved me, but that wasn't enough to stay. Would he have died, staying by my side? fuck no. But yet, it was too for him. I just wanted him on my sides, looking after me sometimes, sharing the burden, at least emotionally. But no. he left, and accused me of many things to feel about him leaving: my lack of libido (with a fucking endometriosis, yeah, sorry), my lack of attention towards his problems I always had so (namely, my family, disabled brother and toxic parents). He, on the other side, comes from a wealthy and kind family, where his parents would IE for him. I don't have that luck. Because in my own family, I can't rely on my mom: she does some suicide blackmail if I don't call her everyday, listening to her whining. She NEVER apologized for anything and just keeps on putting her burden on me. My dad is better, but still very aggressive and always transfers his bad emotions on me. Something goes wrong? I'll get a fucking sold for nothing, aggressiveness and all. Something goes right? I'll get a smile, and if I'm lucky, a little compliment. You know. Crumb. Endgame: my dad hosted me for a month, and then I had to leave to the fucking hotel because he was aggressive and treating me names everyday I couldn't bear the mental abusiveness, I left. On my own. I will have the surgery in FOUR days and none of my dad and boyfriend will be there. I feel so alone, all the time. Missing my boy like crazy despite his behavior. Still love him, of course. I guess my question is: how do you deal with being abandoned, once again? with a super important surgery ahead? sometimes I wish that the surgery goes wrong and that I die, right there. I know this surgery will be good for my future, but I have so much anger and frustration inside. I don't understand how they can leave me like that. I'm their fucking daughter and ex-nine years girlfriend, but who said it mattered? . I want to stop being enraged like that but anger is all I have. Anger, anger, anger. Sadness. For people who have been abandone Tongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry . how did you do? Yes, gathered your shit together, but aside from that? mentally? . my ex-boyfriend of nine years and my dad left me homeless and emotionally unstable a month before major surgery. how do I stop being angry/move forward?

    "text": "I'm struggling to find what I'm suffering from mentally. I should go to a doctor or get some therapy but, I don't have any amount of money for all of that. Also, I'm living in a household where talking about things like depression, anxiety and mental health will cause unnecessary dramas. Note : This is going to be a long post. Please take your time to read it. I wanted to know what I might be suffering from. Ever since I was a kid, I used to be very hyperactive. My childhood wasn't the best I must say. I'm a victim of domestic violence. I don't even wanna look back to miss the old days. My anxiety issues started building up at quite an early age. I was forced to adjust and fit in according to the needs of my parents. Kind of like a scapegoat. I'm now the least successful child in the family right now. I was never able to fit into the normal circle of people. I was very hyperactive, used to overreact (not intentional) used to be very expressive. I was never liked by anybody and have always felt like an outcast to the society. I could make a lot of friends in school, but most of them would end up not liking me due to my personality. I have had frequent ups and downs emotionally, some days I felt really related just to be a part of this world, while other days I wished that I was never born in the first place. I feel like people (ex : friends) trigger some kind of a trauma in me. Whenever I see a group of friends laughing or being happy in general, I feel really bad. Everytime I see a happy and loving family, I pity myself. Why wasn't I born in a healthy and loving family? It hurts to see people having those things in life, which I never had. My life was never peaceful or joyful. Spent most of my school days gaming on the Xbox. Now, I'm just an emotionally dead creature. I have no respect for myself. I don't even have the energy to hold half decent conversations with the people I meet. In college,I have had a similar experience with my friends. I was abnormal with my behaviour, but I couldn't help it. I didn't know that it made people get away from me. Now, I push people away. Something in me tells me that they aren't gonna hang around me after a while. I have ditched a good amount of opportunities where I could have made some decent contacts. I'm just a heap of mess. I'm growing out to be very paranoid. I can't trust anybody. I have stopped believing in things like love, relationships, and marriages. My anxiety always makes me think of the absolutely worst situations. It has made me mentally prepare to die a lonely, slow and painful death with no one to take care of me. I have planned to take the loneliest path. I hate talking to people and making friends. I'm also beginning to lose track of time. I have been missing out on multiple assignments for months! I still have a lot of pending work even now. All of my friends are worried about their future, they are able to work on whatever is needed to move ahead. I'm struggling to study thoroughly. I FEE TIRED. I don't even have the energy to think about my future, I just wait for the day to end. I feel like killing myself everyday. Nobody's supportive. Being the eldest son in a middle class family is the biggest curse. From what I have seen on YouTube, I feel like I roughly have ADHD, TSD and I either have BD or I'm Bipolar. Am I really depressed? Or, am I just lazy? . If I'm mentally ill, what all disorders/conditions am I possibly suffering from? . How can I cope with it as I cannot afford therapy or treatments and I can't even afford to go to a gym? ",

I still debate it because doing the same thing at different times CAN create different results, but that's neither here nor there. Sometimes we get stuck in logical loops and we end up repeating the same process over and over. The drive that keeps us from it is what I'm calling the Meta-Drive. It isn't a new concept, but I can't remember where I got it so I had to create a temporary name. This is the idea or mindware that allows us to take a or overarching view of our actions and results from those actions to help us realize when we're stuck in a loop or taking actions that are overall harmful for us. If our brains are organic computers, then they would have necessarily evolved beyond being stuck in a loop. The most apparent solution is this or to look at our lives in a simplified overview or view that leads us to the most efficient tactic available. The reason I point this out is because simple awareness of a process in our minds makes it that much more powerful and moves it into the semi-conscious realm like breathing or linking (which you are probably now thinking about).

Im unsure whether they will ever get better as they never seem to help themselves. They often call telling my they are trying to kill themselves and and any conversation day or night that doesnt start that way will still typically end like it (have heard them say theyre going to die probably 100 times now which affects me every time I hear it) 2 years ago they went to rehab but checked themselves out early, and this year they received a dui and house arrest. They also lie and manipulate me often to the point where I dont know what to believe any more (telling me theyre in hospital/dying when theyre not and hiding when I come over to check, telling me I dont love/see them even though I tell them I love them often and they cancel plans often). Family (theyre siblings) have primarily helped them to get better but have also distanced themselves slightly. Even this morning they called to tell me they have liver failure (not sure if I believe) and that this is the last time youre going to speak to me, Im ending it where I had to hang up. They were there for me always when growing up and these last 5 years have been extremely hard to see. Im 21 now and feel like I should be helping but dont know how I would genuinely help.

In january I ended my toxic relationship, I met up with an old friend (22F) and somehow I cant decide if shes interested in me or not, and if im interested in her or not. I also started going to the gym again. I felt good for maybe a month, but now im back in my pit again. (I live in Hungary, maybe being close to Ukraine and Russia also doesnt help much) I feel overwhelmed and i feel like im going to break because of really high work expectations, money issues, my body image, that confusing friendship with the girl. Today i almost cried in the gym toilet. I want to escape everything but i cant. I have 2 people i could talk to, but I dont want to. For some reason, I feel safer and more comfortable posting this here, than telling it to my 2 friends whose been with me for more than 10 years. If you did, thank you for reading, I wish everyone the best. ",

    "text": "Hi there. I'm a 27yo man which is suffering a form of depression due to general loneliness, low social interactions, low self esteem and lack of any romantic relationship in my life. It's been a LONG time since I've started dealing with this problem, and to this day, I still cannot solve it. I'm generally unhappy on how my life turned out. In another attempt to solve the been hearing a psychologist for the past year, + a short hop to the psychiatrist, which has given me anti-depressants that I'm taking every day. Initially I was thinking that going to the psychologist might have been a good idea, but the months passed, and. I feel like I'm making no progress whatsoever. She says that I actually managed to make progress, but she also essential claims I tend to talk myself down too much, and that's why I'm seeing no improvements according to her. I for the life of me can't see it, I still feel like crap. I'm not happy and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I'm also trying other stuff that has been suggested by brainstorming with her, such as hitting the gym, or participating in group theatre, but none of this looks like is mastering to me in the long run. I'm worried I'm wasting my money with a problem that cannot be solved. A part of me says to stop doing this stuff, accept the fact that I'm a lower and that I'll be forever alone and move on. It may sound catastrophistic, but after 27 years of this is nearly impossible to think there is a way out of this. I stopped believing in it. It's a very negative thought process, and that's why I'm still hesitant in dropping the psychologist. I'm losing lots of money to follow this therapy, and it's looking completely useless to me, but after I'm done with her, the only thing I can do is accepting the fact that I cannot solve my problems, because if even talking to an expert doesn't help me, there is nothing else that can. I don't know what to do anymore. My life sucks. I'm fearing that I'm not thinking logically anymore. I wanted to hear some suggestions, because I'm in a roadblock, I'm leaning more towards dropping the therapy, but there is a drip of uncertainty in me. ",

    "text": "Hi. I'm a 15 year old student living in the Up. When I was 6-7 I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and for most of my life I have needed to miss out on a lot of school because of it. Due to this I have dealt with bullying for almost my entire life. It used to really get to me but now i have grown up, taller, broader and now people don't bully me as much apart from my name. The bullying doesn't get to me anymore it just kind of annoys me a little that people try to go out of their way to make me sad but all it does is make me laugh because they're just wasting their time. However, a few of my friends get bullied because of ADHD, anger issues, birth defect, etc. So if I hear of someone bullying them I get so mad because they are purposefully hurting someone I love and having no consequences. I do not retaliate because that's not who I am. I am usually seen as quiet and gentle (not my words). Anyway, for the last few years I have really struggled with my (diagnosed) severe stress and social anxiety. So much so that my hands get covered in scratches all the time because running my hands is what I do when I get anxiety and stress attacks. I also noticed that every now and then I go through phases of feeling nothing but sadness that could last anywhere from a few days to a few months. I never knew much about depression although I had suspected it in the past but I thought I was just too young to understand it back then. Now, after doing some research I have started to think that may be what has been happening to me the last few years and don't really know what to do. My family and friends already know about it and they are really supportive about it. Thanks you. ",

    "text": "I (M32) haven't been in work for about 13 years now, I spent most of my early 20s looking for a job and not getting anywhere and when I was 24 I had to stop looking due to several mental breaks, trauma and other issues that arose at that time. Over the past 8 years I have been unable to look for work due to my mental health and every time I try to even look up the possibility of working I end up having a small (sometimes much larger depending on how bad I feel) breakdown, I panic and just lose all motivation to even look and the older I get the harder it feels to even think about getting any kind of job. The sad thing is I do want to do something with my life but due to a mixture of poor qualifications, mental and physical health conditions I don't even know what job I could even get and the worst part is I don't even know what I would want to do In I had the choice and qualifications. I have no real ambitions besides maybe moving to the USA because I have friends there and it's been a dream of mine since I was a kid but honestly due to a lot of the issues I have already mentioned that is most likely just a pipe dream at this point. A lot of people have told me that I should turn my hobbies into a job. Said hobbies include art, painting minus, writing and a couple of other things but I don't really want to turn those into jobs because I know if I do I'll just end up hating them from doing them all the time, the deadlines on doing them would overwhelm me or I'll end up working for a person who will exploit my love for those things to the point where I end up killing myself (figuratively. mostly) over them. I just don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can move on with my life, meet my personal goals of moving to the Up, improving myself to the point where I feel like I am happy or meeting a partner and settling down without first finding a way to escape my current situation and get a job. Another issue about me and this whole thing is I seriously don't want to just settle, I don't want to just get a job to have a job, I feel like if I did that I'd just end up more demoralized and end up taking my own life in the end. I want a job I like and that I feel is worth while but I don't know what that would be and until I do I don't know what my first steps would even be and even if I did know that stuff and what steps to take my Anxiety, Depression and TSD will just hold me back even more. I feel lost and useless and like at this point I am just running down the clock until I either just give up and end it myself or slowly dwindled away to the point I am nothing but a shell. I'm worried if I don't act soon it'll all just be over and I'm even more worried by the fact I am starting to feel ok about that. Edit: Something else that I just realized. I don't feel like I am worthy of having the friends that I have because of who I am right now, I just feel like they can do better than having a guy like me around, they're all doing big things with their lies and even the ones not doing anything big are all doing better things then me. Someday it feels like they would be better off if I just left and let them get on with their lives without me even though I know they would refute that. I just want them to be proud of me and for them to feel like I am on their level even though they don't seem to care where I am with my life right now. ",

    "text": "So, like the title says I feel like I have a serious mental illness but I cant seem to quite figure out what it is. Its like Im permanently awkward, socially inept, rigid, and overwhelmed. Im female, college age, and have always been like this for every single symptom. I received sporadic therapy/interventions as a child/teenager but nothing has really stuck or helped me. Ive been diagnosed with plenty of things: BD, bipolar 2, CD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, at one point just general personality disorder. Now that Im an adult I cant afford to just hop around therapists who arent giving me the treatment I need. No therapy or medications have ever helped with my symptoms. This is going to be super long because Im not really sure how to concisely describe my symptoms. But Im honestly really struggling to function with work/school/adulthood and Im looking for any type of advice on how to proceed. Depression? : Previous professionals said these were depression symptoms. I can't tell when I'm hungry until I'm literally going to pass out. I would rather go without eating if I don't have my favorite foods. I can't tell when something is wrong with my body, like getting sick or, once, an organ infection I didn't even feel until I was almost septic. I will stay awake until I pass out standing sometimes. I just can't introspect about how I physically feel until I'm basically nonfunctional. I'm not sad so I don't think it's depression? I feel like I'm piloting a character that I can see but can't feel. Social issues: Basically, I have a lot of social difficulties understanding others intentions or reading between the lines. I find it very hard to make friends or relate to other people because of it. I come off as unfriendly because I dont really make facial expressions if that makes sense? When I try to make expressions while talking to others or even make eye contact I feel like a very bad actor and I think its even more off-putting. Its not really justawkwardness but I dont know how else to describe it? One previous psychiatrist said I lack emotions/empathy but thats really not true. I feel a lot and I care about other people. Anxiety: I have constant racing anxiety in public. I constantly think about if Im standing too still, or moving too much, or if normal people are acting the way Im acting. I try to copy what other people are doing but I still seem to stick out. It makes my public anxiety so much worse. Im really irritable/snap constantly to anyone who goes grocery shopping with me because its just such an awfully anxious, loud, overwhelming experience for me. I get the sense that its not like this for other people and they just run errands peacefully? . OCDish? Behavior: I think CD is probably the only accurate diagnosis Ive received but Ill write out these symptoms too. Ive always been very rigid about routines and needing to do things in a certain order/way. Some examples are different kinds of food cant touch on my plate, microwave must be stopped at a certain time, etc. Plans CANNOT change suddenly or Im likely to cry/have a weird adult temper tantrum. Adult temper tantrums: I have these weird. tantrums? Or thats the only way I can think to describe it. It especially happens when I have been working a lot or after running a lot of errands. I get really overwhelmed and frustrated and have no idea what to do next or how to soothe myself. I end up crying and hitting myself in the face/head to the point of cruising and swelling. I have never felt violent towards others and Im not angry when this happens so I dont think I have anger issues. This was diagnosed in the past as panic attacks but it feels nothing like my anxiety. Tantrum is really the only word for it. This is the worst thing for me and it takes days to fully recover. Dumb smart person: Im super dumb while also being smart? I get very good grades and read/write a lot. I like learning new things, reading nonfiction, etc. But I dont get very simple things sometimes. I understand jokes hours later, or dont realize someone is talking to me even if theyre looking directly at me, or dont understand what someone is explaining to me verbally. It feels like when Im alone Im really intelligent but in interactions I feel like I literally have brain damage sometimes. I sometimes write out my speaking lines in advance for interactions to prevent the Dumb Smart Person thing from happening. Misc: Some things people have said are odd about me. I only think in words, I literally cannot picture anything. I sometimes struggle to speak, like I just cant get the words out. Sometimes I go mute for a while. I widget a lot and distract others in school/work environments. I have a hard time concentrating if not doing several things at once (such as reading a book in class or listening to music at work). And thats about it, I think. Im so sorry for the wall of text. Im not looking for an internet diagnosis, Im just wondering if anyone has experienced similar symptoms and gotten treatment for it or if I really am just super awkward and this is normal? I dont know if Id be wasting more time/money pursuing professional help when it has been so useless for me in the past. ",

    "text": "TLDR at the end. I hope this will be a relatively short summary. A few disclaimers, first I am aware that I need professional help. The problem I present here is just a byproduct of my past so I should work that out to truly resolve the issue and I intend to seek mental help as soon as I can (I am financially restricted). I realize there are free and low-cost mental health services available, but the ones in my area do not offer a consistent counselor, so I don't think I can really work with deeper trauma that requires several sessions to confront. So as a high school student, I was never overwhelmed by homework, classes, or friends. It was pretty easy-going for me. However, in the few times I felt stressed out, I would get angry and lash out a bit at my family, then stew in my anger for a bit longer, and use a little bit of willpower to start doing homework and I would be a so to speak. Because of my anger, I could finish my homework quickly and always be ahead of schedule for the week. These bursts of anger followed by productivity would usually happen once a month at most. My current issue is, now that I am a university student and despite learning to control my anger better, the workload I have is a bit insane. A professor here is well-known for assigning 30+ hour homework assignments for a single class (and recommends the infamous 80 hour work week). I no longer lash out at people around me and I spend most of my time trying to finish my work. This wouldn't be an issue if I was losing motivation. I am still very enthusiastic about the topic I am studying but the assignments are so mundane and so draining every single week. At some point, I realized I was artificially finding ways to anger myself to provide the necessary fuel required for me to push through these assignments. After a semester and a half of doing so (approximately 6 months) I fully realize how unhealthy it is. I am so drained that I find it hard to get angry, but when I do, I can't sleep and I forget to eat for multiple days. But this anger wasn't like the old anger that I could use as fuel, this anger prevents me from doing work. I am barely keeping up with my assignments and I have made crucial decisions to rank my classes in levels of importance to my major and only focus on classes that I really need to graduate. In the other classes, I allow myself to miss some points on the assignments and occasionally skip them. What I want to know is if there is a way to turn myself around. Is there some other source of motivation I can tap into or some healthier regiment that I can follow for productivity? I am still very enthusiastic about the topic I am studying, it's just that the university forces all majors to take classes in other departments as well. Used anger to boost productivity in high school. The anger boost still works in university, but the workload is too high so I try to create bursts of anger, which are tiring me out even more than the work. Where do I turn to for motivation? ",

Are there any short-release medications that help with calming anxiety or stabilizing / boosting mood? Or anything that you would / would not recommend based on personal experience? For context, I have complex trauma, I am seeing a therapist, Ive been described as presenting with anxiety, and when I raised the topic of BD, my then therapist said I had BD traits. ",

Hiding it in public was the worst feeling ever. I hate it when people misunderstand how I am feeling wish to tell them but they'll just get more annoyed at me for that. I'm sick of being me and would rather be dead than be here. I'm just sick and tired of everything. I want to be okay for once. I try my hardest to make things better for myself and others but nothing seems to be working. I can't do it. Nobody seems to even care nor notice what's happening to me. I can't just tell them because it will annoy them and probably insult me even more. I keep asking God why are these things happening to me and wish to have at least one person to tell me that everything is going to be okay and that I am perfect just the way I am. I'm broken, sad, confused, and the biggest mistake to ever exist. Nobody would want to see me cry, complain, and be vulnerable. They'd rather see me wearing the pretty and happy mask. It just makes things easier for them. Moments when I feel this way forces me to daydream of a life that makes me feel loved and that I truly matter. My daydreams are filled with so many people that love and support me, my successful acting career, and so much more. It's one of the few ways I can escape from this ugly reality that I am facing. I wish to be positive but my soul is broken and lost. Incomplete. Broken. Those are the two words that describe my overall self. I can't do it. I just want to sleep forever and live forever in my dreams to escape my misery. ",

Spiking my coffee with bailey, mixing small pop bottles with whiskey and sitting on a park bench with a bottle of Perrier mixed with Gin. Disclaimer I do not drive, I do not own a vehicle nor have a valid drivers license at the current time no drinking and driving here. I have been to A. A. and many 12 step programs many times don't suggest this be an easy fix. I will return home before I'm visibly intoxicated and that's probly why I have not been arrested but I'm aware I could be playing Russian reset here. The question I have is how much did I fuck my brain up because I'll explain. I came home and still had a bit of whiskey on hand. Rank it as I was watching YouTube on my phone and towards the last glass the following happened. A sharp pain went though my head to my jaw and caused a sharp pain going to my tinged then traveled across my chest and though my arm to my finger felt as though lightning went though me and my body spaced. I was standing when this occurred and I sat down breathing very heavily and with pain in my chest. I sat there watching the rest of the youtube and after the pain went away. I felt dizzy and light headed but alright enough not to call 911 as the chest pain wasn't therebut I have been drinking for years and never in my life experienced such a the time I wasn't drinking much either I had drank way more at once then that before. Maybe wrong place to post but what happened to me and why I'm I still reaching for the bottle despite this. I pray I find a way out and despite telling no one about this have reached out to some church members to get more involved with things there in a means to distract are my diagnostics if it helps give what happened to my body or anxiety,BD,ADHD,a learning disability and autistic features(more testing required to determine if I have the disability or not).

    "text": ". Over the last couple of years Ive noticed that I dont quite fit in. And I dont mean that as in I just have some niche interests that separate me from my peers, no. I feel as if my head is somewhere else. I become more and more isolated, from classmates and acquaintances, now friends and even family. I am not depressed, nor do I have social anxiety, but my social interactions feel forced, like I am acting to make everybody else perceive me a certain way. Lately my memory has been foggy and I have trouble discerning between dreams and reality. And more recently I have heard sounds, whispering, electronics, among other sounds while lying awake at night. I have also been more violent recently. I have a feeling it may be due to a recent accident I had that banned my body up quite a bit, I wouldnt be surprised if that left me with some loose screws. Back to the social aspect, I am not entirely sure what the source of my difficulties are. I am not much different from those around me. I dress well, I am fit, and I am one of the more attractive people in my class. But socially I dont seem to work like everyone else. I havent really talked to a girl let alone gotten to a personal level with one since Covid lockdown began. My circle of friends grows distant and unrecognizable to me. My family is my only real social that I have anymore. I still go to school, but when I talk to others it feels like Im going through the motions. I have no deep connections to any one person there. I feel like something is wrong with me. I want somebody to notice and help me but its as if Im wearing a mask and they cannot see what is happening. I want to go back to normal. I know Im not crazy because if I were I would not be aware of my situation. But I cant keep going down this path. My years in high school are coming to an end and if I dont fix this before I graduate I fear I will never fully recover.

    "text": ". Hi! I'm searching for help because I'm at loss on what to do. A little back story about me, I have had depression for about 10 years now. My biggest issue I suffer with is crying at everything. My response is always to cry at anything stressful whether it's something big or small. I have tried everything under the sun to cope with it and the best thing I've found to do is to surround myself with positive and supportive people for my conditions. I am a very private person and I don't like to talk much about my depression/anxiety. I only talk to people I know who I'm safe to talk with. Along with my depression journey I decided to switch up jobs completely and do something I absolutely love to do, which is to work with dogs. I started working for a private business in the state of Georgia so I don't know much about private business rules and such. I started this job around October and started to do really well with myself. I would say the best I've done since I've been officially diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I started out as a dog father and showed promise so I was told by the owner that she wanted to give me the opportunity to become a grooming intern. I felt extremely good because I was doing something I absolutely loved but with good things comes the bad. As soon as I was told this I was instantly doubted by the salon manager because of my anxiety/depression. She told everyone in the salon that I wouldn't make it. I kinda shrugged it off because I know not to listen to people that can't be supportive of me. As time past drama became a issue and anyone that works in a grooming salon knows there's nothing but drama. There were a few times that I got emotional (never because of the dogs) but because almost everyone around me would be constantly putting down someone. This started to take a toll on my mental health. I felt extremely unsupported and around nothing but negativity. One day the owner of the business pulled me in her office to talk. She was explaining to me how learning to grooming was hard and I better or I wouldn't make it. And of course my response was to cry because I don't like being cornered and not being able to stand up for myself. Later than day I was stopped and asked if she could purchase me natural remedies for my depression to try to help me it. She proceeded to tell me a story about how she a family members depression. I was definitely caught off guard and thought it was extremely unprofessional. I barely even know this person nor does this person know me or the struggles I've been though. Especially to be asked that when I consider myself to be doing the best I have been in a long time just didn't sit right with me. More time past and my job review came around. The owner pulled me in the office and basically told me the same thing except added about how half of people don't make it to groom because their emotions get in the way. At the end of the review I was told that my goal needs to be to get my depression under control and my medication correct. Again I thought that was a very unprofessional thing to say especially when it comes to talking about medications. Time passed and what started out as a week away from me interning to almost 2 months now and learning only learning two things about grooming. Rumors had started floating around about the owner talking to other co workers about my depression and how they were concerned about me. At this job I have met a person I would consider to be one of my bestfriends for life. I would definitely say she has helped me learn more about at standing up for myself. For the last few days I have felt down because of petty drama happening at work and people being hateful towards me for no reason so I have kept my head down and followed my rule, go to work, head down, finish work, and go home. I am the type of person that believes work is work. Work isn't my life. My life it out of work so I do not consider co workers like some do, they are just strangers I work with. Today I finally got the courage to ask the owner about my grooming internship because of the rumors I've been hearing. Before I could get anything out of my mouth I was asked what was wrong with me. My response was nothing I just needed to ask some questions and was told by the owner I need to cut the bullshit and tell her what's wrong because she knows something is wrong with me. I explained that I had some concerns by the end of convoy I was crying because it's a stressful situation for me. After the conversation I went into a more private room so I could calm myself down and my friend followed right behind me to help me get through a hard situation. She is the only person I do feel comfortable with at work. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the owner telling me to come talk to her again and telling my friend to leave. I was sat down and asked what's wrong which ended in me not being about to get a word out because I was being compared to the now salon manager. A few other points I was told was 1. I needed to fix my medication and get help 2. I was too sensitive. 3. I needed to look in the mirror. 4. I wasn't the same person since I started (no longer had a big happy smile everyday) 5. there was concerns that I was going to break learning how to groom. During this she kept mentioning that she has been talking about my conditions to the salon manager and a coworkers that isn't a manager but more like a owners pet. I was basically gaslighted the whole conversation. My biggest thing is that I don't bring my personal life into work. I go to work, I work, and I leave. Nobody knows my struggles and I don't care to share and I have made this very clear a few times to my owner but somehow it always comes back up. My concern now is everything I told her today because I was basically forced is going to be spread throughout the salon. Nothing is confidential here and it sucks because I don't want my information out there. The owner thinks she helped me with this conversation but really she just made me feel worse about myself. I do consider myself a very functional person with depression. I force myself to get up and work to keep myself distracted. I thought this job was my safe place where I could go do something I love but now I feel horrible about everything. I Have doubts and it's wanting to make me quit my goals and dreams of being a groomed. This is something I've set my soul in and to basically be told I'm broken today really hurt and made me go on a downward spiral. It really was the cracking point. I would try to find another job but where I live it's very hard to find someone to train in grooming. I believe the owner and the salon manager is definitely overstepping their boundaries but it's not like I can go to a He person because they are hr. I'm just at a loss on what to do. Any words of advice? ",

    "text": "Okay. Well, I really didn't want to make another post on here. However I'm afraid I'm not getting better. I have an obsession with someone. I do have immense feelings for them and have their best intentions at heart, it wasn't until a month ago I realized I had become obsessed. Now I've been taking as much time away from them (their mental health is not great and we are very close friends or were. ) as I can while still trying to make sure I am there to help them. However I've noticed even though I'm not talking to them as much, my life still revolves around them. Like planning how long until I reach out again, I have to deescalate my obsessive thought patterns, especially when it comes to them. Now initially I thought it. Was doing really well than after almost two weeks of no contact I reached out and they were really struggling so I feel like I've gone back to square one. Now I have no ill will and recognize this is incredibly unhealthy for me and them, and I honestly desire nothing more than to learn how to overcome this and just continue to be close supports for one. I have to really think about my actions beforehand when it comes to them now and make sure im doing something because it is actually for them, and not coming from my own unhealthy obsession. This is really hard on me emotionally and mentally. I feel like I have to watch my thoughts 24/7 to get better. I haven't told anyone about this because I don't know how to tell someone without them thinking that my obsession is like that of a creepy stalker or some shit. I would never do that kind of stuff, but the obsession is still real and unwanted. Furthermore I've known them for a long time and have not always been obsessed, I think. I'm not even sure anymore, I don't know how far this unhealthy root goes. ",
