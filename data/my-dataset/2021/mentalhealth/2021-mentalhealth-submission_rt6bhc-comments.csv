I was just in another sub I won’t name and made a post about how I’m really passionate about something I’m *very* new at. I was literally just asking for advice from knowledgeable people in the field, but I was met with multiple comments asking me “if I was stupid” and “how I could literally be so ****ing dumb.” I will admit my post wasn’t worded the best but I responded to comments and edited my post to clarify. I got one or two nice comments explaining to me what I didn’t understand, but most of them were just telling me I was dumb. I was super excited to get into this passion of mine, but now I feel like no matter what I do or how hard I work at it, I’ll never get good enough. I know I shouldn’t listen to a bunch of randos on the internet, but I’m not in the best mental state at the moment. As dumb and probably naive as it sounds I’m just really struggling to deal with everything. I’m sorry if I’m being super sensitive or whatever. I just don’t have anyone to talk to about this. Anyway yeah sorry thanks for reading."
