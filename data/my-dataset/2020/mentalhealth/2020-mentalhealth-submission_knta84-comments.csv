Yes, bro! This is one of the ‚ÄúOver-thinking‚Äù symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much.

Her mom died years ago and her dad died this year (not from covid). She has been living with her grandma and aunt ever since I knew her.

&#x200B;

She has been struggling with depression before I knew her and I only knew about it a year ago. I tried everything to support her but I could only do so much because we lived in different states. I even gave her the suicide hotline. At first glance it sounded like it worked because she said it went well and that they would call her the next day as well. The next day though they didn't call back, I told her that she didn't have to wait for them and I encouraged her to call again but I don't think she ever did.

&#x200B;

She tried running away once with her friends because of home life and school. I convinced her not to do it but I think about it a lot. She has also made comments likes. ""I have no purpose in life"" (this was when I gave her the hotline number) and more recently ""I just want to sleep and never wake up. I'm so tired!"" At this point I'm really worried because I feel like I can't do anything and nothing is working. She sometimes complains of body aches with most of them being headaches, stomach pains, and leg pains. It breaks my heart to see that she is stressed to the point of physical pain. 

&#x200B;

Now I don't have depression and I know I don't but I have been stressing knowing she isn't feeling better and I don't know what I'm going to do if she ends up killing herself (I won't follow her if she does but I will of course, be deeply distraught). 

&#x200B;

I already know that I can't do very much because I am an online friend and not physically there. I already know that most of the advice will most likely be ones I already know/tried. I already know that it's not my fight and she can get better by herself. But I don't want to just stand to the side and hope for the best either. I want to help."

Nor do I think diagnoses and labels are without their problems, but I am about to talk to my GP about switching medication and I need to know how to be able to recognize hypomania if I have experienced it.

For a while, I have been living with depression and medicated for it, which I would say worked reasonably well for a little while maybe? For sure, my meds are not working as they should be by now. A few things led me to question whether I have depression or if it is bipolar depression: 1.) When I last saw my doctor, who asked how my meds were, I told him I thought my meds were only ""working half the time"" because I was experiencing dramatic ups and downs in a fairly predictable cycle. 2.) During a blow-up with my parents where I was overcome by rage, my parents accused me of needing to see a professional for manic depression rather than depression alone. 3.)  A new therapist that I have seen claims she thinks I show more symptoms of bipolar than depression. She bases this on what I have told her about restless 'episodes' where I feel very creative but also highly irritable.Why do I doubt that it could be bipolar disorder? Mainly cause I don't feel grandiosity or elation. I pretty much feel sad most/all of the time but occasionally I will have days where instead of sad I feel really irritable and creative (almost like an acid trip?). I also tend to embellish my experiences so I worry that my therapist could be interpreting my words which could be inflated or overstated, as I am an emotional person obviously.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this and I am terribly sorry to anyone who is bugged by this post, but I suppose I am asking the question *how can I know if I am experiencing a 'manic period'? How do I know if it is more than depression? Could these odd swings be caused by my current medication or extenuating circumstances? What is the next step in finding out which it is?*

Edit 1: A few extra details for those who might want it. \*On nights where I am able to sleep, I constantly have dreams of me causing an irrational scene in front of my family, where I blow up into a rage and scare them. I have done this before in real life and it terrifies me the idea that I could harm them or make them feel threatened. I don't really know what these dreams mean but I know that they manifest fear I have of this 'angry side.' \*My family has a strong medical history with persistent depression and a weaker medical history with bipolar disorder (at least one member on my dad's side had it?) \*My therapist also contends it could be bipolar disorder because of my obsession with certain things, my proclivity to self-sabotage, and the fact I have expressed that medication may not be for me because I sometimes like this 'angry side' of me for the creativity it brings out of me."

I'm a first year at a london uni btw. But yeah I feel like I'm not doing well in my friendships. Some advice?,3,4,1609455415.0,"Hi r/mentalhealth.

Before I launch off, this is a very very long post (took me like 1 and a half hours lol) and would probably take you 20 minutes to digest so I would say brace urself if ur really determined to help out. This post discusses my successes and failures in making friends this term. But most importantly my worries about whether I will be able to hold onto my current friends. The post also addresses my social awkwardness and why I think I'm this way. If ur going to give advice, please read the whole thing so you can understand my situation better. And if you click by this thread, please take to help me. I would really appreciate it. Just 20 mins of ur day. Ty

Let's begin.

I'm kinda paranoid about whether I've made solid friends or not during my first semester. It feels weird to call them friends since they feel nothing like my old ones who I have a very close connection to (I've never been the best at making friends so only really had two good friends during a levels). While I did feel a bit depressed during my A levels, I realize quality > quantity. I could ofc not care about making friends but if I don't have these interactions, I won't make a good doctor since my professional identity won't develop. Also being lonely might take a toll on my studies (I hate it so much why does it do that?).

At uni, I've been struggling between quality vs quantity. But tbh both quality and quantity in my friendships have been lacking because of online learning and I live at home. Might be because of COVID but I still want to explore deeper. So I only really made some connections with 2 coursemates and maybe a third one (I'll discuss more about him but I feel like it's a very loose connection). No flatemates since I live at home. But I will be moving into a student flat at some point.

Me and friend 1 were both really eager to be friends. He reached out to me on the Imperial college london freshers app. A couple of days later, we even had a zoom call. It was taking off very well. This was 2 weeks before uni started. We still talk to each other regularly over whatsapp and have some solid conversations. We have at least one common interest so there's a talking point. I really think I will have a good connection with friend 1 over time.

Friend 2 has so many shared interests. We are basically clones of one another. He's a few years above me so I'm slightly intimidated by that. And he also has his own friend circle so I kinda feel like an intruder but I feel like it should go well. We got lots to talk about but there's still a problem. I'll come back to that.

'Friend' 3 doesn't have that many similar interests to me apart from maybe one. We mostly talk about work in our conversations and occasionally about interests and other stuff. I kind of feel inferior to him because he's very outgoing, good in social situations and isn't socially awkward like me. I'm basically the opposite as I'm kind of awkward in social settings. I feel like such an awesome guy would never want to be friends with me after finding out what I'm truly like so I feel like this friendship is doomed. He's good in small talk, he's professional but I'm not.

My attitude towards friendships so far has been going for quality rather than quantity so I've not reached out to millions of people just those 3 really. Friend number 2, I made a brave attempt to add him and explain that we have like the same games so we should play together sometime. Friend no 3 wanted to DM me something (after chatting on the main groupchat) so I had an excuse to have him on my contacts. And because he was there, we could start chatting properly.

Now onto the problems. Like I said. I'm not experienced at making friends at all. I can talk but I'm a bit socially anxious. But I will always face social situations. I forced myself to go to online fresher meetings and public speaking society. I almost got over my anxiety in social situations (after finding out they went better than I thought) but I haven't had any physical interactions with coursemates since start of uni (once freshers was over). Lack of social interactions has made me fall back into being socially anxious again but I still force myself to speak up in online class and I try to speak for a long time whenever I give feedback to others.

Now let's go back to when I said I'm a bit rubbish at making friends. Ok so I add them, ask how they're doing, their interests.How do I know how often I should text them?How do I avoid coming across as desperate when making friends? Like sometimes I'll genuinely want to talk to them but I fear that if I keep initiating too many conversations, they'll think I'm desperate. But at the same time, I don't want to text them once in the blue moon since they'll think I don't care nowAlso should I always initiate conversations or wait for them to start one sometimes? Because with friends 2 and 3, it's always me. Friend 1 and me do it equally so there's no issues but I still do a bit more than friend 1.Friend 3 did it maybe 2 times but pretty much I always initiate the convo.I always initiate the convo with friend 2.Now am I being paranoid for thinking that they're not as interested if I always have to start the conversation?I have to admit, they are receptive in these conversations and the convos always take off so it's not like they dislike me right?

So the thing is, with my current best friend, I never have to worry about these things. I can text him whenever I want and as many times as I want. I don't even need to do small talk to initiate conversations. I can just ask him 'hey what do you think of mario bros?' and that won't weird him out.

But with my uni 'friends', I can't do these things. It will seem random if I ask questions like that. I can't text whenever I want. I can't text them as much as I want.If I text them all the time, I'll come across as needy or trying too hard which will put them off. But how on earth can I deepen a connection if I'm supposed to limit how much I talk to them?How does friendship even work anymore? I literally can't understand it.

Another problem is that I can't really do stuff together with my uni friends because we can't meet in person due to COVID so we can't go the cinema or have a coffee together or any of those activities which builds friendship.That being said, me and friend 2 have plans to play together online in our video game so that should do something.

Another thing about friend 2. He seems another one of those sociable dudes who have lots of friends. So I feel like he's going to look down at me if he ever discovers my social awkwardness. He can talk about stuff easily but I can't. He might be annoyed by me then.

Also I was planning to have a study together with friend 3 but I'm worried that we'll do all these things together then he will ditch me when face to face teaching resumes. Why? Because of the way I am. That will hurt a lot. Trying to get close to someone and then get ditched. That's why I'm reluctant to invest in friend 3 since ik the friendship will probably fall apart. That's why I'm also reluctant to contact him a lot. And friend 2 to some extent. I want to put in effort to see a friendship which won't end. Not for someone to meet me in real life and think I'm a dork.

I've also failed when I tried to make friends with 2 other people. A girl added me when I asked about a flat groupchat and I felt we talked pretty well. The next day I asked how she's been keeping and she doesn't reply even though she read the message.So I assume she's not interested and never contact her again. I feel like if I did, then she would think I'm desperate especially when she seems disinterested.

Another guy I thought I got on well with. We had some really good conversations so I thought why not add this person? Seems like a solid dude. I was really excited for what I thought would be a great potential friend but he was like the other guy. Reads my messages and never replies. I said hi how are u doing? When I added him. Didn't reply. Funny thing is that he doesn't ignore me on the anime group chat and we had solid convos there. So I sent him another DM, it was read and ignored again. And I'm pretty sure he knows it's me and not some random person. I'm so confused about him. I've been thinking of cutting contact there too but surely I must be mistaken?

Now a few things about me before I close off. When I say I'm socially awkward, I mean that I'm not very good at small talk and feel fake when I say 'how are you' when I couldn't care less. Only for my closest friends. But then I wouldn't need small talk in the first place. If I genuinely feel like asking it, I will. Only if I don't need to fake it and I mean it. This is why small talk sucks. You pretend to care about strangers.I'm good at deep talk. I'm good when we have extremely similar interests we are both passionate about.But here's the thing about me. I lack common knowledge and have no interest in mainstream things like politics or the inbetweeners or any Netflix shows that everyone talks about. Understandably this makes it hard to find talking points with the average person. So I'm rather limited to who I can connect with. I don't want to pretend to be interested in main stream things so why talk to people who are?I'm interested in a few video games, history, the dark web and medicine ofc.Also another thing about me which makes me suffer in conversations. I have an extremely thin skin. Like if someone calls me an idiot (even though I'm pretty smart actually), I will internalize that insult and get offended and mad. I will get mad not because of the insult really but because why would someone say something uncalledfor for no reason at all? Also how can someone call you an idiot if they have no proof of it? Do they know ur IQ? Have they done an IQ test on you? This is the types of things that I think about when insulted.Now the issue is I'm very scared of being insulted because I'm not good at witty comebacks. I feel like if i say ' please don't say that, it's hurtful' everyone will think I'm a softy. I'm not scared of the insult itself really. Just my social awkwardness gets pronounced when I get insulted because I have no idea how to react to it. I wish there was a manual on it lol.This links to my social awkwardness a lot. I try to find the nicest way to say things and make sure there's no way I can insult someone by what I say. Because I don't want to be insulted back because I can't handle it.So this means I take longer to think about what I want to say. Even if there's an easy way to say something, I'll have a million suggestions whizzing through my mind and this is why I usually jumble my words when I speak sometimes. All because I want to say stuff in the best way that won't hurt anyone.I've tried to combat this by speaking my mind on a few occasions. I've got myself in trouble due to this on internet forums with everyone thinking I'm childish.

If I could start a convo with 'hi can we talk about history?' I wouldn't be socially awkward at all. Because we can skip the small talk and get into the deep talk which I'm not bad in. But apparently society thinks u must be abnormal if u wish to skip small talk. Anyway that was a mini rant.

I feel like if COVID didn't happen, I would have maintained the social skills I developed and was working hard to improve. But ofc if you can't meet anyone anymore, it's going to suffer and plummet all the way down. But then again without COVID I might have still been screwed since I didn't make much friends in A levels.

Let me quickly discuss my old friends. In A levels, there was a bunch of new people coming to join our year group. But I already had a very good friend from lower years so he was one of my good friends too for A levels and even now. The other was a new person but I liked him for the way he was. Like me, he hates small talk. It was perfect since I met another person who doesn't mind if I start with deep talk. And he was a mutual friend too with my other.I did socialise with others too during A levels but they were never anything more than acquaintances. Kind of like what my uni friends are now. Acquintances not friends.

Well done if you got this far. I hope you read it thoroughly since I really need help but I'm waiting to see if I can get good advice here on reddit. I would seek therapy I guess but idk whether I need it or not. I think all I need is a simple change in mindset. Furthermore, idk where i can find therapists. Also they will probably charge money which I don't have. My parents would just laugh if i asked them about therapy. Therapy isn't really on my plate unless it's free.

Also one more question: Is there any point in reaching out to more people over groupchats? It seems everyone's so distant with COVID even with each other. Nobody in my class groupchat has even bothered to get to know one another. But when there were small group tasks, it felt pretty nice talking to actual people for once. This only happened twice tho. Not enough times for them to pick up on how lame I am.

I'm sure that situational factors aid this most, however after living with depression since childhood with a constant mask on, I feel I have finally moved passed this chronic phase in my life. I am still trying to articulate how I was able to do it, but I think overall the most profound thing was my dad dying 2 years ago. Strangely it was the most painful thing I have ever been through in my life, I miss him daily, but something in me shifted and I started to feel like if I can let my dad go, then I can lose anything in my life and survive and be okay, also that if I can overcome that then I can overcome any challenge or fear and I feel a deep sense of being free now.

It's very weird and a part of me feels it's too good to be true because I lived with feeling low and disconnected from others all my life. But I wanted to write this to share for anyone else who has been through the motions of depression, particularly from childhood, that there is light at the end of the deep, dark tunnel and that we need to make active decisions to chose things for ourselves that are helpful or pleasurable, because we can have good days and enjoy life again. <3 Sending love and hopefulness for 2021 in these unprecedented times!"

I have managed to find myself in a nice place in life thanks to various factors. My suicidal thoughts are gone. But now I feel I've lost my plan B, the always present exit, and my anxiety symptoms have worsened significantly. They are caused by some events which would have made me nervous in the past as well, just not as much. This permanent state of anxiety takes a toll on these factors which saved my life. I just cannot fail, if I do, I will relapse into depression.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Any advice is welcome."

1.  I have pretty severe but varying depression and I was diagnosed with dysthymia.  I often think of killing myself and how I would do it but I feel confident that I would never act on it.  I had a bad episode a few months ago that prompted me to start therapy again. I can't say I've had a particularly difficult life and struggle with the idea of being depressed because I feel like I have no reason to be depressed.  I do this despite knowing that its an imbalance but I can't help it.
2. I work in a creative industry and have little to no creative drive until im in the thick of a project that determines my livelihood.  Independently, I am rarely artistically motivated which has been a problem that has grown more problematic within the last few years.  Overall I feel indifferent to almost everything.  This leads to some pretty heavy self destructive thinking because I see colleagues becoming better and better as I remain stale.
3.  I have an incredibly hard time focusing.  Even writing this, I'm thinking about a million other things.   My mind feels like its in a haze and I constantly forget things.  I have a hard time completing tasks and its fucking up my career, my relationship and life overall.
4. Occasionally I tend to fixate on one thing - can go hours without drinking water, eating etc - psychiatrist described it as a manic episode but not sure I agree

I have tried so many things to try and deal with these issues  so ill just go through what I've tried and maybe someone can recommend something.

Physical Activities 

* Tried running in the mornings (stopped doing because of weather)
* meditation (inconsistent on this)
* yoga (inconsistent on this)

Lifestyle Changes

* improved sleeping habits  (recently got worse)
* Therapy bi weekly (last 4-5 months)
* psychiatrist monthly (last 3 months)
* Trying to lean a language (failing miserably)

Dietary Changes

* Mostly Vegetarian diet- only occasionally eating fish
* Gluten free for celiac
* way less drinking - used to be a few 6 packs a week.  Now about  one or two 6 packs a month
* Improved eating overall - lost about 25lbs in a few months
* Multivitamins

Medicinal approaches (self prescribed)

* Nootropics
* Kratom
* Mushrooms (this was the best performer but didnt try it long enough because I ran out)

Medicinal Approaches (psychiatrist prescribed)

* Buproprion XL (low dose then increased dosage - felt absolutely nothing)
* Adderall ( was concerned about taking it regularly)
* Pristiq (about 3 months in - not feeling very different)
* Concerta 18mg ( few weeks in - same)
* 15mg L-Methylfolate ( yeh nothin)

So these are all things I've tried over the last few years and I really haven't found anything that helps much or that I notice offers much improvement so I'm just frustrated.  I'm not really sure what to do.  I'm pretty tired of feeling like this and I really don't know whats wrong with me so just wondering if anyone out there could recommend anything or offer any suggestions.  I appreciate any help."

I have always felt lonely. Even if I open up to people, I feel lonely. It did get worse over the years after my mother and my grandfather died. They were really close to me. 

On top of that, I have this self hatred. I despise every aspect about myself. I used to cut my face. Thankfully, I have stopped that. Lately, it has increased a lot that I have started starving myself and smoking. I think I'm anorexic. 

My family doesn't believe in mental health problems. My mother did, unlike my father. I went for counselling once but it was not helpful. 

Can someone help me? I'm scared that I will be depressed and lonely all my life. 

PS: Sorry about the straightforward post. I really don't know how to get over this. Everyone keeps telling me it's a phase, but I don't know about that."
knzemu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knzemu/i_dont_want_this/,I don¬¥t want this,1,3,1609453378.0,"So it¬¥s December 31.  10:53pm  


I¬¥m sick of it, sick of living my life like I do. I feel like puking and crying but as always nothing comes and my sadness shifts to nihilistic depression. At 12pm is the deadline for the easiest paper of my collegetime but I just can¬¥t do it. I fucking can¬¥t...   
I sit alone in my apartment because I wanted to because I hate the whole time from Christmas till New Years and yet I hate it to be alone right now, I hate that I wont send in the paper I hate the urge to try to do and feel better I hate being alone I hate I hate I hate. I do so much stuff I hate and never do anything that I really want or like. Well obviously that¬¥s not true but I can¬¥t see it right now in reality. In fact I am doing much better then just a year ago or even then my whole life but I am tired to fight that shit. I don¬¥t want to do any (para)suicidal stuff and I wont because I learnt because I became better but still why is it so hard? I thought at sometime the turningpoint was supposed to show up....All I do at home is gaming laying around listen to music and masturbating for that kick. I can¬¥t even watch shows or read because my thoughts are too distracting...or sleep for that matter...  
The thing is I have people in my life. I have a job where I am respected I have some friends and I am happy with my body I have hobbys and and I apparently have no problem getting laid but fuck man why can¬¥t I use all this shit to feel good? Why do I have these Impulses to fuck myself up? I am the one that pushes the dagger in my back...   
For fucks sake the only goal in my life is to be happy not even crazy like just like normal stuff appreciate a good time and dont fall into the bad enjoying being liked fall in love and shit.   
I want to be better I really do I really fucking do...  
Fuck I am like an addict addicted to doing nothing and ignoring my life .  
And everytime I do things I get the urge to relapse.  
Fuck me if I just knew it will get better I think I could do it. And knowing like believe it in my heart kinda shit.  
It has to get better right? I mean it already did but It hast to get good not just better. Just a good fucking live....why does it seem so fucking impossible?  
So what do I do? I guess I will keep on pushing like I always did because I am way to stubborn to give up but I need to try to be less stubborn and accept change into my life.   
I don¬¥t believe 2021 will get magically better but I can change it to be better. And I don¬¥t mean the big fucking C I can handle that shit I just can¬¥t handle myself and how to treat myself with respect lmao  


Sorry if you read that far this was just for me but I needed it to be somewhere out of my head and I don¬¥t feel like using my little bool rn  
But you know what? I will get better I don¬¥t let that asshat of life control me. I¬¥ll promise you that !  
I need that to be the future me I¬¥m imagineing.   


Oh and sorry for my english lol It¬¥s my second language   


Happy 2021 to you"

Friends, family, romantic relationships. The only family I talk to are my parents, because my entire family is genuinely racist (this I had no problem with). I end up ending all my friendships for one reason or another. A few examples are:

\-My best friend in high school said he was bored hanging out with me because I'm too depressed and that's all I talk about

\-Several friend of my past friends have dating my ex's or other people I was very interested in.

\-I lived with a friend and she would always blame her anxiety on me because I would walk around my room or I cleaned too loud. 

\-I lived with another friend and her bf and her bf would constantly have people over (including a guy that lead me on for months) during lockdown. When I told her I didn't feel safe, she told me her bf didn't care and can do what he wants. 

\-I lost a lot of friends defending my best friend who was hurt by our mutual friend sleeping with her abuser. (A lot of those friends sided with the mutual friend).

\-Most recently, I ended a friendship with someone who would make fun of me behind my back when I'd talk about being suicidal. 

I have reacted in ways that are less than favorable from being hurt by my friends. Things like having meltdowns, saying hurtful things, being defensive, moving out without notice and just blocking them without saying a word. I hold grudges for a long time. I've talked to therapists and psychiatrists and really gave them all the details to get an opinion. They always coddle me and sugar coat things, probably because I have ptsd. I just want a straight answer. Every time I end a friendship I think of that quote that's like ""if you keep having toxic relationships, you're the problem."" My therapist told me I end up in these toxic relationships, because I look for people to prove my core belief that I'm not good enough. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm the problem, and I don't know how to fix it. I feel so hopeless. I have a few really good friends I love and they're very honest about what I've done wrong, but they've also said ultimately it's not my fault. I've also have had old friends and exes that have contacted me to apologize. But I've also had old friends talk about how awful I am with each other after I end friendships. I just want an unbiased outsider look. If anyone has any advice please let me know, I want to be better."

I am so tired of being looked with narrow eyes, i danced today for first time in three months and i felt nobody enjoyed my presence. I designed dumb charades today and my sister kept saying no one is having fun while jumping and laughing around (she was serious when she said) When i laughed she said i was overreacting and how stupid i was, My mum didn't say anything to her... when i said she was toxic ... so my mother called me 'badtemeez' means disrespectful and saying i am like this ...leave me... i said i will go to my room because i felt bad but they didn't listen.... everyone just felt like staring at me saying i ruin the fun.... they called me a psychopath in front of my relatives... i got angry and left... Every time i go i can feel their eyes staring at me... they consistently call me it was better when i was a kid and how sweet i was... they refuse to acknowledge my deteriorating mental health... i am a bit chubby and i am lowkey proud of my body and its marks and all i love my body... my love made me love it ( nothing sexual i just feel if someone loves me and thinks i am special then why can't i?) and they say i do that(not eat) to lose weight ....hell no!!!! i don't eat anything because i feel empty and dead i don't wanna live anymore... sometimes he (my bf) makes me feel maybe its not so bad to live, maybe this time will pass... we dreamt that after all this i will get to live with him in a live-in and be with him and work hard for my love but.... it's unbearable sometimes... i don't understand the age respect factors that are put in ... i cant respect a person just because they are older than me i refuse to respect a person who ruins my self worth...Maybe i will die maybe not... but not right now maybe later...BUT i wanna fulfil my promise to him... maybe i should try a bit longer.... but i don't know if i am capable or i am worth saving

knyach,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knyach/making_new_years_resolutions_stick_is_tough/,"Making new year's resolutions stick is tough; change is hard because we're fighting habits built up over years. Rather than struggling, be aware of when your habits arise and treat them with kindness until they pass",1,1,1609449488.0,"There‚Äôs an old Zen joke: a guy is riding a horse down a road at breakneck speed, barely holding on. A person standing by the side of the road watching him scream past shouts to him, ""where are you going?"" He says, ""I don‚Äôt know, ask the horse."" Like most Zen jokes its more of a thinker than laugh out loud funny; the insight here is that we are both the rider and the horse - the rider is our conscious choices, the horse is our habits. 

To let go of our harmful habits we need to train our awareness - stopping for a few minutes each day, focusing on our breath, our bodies, our thoughts, our feelings. But just as important is training ourselves to recognize the habit when it arises. Its key not to see that habit as the enemy - when we fight ourselves we tend to lose a lot of the time. Just notice it, be aware of it and breath for a few moments, allowing it to pass.

If we care for our habit energy like a friend, listening to what it‚Äôs telling us, not treating ourselves like a battlefield or running but shining the light of awareness and allowing that awareness to transform our habits, we can start to water the seeds of joy in our life. And with enough awareness and enough time, the horse will slow down, stop and maybe even let you take the reigns.

I know not everyone believes in self-diagnosis, but, I'm very certain and sure of what I have exactly. But even tho I experience all of the symptoms for the disorders that I mentioned above, I still feel sort of, fake (?) bcuz, again, I don't have an official diagnosis. The other day I saw this post, on instagram, this girl who's a recovered anorexic, saying she ""killed herself for a diagnosis"" which is exactly what I'm doing, wanting to be ""sick enough"" to get diagnosed. Logically, a healthy person would not want to be sick. But yeah... That's how my mind works.
I just wanna know if anyone else experiences the same feeling of invalidity, or has a similar story?

I've heard of one man who jumped off a bridge who, during his fall, realized that he could fix most of his problems, except for the fact that he just jumped off a bridge.

Even in my own life, I've gravitated toward drastic solutions like quitting school and living in a van when the pressure became too much. But, when that pressure is lifted, that seems incredibly drastic and impulsive.

My question is, why does the mind do this? Is there a word for this phenomenon?"

I begin to doubt my own abilities, my own skills, and I question whether I really matter. I slowly start to lose motivation, and I find myself being sloppy in concentrating and sometimes in even doing simple tasks. Other times, my body feels so anxious, I begin to warm up, and I began to visualize scenarios that would never happen. I begin to lose touch with reality, and irrational fears, mainly concerning technology although sometimes other things, start to pop up. When these fears flare up, that's when I can't function. I start becoming short of breath, my face is red, and I feel like I'm going insane. Even when I know my fears are stupid and don't make sense, I feel compelled to believe them and its like 99.9% of me is going crazy while the 0.01% is just there, watching, whispering to me that what Im worrying about doesnt make sense, yet I can't seem to believe it. This sometimes ties in with my paranoid thoughts, where I can't trust anybody, and in some occasions, even my family members..                 

The worst part about all of this is that I know what I'm capable of, and there are certain periods of time, although rarely, where I feel like a grandiose being and I can accomplish anything. But this is, again rare, and this feeling of feeling ""somewhat good about myself"" is immediately followed by falling into an abyss of mental struggle and worry. 

&#x200B;

I haven't been able to get as much work I needed to get done as possible, and I'm starting to worry. My grades are slowly dropping, and compared to last year, I am not doing as well as I want to. I haven't been able to concentrate, and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. 

I'm scared, not just for my mental health, but for the future me. I've always been somewhat of an anxious, paranoid person, because I sort of believe that these feelings, when really minor, are natural. But over the years, my mental health has spiraled out of control, and it's only getting worse. I don't remember it being this debilitating, even during my younger years. What if I grow up to be someone crazy, or don't live very long because of my mental health? During the heat of a moment, I had cut myself on the arm to stop my paranoia and worrying, but I stopped after realizing what was going on. 

I've tried to connect with god, become more spiritual, but even during my prayers I can't seem to calm down. 

I don't know what to do.."

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve finally sound some hobbies I‚Äôm interested in. I started painting and needle felting this year. I‚Äôm not the greatest at them but it‚Äôs something that I can do whereas previous years I didn‚Äôt have any hobbies. 

‚Ä¢ I finished my first year of uni and I got a first overall. I‚Äôm now half way through my 2nd year. The online learning hasn‚Äôt been my favourite but I‚Äôve got through it. At one point I was so low that I considered dropping out. But I overcame it. 

‚Ä¢ I have been on more walks this year. Something I never did before and I found out that I love having time to myself for a bit. 

‚Ä¢ I got new piercings and tattoos. I dyed my hair purple. I feel as though I expressed myself more this year. I feel as though I‚Äôm starting to find myself more as an individual through my style. 

‚Ä¢ I donated blood! And I‚Äôm hoping to become a regular donor. 

I‚Äôm sure I could add more but those are the ones that stand out the most to me. 




For 2021 I have a few goals. I hate the idea of resolutions because they never stick so I‚Äôm just going to set some goals:
‚Ä¢ hopefully move out into my own place (and maybe get a cat!) 

‚Ä¢ try to get a first again in my 2nd year of uni (this year contributes to 40% of my final grade) 

‚Ä¢ start working on a book of shadows

‚Ä¢ prioritise myself. practise more self love. try to stay in shape but dont feel guilty about having a pizza when you‚Äôre having a bad day. 

‚Ä¢ hopefully get a new job, something that I enjoy more than my previous."

I‚Äôm having the worst time of my life.

Just 5 days ago I started to take medications for my depression and anxiety problems. 
All of this has been hard. Really, many of you can understand me about it. 
Yesterday, my boyfriend decided it was the right moment to brake up with me, telling me it‚Äôs not about my problems, that I‚Äôm perfect for him, but he doesn‚Äôt love me, he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me. And that leaving me was the right thing to do. 

I‚Äôm not mad at him, I‚Äôm glad that my family is helping me. 

But I don‚Äôt know, I think I just needed to share with someone other than my parents all of this, I don‚Äôt have close friends, and my country is in lockdown for the coronavirus. 
I just need a hug and some kind words to help me get through all this shit, and maybe some reasons to get up In the morning. 

Happy New Year guys <3 
I hope next year will be kind with all of us."

Just looking to vent and get ppl's thoughts and opinions.
Not sure if this is the correct sub to post this in but I'm not sure where else to go. I'm also on mobile, so, apologies for formatting.

I've been with SO for almost 3 years now and he had never seen me have a meltdown quite like this one. It seemed to come out of nowhere, like, I was working on something on my computer, I started stressing about how long it was taking and how much other stuff I needed to do that day, I felt incredibly bad and guilty that I needed my SO to help me with this task when I was trying to be nice and helpful and get things done all by myself so that he could sit back and relax after being at work all day, and... I just completely spiralled from there.

So, as the title implies, I had a complete meltdown. The guilt I felt during it consumed me. It was like I felt so horrible that I couldn't stand to even exist anymore. I didn't know what to do with myself and I felt so frustrated by my very being. I felt like a complete failure as a human and like my existence was hindering the happiness of everyone around me. Like I *needed* to disappear. I wanted to scream and cry as hard as I could and I was punching myself in the head, I relapsed and cut my wrists and thighs, something I hadn't done since I was a teenager. anything I could do to punish myself for being a shit human being. I was a fucking shitshow.

I suffer from depression, and, these types of ""meltdowns"" as I like to call it used to be very commonplace for me (minus the self harm, for a while at least, just the uncontrollable sobbing and strong desire to die), probably happening on a weekly basis, before I got diagnosed and started taking meds. I've been medicated about 4 years now.

After I calmed down and try to explain myself to my SO, he told me he felt like I was acting spoiled. To him, I was having a tantrum over having difficulties trying to do graphic design stuff on my computer. I felt really misunderstood. :/ I've thought about bringing it up to him again, how I feel like it's wrong and unfair to call me spoiled, but then I get second thoughts like maybe I really am just a brat. Idk. I just want to feel understood. I don't think he ""gets"" it.

Um... I don't know how to end this post so thank you if you've read this whole thing."

 I suffer from Bi-Polar type 2 which causes pretty heavy depression, anxiety and mood swings. Its has gotten to a point where I take 4 medications to keep me going and I just do not have the power anymore to improve my life. I need consistent help to help me beat this disease. 

What I was hoping to do is just sell most of my things, put a pause on my job ( which I can stay during any help that I am looking to do.), and leave to a retreat of some sort where I can learn meditation techniques, and go through mental health therapy. But, I want to live there for some time, like months to make sure I am doing what I need to, maybe even go to daily classes. I do not know what I am searching for and every search I put into google, it doesn't come back with results for places I am looking for. Just mostly online classes, and retreat's where you stay for a few days.

Hopefully that makes sense and hopefully someone knows places or a place like that. I live in Texas but willing to travel to the location.

Lately, I haven‚Äôt felt like doing anything.

knus58,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knus58/i_almost_became_a_killer/,I almost became a killer,4,4,1609437732.0,"This is not clickbait, and everything here is my attempt to be objective and truthful. I‚Äôve been seeing the rise in crime, suicide, and mental health and hopefully my story can help people understand that there are other alternatives to the sufferings of life. 

The events leading up to this are arbitrary, but I‚Äôll just point out that: I grew up with a neglectful and emotionally unstable mother, a mentally controlling father, and a very lonely childhood. I will also point out that I was raised by loving grandparents, and had a home to stay in, and food to eat all of my life. I am also not a psychopath, but I suspect that I do have (had) a strong personality disorder. I put had in parentheses for reasons I‚Äôll get into later. But anyways, here‚Äôs the night I almost became a killer. (Names have been changed to protect the anonymity of friends and family)

So one night my cousin and I had driven to this lot where new houses were being built. It was an open field with half-built houses, and the sky was pitch black‚Äîthere was not a single cloud in the entire sky, even though the moonlight barely shone through some of the clouds. 

Well, up until this point I had been feeling completely disconnected from reality and from people in general, including my entire family. And I might point out again that my family is very loving and supportive. But I remember my cousin and I were walking around smoking weed, and I remember feeling completely deranged and cut off from reality. Up until this point I had been struggling with symptoms of (what I think was) Pure OCD, narcissism, and sociopathic ways of thinking. It was dreadful. I remember that my eyes were dead, and looking out into the world felt like a never-ending numb dream. My mind would race from psychotic thought to psychotic thought, and I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with me. 

Well, I was with my cousin, Xavier, and we were looking at the clouds or something. And I remember I had this thousand-yard-stare and when Xavier looked at me his eyes widened and he literally exclaimed, out loud‚Äî‚ÄúWhat the fuck....‚Äù I asked him what was wrong, and why he freaked out, and he told me, hesitantly‚Äî‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.... you just look.... sad....‚Äù And at that moment I knew what he was talking about, and from an outside perspective I probably looked like how Andy from Toy Story 2 looked when he told Woody ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play with you anymore...‚Äù I knew that Xavier had seen that same cold, dead stare in my eyes. 

Well on the drive home I was completely deranged in my thinking. And I felt no warmth in my heart. This is kind of hard to explain but I felt as though my eyes were little black slits and my awareness was just barely leaking out of them. I felt dead inside and time seemed to pass by agonizingly slow. 

I had been reading and researching Carl Jung and Jordan Peterson and the concept of the shadow, and part of me had figured that this was part of that process. For some reason I had a bought some shrooms from a friend the day before and I had decided to take them, on a whim really, to see what would happen. What happened though was something I didn‚Äôt expect at all. 

After taking like 2 grams of shrooms I lied down in my bed in agony‚ÄîI think it could be best described as a strong sense of repressed shame, guilt, and evil. Slowly as the effects of the shrooms started to kick in it was as if I was descending slowly into a hell. I was writhing around in my bed in agony, and I was convulsing sporadically. At one point my throat had felt like it tightened up and I my whole body would rapidly thrust back and forth. I had thought that I was possessed by satan himself, and I felt completely deranged, psychotic, and ‚Äúevil.‚Äù I remember looking at pictures of Charles Manson and Ted Bundy and seeing the complete and utter evil that were in their eyes. The terrifying part though was that I had resonated with the energy that was emanating off of their pictures (and especially the evil radiating from their eyes). I rushed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and it was like a scene out of a Joker movie. I looked into my eyes and saw complete, utter evil. And I felt evil in the very core of my being. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and I had felt like I had stepped through a portal and entered an entirely different universe, and the old world that I was familiar with had been stripped away. 

I remember during the shroom trip that at one point I was lying down in my bed and I had experienced this sense of hell‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt torture in the physical sense, but it felt like a black whole of aloneness and nothingness. It absolutely terrified me because it felt as thought that this was my destiny‚Äîto be thrown into this infinite abyss of darkness and aloneness, forever. I remember being at the edge of the abyss and I said out loud softly and defeatedly ‚ÄúGod please have mercy on me.‚Äù And I saw my guitar in the corner and I pleaded to God ‚ÄúGod, please just let me play guitar forever. I‚Äôll go in the pit but please just allow me to play guitar.‚Äù And I had weakedly grabbed my guitar and started to play random notes, and no exaggeration‚Äîthese random notes had grounded me back to reality. It was as if is each note that I played had a transcendent quality about it that profoundly comforted me. The loneliness of hell was minimized every time I had played notes on my guitar. 
And, honestly if my guitar wasn‚Äôt there I don‚Äôt know what I would have done. 

I woke up the next day and I had felt like a person of complete and utter evil. And I had felt like it was part of my identity, if that makes sense. It was if though evil was part of the core of my being, and it terrified me because I couldn‚Äôt shake this feeling off. It was like in the show ‚ÄúDexter‚Äù where he has a feeling like he has a ‚Äòdark passenger‚Äô within him‚Äîan inner urge to kill. I had a feeling similar to this and it terrified me because it wouldn‚Äôt go away. 

I started to recall my entire life, as far back as I could. I was desperately trying to look for times where I was ‚Äúgood‚Äù and had a sense of empathy. However, I felt so negative and hopeless that I didn‚Äôt know if I would ever be able to recall any sense of normalcy, happiness, peace, or identity. 

(I want to note here that I‚Äôve never tortured animals or killed anyone, but I have had a sadistic streak in the past where I‚Äôve felt a sense of satisfaction out of scaring people, winning arguments, manipulating others, and putting ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù people down.)

At this point, I could identify with the choices of people like Elliot Rogers, Ted Bundy, Paul Bernardo, and other ‚Äúdepraved‚Äù and heinous criminals. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not just this sense of suffering that accompanies it, but also this very psychotic and twisted thought process‚Äîand even further, it‚Äôs as if there is a complete possession of the personality, and talking to people in real life is unreal, fake, and disconnected. It‚Äôs not uncommon to talk to someone and have deranged thoughts going through your head like ‚ÄúI could kill you right now. What the fuck. What the fuck is wrong me.‚Äù And this thought process scared me, and the underlying sense of evil beneath it terrified me. Because it seemed as though I was a ‚Äúspawn of satan‚Äù or something‚Äîlike it was my sacred mission here on earth to wreak havoc and to spread misery. It really felt almost as if I was chosen by fate, and I would constantly have thoughts of ‚ÄúWhy me? Why does it have to be me?‚Äù 

I would say that this lasted for about a month and I was walking around in this ‚Äúpsychosis hell‚Äù as would call it. I was desensitized to reality and to society, and I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen. The suffering got so bad at one point that I literally would have rather been tortured to death than to keep existing. I would scramble through YouTube videos to try to find out what was wrong with me, and I think I labeled it down to some kind of personality disorder: multiple personality disorder (with one personality having borderline personality disorder), and malignant narcissism or some variation of NPD. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed but this was just my own inference. 

So, I could go into great detail what the suffering was like but it would take too long for a Reddit post, but I‚Äôll describe what happened and how I almost became a killer.

Well, after a few weeks I would start to get this ‚Äúurge to kill‚Äù and it would come up very strongly to the point where I couldn‚Äôt ignore it or shake it off. And I would impulsively go out for a drive and my body would be buzzing, and one time I was so terrified that I would kill someone that I called my mom and told her I wanted to kill someone. She asked me why and she prayed for me, and honestly the phone call was kind of f‚Äôd up, but it still calmed me down for some reason. 

I remember reading this book called ‚ÄúThe Ancient Wisdom‚Äù and in the book it had a chapter on the concept of Karma. In it had explained that every experience that happens is the result of a past-action coming back full circle. And it also explained that doing actions out of good motive builds positive character and positive life perspective, and doing actions out of good motive builds negative character and negative life perspective. I was desperate and read the rest of the chapter and put it into practice. I started washing the dishes, taking a shower, saying a daily mantra, doing favors for family members, meditating, and I also made a commitment to pick up every single piece of trash that I saw on the ground at work (I‚Äôm a cart puller for a retail store so I‚Äôm out in the parking lot all day.) and I also went on a 4 day fast and have been fasting once a week ever since. 

Well, I remember for a month straight I saw almost no progress, and I was feeling evil, and had no sense of normalcy. But I think after a month or so I started to discover moments of calmness. At first these moments would last about an hour or so and then I would go back to suffering for three days, and then it would come back for an hour and the suffering would come back and it would repeat like that over and over. But every time the calmness would come I would relish in it and be grateful for the sense of relief that would come over me. I would always remember back to that one night with the guitar and it was sort of like I had actually proof that change was possible. It was like ‚ÄúDang, well life is still kind of shitty, but at least it‚Äôs not like how it was that one night.‚Äù 

Even so, I literally felt soulless for about 1-2 months. And I mean that literally. I felt like I had no sense of ‚Äúlight‚Äù or goodness within me, and I would wake up everyday and every say things like ‚ÄúEven though I feel like Ted Bundy, that does not have to be me. I can choose differently.‚Äù And I would literally say things like that for weeks and weeks before I started to slowly see results or improvement. 

Now, for ‚Äúreintegrating into society‚Äù (if you want to call it that) was difficult. It felt like every time I talked to people I would feel foreign and alien, and talking to people and trying to be ‚Äúcivil‚Äù felt like pure cognitive dissonance. There even many times when I would talk to family and friends and feel like a complete empty shell, and I would still do what I could to move forward in integrity with my actions. Even now, I am a lot better, but occasionally I‚Äôll have this ‚Äúinner urge.‚Äù, but now I can see it for what it is, and I‚Äôll feel it and let it run its course. It‚Äôs usually some kind of deeply repressed anger, shame, and guilt. 

The reason I‚Äôm putting this out there is because of the rise of crime and murder that I‚Äôm seeing on the news, and I feel like I have some sort of moral obligation to put my story out there. And I would say that here are some resources, concepts, and activities that I think helped save my life:

‚ÄúLetting Go‚Äù by Dr. David R. Hawkins
YouTube - Dr. Joe Dispenza 
YouTube - Dr. Jordan Peterson
YouTube - Owen Cook and Julien Blanc

-‚ÄúAny event that happens to me is the result of a cause that I set going in the past.‚Äù
-‚ÄúYou are responsible for your thoughts, and you choose how you think.‚Äù
-‚ÄúResults do not come in a day, and you will always reap what you sow.‚Äù
-‚ÄúThe Soul is always there, no matter how dark it gets; no matter how dark the clouds cover the sky, the sun is still shining.‚Äù

-Having a daily routine of responsibility (reality therapy‚ÄîI found that this really helped ground me into the here-and-now of reality)
-Accepting my situation for what it was. ‚ÄúI may never feel normal, but I‚Äôm going to make the most of it‚Äù
-Making it a habit of doing good deeds for the sake of goodness. 
-having a daily ritual of discipline (cold showers every day, reading before bed, fasting once a week, and talking to three random people a day.)

I stopped talking to random people, but I went out every day for 1-2 months and talked to three random people. And I found that facing this fear every single day had profound impacts on the way I interacted with others. I started to pick up on little social cues that I was unable to ‚Äúfeel and intuit‚Äù before. 

Also, to help ‚Äúget in touch with my Soul‚Äù I came to the personal conclusion that: the Soul is the part that appreciates art, music, and nature for its own sake. It can‚Äôt really be explained why one likes music or art, but there is a knowingness that comes when listening to music that and truly enjoying and resonating with it. I think that this transcendent knowingness is part of the Soul. 
I also believe that any kind of genuine laughter is also an aspect of the Soul. Because you can‚Äôt really force a genuine laugh, they just sort‚Äôve happen. And I had trouble laughing for YEARS, and when I found myself laughing at something I really ‚Äútook in‚Äù the moment. After a few weeks it became a lot easier to allow myself to laugh. 

It took about 2 months of wading through hell, but I was able to find a sense of normalcy. But now I make it a point to really put in a good effort, every single day. And yeah some days aren‚Äôt so good, but some days are really peaceful actually, and I‚Äôm thankful for that. 

I truly think that if you are a human, you have the free-will to choose your future circumstances, regardless of your past circumstances. 

üôè thanks for everyone doing their part."

My brother 5 years older than me is disabled he is one of those cases where he is 25 years old but his mind is one of an 8 years old
My brother was never at fault and he never asked to be like this.
I don't have a problem with my brother but my family's attitude about him and me.
I live in a small town and basically everyone knows everyone.
Ever since I was young everybody had high expectations of me "" You are going to take care of your family"" , "" You will take care of your brother"", 
"" You need to try harder for your brother"" ,"" You need...You need...You need"" I have been hearing these things as long as I remember from parents,
Friends, family members , teachers , everybody.
My brother was always creating problems , breaking things , hitting my parents and grandparents sometimes seriously injuring them when he wasn't getting his way, as a result my parents would fight all the time , This has been happening for as long as I can remember.
I always pushed my problems and feelings aside thinking they don't matter . Things got worse when I went for away for University,I have been ""studying"" for 2 years and haven't passed a single subject ...I do  not try at all or do I want to try , I have no motivation to study everyday I am either sitting in my desk or lying in bed , the only times I go out is for groceries or to go to the gym at night knowing nobody else will be there. I also discovered that I suffer from an illness that has no cure ( bones muscles hurt , apnea , headache ) not life threatening but still makes somethings difficult .. Everytime I tried to talk to my parents about my problems they always say I am just acting or things like I should get a girlfriend and that I am making stuff up.I remember when I told family members about what I want to do when I grow up they told me ""No you need to take care of your brother"".
I have noticed that for the past years I have had anger issues...The smallest things make me want to break stuff or hurt someone. I remember one time my mother called me but I didn't want to talk so I hang up on her .. She called 2 more times at the 3rd I just started throwing my phone and smashing for no reason other than that I was angry.
Today the mouse wasn't working properly and after a bit I just smashed it into the wall.
I realise I have problems but I don't know what to do..."

He is feeling tired of this life he‚Äôs been living. Tired of the highs and lows of drug use. Adjusting to the responsibilities of adulthood despite still being a kid. Tired of the, ‚Äúevil thoughts,‚Äù in his head. That stem from drug addiction. Pornography addiction. Confusion about where he stands in this world. Struggles with finding his passion despite a talent for writing and love for music. Questions about what career he will choose one day. How he will function by himself

Independently in the world. What kind of friends will he have. What kind of girls

Will he meet. Will he be forever scarred by the things he‚Äôs seen, done, and felt through

His addiction and battles with mental health? When will he reach his goals.

Does he even know his goals? God and spirituality is still consistent in

His life. But when will he become enlightened? When does god plan

For him to be 100% sober from all drugs and find passion, joy,

And excitement in his life again? He‚Äôs been void positive

Emotions for too long and it‚Äôs because of his decisions

That led up to this very moment in life right now.But how will he get there?

He does not know right now. He knows one day he‚Äôll find out, but in the moment things build up. This is where he stands on the last of 2020. He‚Äôs proud of it, willing to take on the courageous battle, and eager to become somebody he wants to be; despite not feeling like he‚Äôs being

The person he knows he can be in life right now. He will not let that break him down.

But instead inspire him and build him up.

He realizes that instead of just trying to keep it together and continue a destructive lifestyle that numbs him down and brings about pain; he wants to instead live a life where he can feel true emotion, laughter, joy, and excitement about real life things. Instead of these fantasy worlds he‚Äôs grown accustomed to through drugs, alcohol, and addictive behaviors.

He‚Äôs being very lazy right now by not packing his bags for his aunts and getting a shower and getting ready for work. But he really wants to write this letter to himself before he begins all of that. Because he has high hopes that tomorrow he can really change if he allows himself to. If he allows himself to feel all the numbness, boring feelings, and negative ruminations. Because it is only temporary in comparison to the life of joy he can be experiencing once sober. He knows this. This is gods truth.

He wants to make it through the storm. He definitely does not like the feeling of being through the, ‚Äústorm,‚Äù of sobriety. But at this point he is so desperate he is willing to embrace the feeling and in a sense, force himself to stay positive because eventually the positivity and excitement for life will become second nature once he is sober for long enough and starts to make true commitments to his goals (while seeking out psychiatric help alongside).

But God is the most important factor above everything including himself, professionals, and any person or matter in this world. God is the one who shines the light through the storm. He will guide me when I am blinded. He will get me through to the top of the mountain. And show me this vast, beautiful world he has in store for not just me. But for us. The world and universe as a whole. He has so much in plan for us. We must be willing, committed, and excited to follow this plan. And only then shall he, Isaiah, find his way.

This is where he stands on the last day of 2020. Where will he stand on the last day of the next year? Only God knows. But until then, he will keep following his light. In hopes of a brighter day."

They took me off of it and prescribed Effexor instead, and recently added lamictal to take with it.

I haven‚Äôt taken the Effexor at all, and I was prescribed the lamictal just two days ago and haven‚Äôt taken any of it. I know I‚Äôm so stupid for not taking anything, but I‚Äôm just so scared of side effects after my experience with Prozac. 

I‚Äôm TERRIFIED of it permanently altering my brain and my behavior. I‚Äôm so worried that it‚Äôll do more harm than good. 

I‚Äôd rather live a relatively short life being ME, rather than living a longer one being someone different, if that makes sense."
