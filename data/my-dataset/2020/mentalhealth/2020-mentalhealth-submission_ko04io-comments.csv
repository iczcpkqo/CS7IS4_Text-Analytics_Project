¬†But what if we found ourselves stuck to one of those frustrating experiences, reflecting on its consequences, rehearsing its details, and cursing each choice we did, without having the ability to overstep it.

What will be the first idea that jumps to your mind?

Yes, bro! This is one of the ‚ÄúOver-thinking‚Äù symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much. How would you feel if you know that an over-thinking person is spending the whole night thinking how he could have done it otherwise in his day: ¬´ I shouldn‚Äôt have told Sara about what Sandy said! I must have apologized to Omar last month!! I didn‚Äôt do well in the office today!‚Ä¶ Jay didn‚Äôt eat well at dinner, could he be sick? My parents feel shameful because of having a daughter like me! Do I deserve a wife like Natalie? Of course no!! ‚Ä¶¬ª it‚Äôs hard, isn‚Äôt it?...

""I am understanding, caring, and self compassionate. I am proud of where you are right now but know it may have been hard to get to this point and it may be hard to keep going. You got this. We are on the same team.""

This is usually a thought of talking to myself or some other entity of compassion. It usually evokes warm feelings and makes me feel better."

I live with my 35 year old sister across the street from my mom and step dad‚Äôs house. My whole life she has made me like what she likes and when I do like something else she makes fun of me for it. A prime example is when I said I like Back to the Future. Instead of saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into those movies, but we all like different things‚Äù she literally acted disgusted. When I said I liked ripped jeans, she argued that it was because everyone was wearing them. When I said I wanted highlights, she said that it‚Äôs because everyone has them. It wasn‚Äôt and I honestly wanted both of those things and I do not follow the crowd so it was obviously my opinion. Lately she‚Äôs been making me nervous by saying things like ‚Äúwhen your mom moves they‚Äôre gonna make you go with them.‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind living with my mom by my sister makes me feel guilty about living with her. Whenever I try to be talk to my mom she acts like I‚Äôm picking sides. I try to make everyone happy, but with her doing what she does, I can‚Äôt make myself happy. I‚Äôm starting to feel depressed because I lay in bed a lot and I have no energy or happiness to do anything. I am obviously depressed and I still try to offer to help her everyday and she thinks I‚Äôm so happy with her and she complains that I do nothing even though when i help I do something wrong and when I ask she says no. She‚Äôs the one driving me to depression. I honestly hope I can go with my mom but if I even wanna go do something with her I get told things like ‚ÄúI guess you pick her over me.‚Äù My sister also won‚Äôt stop talking about problems she having with Mom, like my mom let her husband borrow her truck because something happened unexpectedly and my sister needed her to take her to the dollar store, she keeps complaining to me that my mom lied. She doesn‚Äôt get I‚Äôm just a kid who doesn‚Äôt wanna know what‚Äôs going on in her, an adult woman‚Äôs life. What should I do and what should I tell her? I don‚Äôt want to make her more nerve wracking than she already is to me."

Reason:
I keep lying to people even when they give me second chances, especially my parents 
I lied to my parents about how i was doing in college and now they have to pay what i have in debt which is more than $70k
I was raised and treated to be the golden boy, to do good, to be responsible and make something out of my life no matter how small. The moment i left the nest i fucked up. I fucked up really bad. My parents just started building their dream house which they were working and saving money for. That‚Äôs 20 years of hard work. Now my debts stand in their way. I basically destroyed their dream. The only way to clear this debt is if I die. That seems like my only option. I‚Äôve only brought shame and hardship to my family. Their health is getting worse because of the bad news and things i keep bringing and doing. I have no choice but to end it. It will free them from the infection that i am."

Her mom died years ago and her dad died this year (not from covid). She has been living with her grandma and aunt ever since I knew her.

&#x200B;

She has been struggling with depression before I knew her and I only knew about it a year ago. I tried everything to support her but I could only do so much because we lived in different states. I even gave her the suicide hotline. At first glance it sounded like it worked because she said it went well and that they would call her the next day as well. The next day though they didn't call back, I told her that she didn't have to wait for them and I encouraged her to call again but I don't think she ever did.

&#x200B;

She tried running away once with her friends because of home life and school. I convinced her not to do it but I think about it a lot. She has also made comments likes. ""I have no purpose in life"" (this was when I gave her the hotline number) and more recently ""I just want to sleep and never wake up. I'm so tired!"" At this point I'm really worried because I feel like I can't do anything and nothing is working. She sometimes complains of body aches with most of them being headaches, stomach pains, and leg pains. It breaks my heart to see that she is stressed to the point of physical pain. 

&#x200B;

Now I don't have depression and I know I don't but I have been stressing knowing she isn't feeling better and I don't know what I'm going to do if she ends up killing herself (I won't follow her if she does but I will of course, be deeply distraught). 

&#x200B;

I already know that I can't do very much because I am an online friend and not physically there. I already know that most of the advice will most likely be ones I already know/tried. I already know that it's not my fight and she can get better by herself. But I don't want to just stand to the side and hope for the best either. I want to help."

ko04io,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ko04io/distinction_between_bipolar_ii_and_dysthymia/,Distinction between Bipolar II and dysthymia?,1,1,1609455928.0,"To clarify, since I don't want to violate any rules here, I am not looking for some Reddit diagnosis. Nor do I think diagnoses and labels are without their problems, but I am about to talk to my GP about switching medication and I need to know how to be able to recognize hypomania if I have experienced it.

For a while, I have been living with depression and medicated for it, which I would say worked reasonably well for a little while maybe? For sure, my meds are not working as they should be by now. A few things led me to question whether I have depression or if it is bipolar depression: 1.) When I last saw my doctor, who asked how my meds were, I told him I thought my meds were only ""working half the time"" because I was experiencing dramatic ups and downs in a fairly predictable cycle. 2.) During a blow-up with my parents where I was overcome by rage, my parents accused me of needing to see a professional for manic depression rather than depression alone. 3.)  A new therapist that I have seen claims she thinks I show more symptoms of bipolar than depression. She bases this on what I have told her about restless 'episodes' where I feel very creative but also highly irritable.Why do I doubt that it could be bipolar disorder? Mainly cause I don't feel grandiosity or elation. I pretty much feel sad most/all of the time but occasionally I will have days where instead of sad I feel really irritable and creative (almost like an acid trip?). I also tend to embellish my experiences so I worry that my therapist could be interpreting my words which could be inflated or overstated, as I am an emotional person obviously.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this and I am terribly sorry to anyone who is bugged by this post, but I suppose I am asking the question *how can I know if I am experiencing a 'manic period'? How do I know if it is more than depression? Could these odd swings be caused by my current medication or extenuating circumstances? What is the next step in finding out which it is?*

Edit 1: A few extra details for those who might want it. \*On nights where I am able to sleep, I constantly have dreams of me causing an irrational scene in front of my family, where I blow up into a rage and scare them. I have done this before in real life and it terrifies me the idea that I could harm them or make them feel threatened. I don't really know what these dreams mean but I know that they manifest fear I have of this 'angry side.' \*My family has a strong medical history with persistent depression and a weaker medical history with bipolar disorder (at least one member on my dad's side had it?) \*My therapist also contends it could be bipolar disorder because of my obsession with certain things, my proclivity to self-sabotage, and the fact I have expressed that medication may not be for me because I sometimes like this 'angry side' of me for the creativity it brings out of me."
