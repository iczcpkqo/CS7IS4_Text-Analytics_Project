Yes, bro! This is one of the ‚ÄúOver-thinking‚Äù symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much.

Her mom died years ago and her dad died this year (not from covid). She has been living with her grandma and aunt ever since I knew her.

&#x200B;

She has been struggling with depression before I knew her and I only knew about it a year ago. I tried everything to support her but I could only do so much because we lived in different states. I even gave her the suicide hotline. At first glance it sounded like it worked because she said it went well and that they would call her the next day as well. The next day though they didn't call back, I told her that she didn't have to wait for them and I encouraged her to call again but I don't think she ever did.

&#x200B;

She tried running away once with her friends because of home life and school. I convinced her not to do it but I think about it a lot. She has also made comments likes. ""I have no purpose in life"" (this was when I gave her the hotline number) and more recently ""I just want to sleep and never wake up. I'm so tired!"" At this point I'm really worried because I feel like I can't do anything and nothing is working. She sometimes complains of body aches with most of them being headaches, stomach pains, and leg pains. It breaks my heart to see that she is stressed to the point of physical pain. 

&#x200B;

Now I don't have depression and I know I don't but I have been stressing knowing she isn't feeling better and I don't know what I'm going to do if she ends up killing herself (I won't follow her if she does but I will of course, be deeply distraught). 

&#x200B;

I already know that I can't do very much because I am an online friend and not physically there. I already know that most of the advice will most likely be ones I already know/tried. I already know that it's not my fight and she can get better by herself. But I don't want to just stand to the side and hope for the best either. I want to help."

Nor do I think diagnoses and labels are without their problems, but I am about to talk to my GP about switching medication and I need to know how to be able to recognize hypomania if I have experienced it.

For a while, I have been living with depression and medicated for it, which I would say worked reasonably well for a little while maybe? For sure, my meds are not working as they should be by now. A few things led me to question whether I have depression or if it is bipolar depression: 1.) When I last saw my doctor, who asked how my meds were, I told him I thought my meds were only ""working half the time"" because I was experiencing dramatic ups and downs in a fairly predictable cycle. 2.) During a blow-up with my parents where I was overcome by rage, my parents accused me of needing to see a professional for manic depression rather than depression alone. 3.)  A new therapist that I have seen claims she thinks I show more symptoms of bipolar than depression. She bases this on what I have told her about restless 'episodes' where I feel very creative but also highly irritable.Why do I doubt that it could be bipolar disorder? Mainly cause I don't feel grandiosity or elation. I pretty much feel sad most/all of the time but occasionally I will have days where instead of sad I feel really irritable and creative (almost like an acid trip?). I also tend to embellish my experiences so I worry that my therapist could be interpreting my words which could be inflated or overstated, as I am an emotional person obviously.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this and I am terribly sorry to anyone who is bugged by this post, but I suppose I am asking the question *how can I know if I am experiencing a 'manic period'? How do I know if it is more than depression? Could these odd swings be caused by my current medication or extenuating circumstances? What is the next step in finding out which it is?*

Edit 1: A few extra details for those who might want it. \*On nights where I am able to sleep, I constantly have dreams of me causing an irrational scene in front of my family, where I blow up into a rage and scare them. I have done this before in real life and it terrifies me the idea that I could harm them or make them feel threatened. I don't really know what these dreams mean but I know that they manifest fear I have of this 'angry side.' \*My family has a strong medical history with persistent depression and a weaker medical history with bipolar disorder (at least one member on my dad's side had it?) \*My therapist also contends it could be bipolar disorder because of my obsession with certain things, my proclivity to self-sabotage, and the fact I have expressed that medication may not be for me because I sometimes like this 'angry side' of me for the creativity it brings out of me."

I'm a first year at a london uni btw. But yeah I feel like I'm not doing well in my friendships. Some advice?,3,4,1609455415.0,"Hi r/mentalhealth.

Before I launch off, this is a very very long post (took me like 1 and a half hours lol) and would probably take you 20 minutes to digest so I would say brace urself if ur really determined to help out. This post discusses my successes and failures in making friends this term. But most importantly my worries about whether I will be able to hold onto my current friends. The post also addresses my social awkwardness and why I think I'm this way. If ur going to give advice, please read the whole thing so you can understand my situation better. And if you click by this thread, please take to help me. I would really appreciate it. Just 20 mins of ur day. Ty

Let's begin.

I'm kinda paranoid about whether I've made solid friends or not during my first semester. It feels weird to call them friends since they feel nothing like my old ones who I have a very close connection to (I've never been the best at making friends so only really had two good friends during a levels). While I did feel a bit depressed during my A levels, I realize quality > quantity. I could ofc not care about making friends but if I don't have these interactions, I won't make a good doctor since my professional identity won't develop. Also being lonely might take a toll on my studies (I hate it so much why does it do that?).

At uni, I've been struggling between quality vs quantity. But tbh both quality and quantity in my friendships have been lacking because of online learning and I live at home. Might be because of COVID but I still want to explore deeper. So I only really made some connections with 2 coursemates and maybe a third one (I'll discuss more about him but I feel like it's a very loose connection). No flatemates since I live at home. But I will be moving into a student flat at some point.

Me and friend 1 were both really eager to be friends. He reached out to me on the Imperial college london freshers app. A couple of days later, we even had a zoom call. It was taking off very well. This was 2 weeks before uni started. We still talk to each other regularly over whatsapp and have some solid conversations. We have at least one common interest so there's a talking point. I really think I will have a good connection with friend 1 over time.

Friend 2 has so many shared interests. We are basically clones of one another. He's a few years above me so I'm slightly intimidated by that. And he also has his own friend circle so I kinda feel like an intruder but I feel like it should go well. We got lots to talk about but there's still a problem. I'll come back to that.

'Friend' 3 doesn't have that many similar interests to me apart from maybe one. We mostly talk about work in our conversations and occasionally about interests and other stuff. I kind of feel inferior to him because he's very outgoing, good in social situations and isn't socially awkward like me. I'm basically the opposite as I'm kind of awkward in social settings. I feel like such an awesome guy would never want to be friends with me after finding out what I'm truly like so I feel like this friendship is doomed. He's good in small talk, he's professional but I'm not.

My attitude towards friendships so far has been going for quality rather than quantity so I've not reached out to millions of people just those 3 really. Friend number 2, I made a brave attempt to add him and explain that we have like the same games so we should play together sometime. Friend no 3 wanted to DM me something (after chatting on the main groupchat) so I had an excuse to have him on my contacts. And because he was there, we could start chatting properly.

Now onto the problems. Like I said. I'm not experienced at making friends at all. I can talk but I'm a bit socially anxious. But I will always face social situations. I forced myself to go to online fresher meetings and public speaking society. I almost got over my anxiety in social situations (after finding out they went better than I thought) but I haven't had any physical interactions with coursemates since start of uni (once freshers was over). Lack of social interactions has made me fall back into being socially anxious again but I still force myself to speak up in online class and I try to speak for a long time whenever I give feedback to others.

Now let's go back to when I said I'm a bit rubbish at making friends. Ok so I add them, ask how they're doing, their interests.How do I know how often I should text them?How do I avoid coming across as desperate when making friends? Like sometimes I'll genuinely want to talk to them but I fear that if I keep initiating too many conversations, they'll think I'm desperate. But at the same time, I don't want to text them once in the blue moon since they'll think I don't care nowAlso should I always initiate conversations or wait for them to start one sometimes? Because with friends 2 and 3, it's always me. Friend 1 and me do it equally so there's no issues but I still do a bit more than friend 1.Friend 3 did it maybe 2 times but pretty much I always initiate the convo.I always initiate the convo with friend 2.Now am I being paranoid for thinking that they're not as interested if I always have to start the conversation?I have to admit, they are receptive in these conversations and the convos always take off so it's not like they dislike me right?

So the thing is, with my current best friend, I never have to worry about these things. I can text him whenever I want and as many times as I want. I don't even need to do small talk to initiate conversations. I can just ask him 'hey what do you think of mario bros?' and that won't weird him out.

But with my uni 'friends', I can't do these things. It will seem random if I ask questions like that. I can't text whenever I want. I can't text them as much as I want.If I text them all the time, I'll come across as needy or trying too hard which will put them off. But how on earth can I deepen a connection if I'm supposed to limit how much I talk to them?How does friendship even work anymore? I literally can't understand it.

Another problem is that I can't really do stuff together with my uni friends because we can't meet in person due to COVID so we can't go the cinema or have a coffee together or any of those activities which builds friendship.That being said, me and friend 2 have plans to play together online in our video game so that should do something.

Another thing about friend 2. He seems another one of those sociable dudes who have lots of friends. So I feel like he's going to look down at me if he ever discovers my social awkwardness. He can talk about stuff easily but I can't. He might be annoyed by me then.

Also I was planning to have a study together with friend 3 but I'm worried that we'll do all these things together then he will ditch me when face to face teaching resumes. Why? Because of the way I am. That will hurt a lot. Trying to get close to someone and then get ditched. That's why I'm reluctant to invest in friend 3 since ik the friendship will probably fall apart. That's why I'm also reluctant to contact him a lot. And friend 2 to some extent. I want to put in effort to see a friendship which won't end. Not for someone to meet me in real life and think I'm a dork.

I've also failed when I tried to make friends with 2 other people. A girl added me when I asked about a flat groupchat and I felt we talked pretty well. The next day I asked how she's been keeping and she doesn't reply even though she read the message.So I assume she's not interested and never contact her again. I feel like if I did, then she would think I'm desperate especially when she seems disinterested.

Another guy I thought I got on well with. We had some really good conversations so I thought why not add this person? Seems like a solid dude. I was really excited for what I thought would be a great potential friend but he was like the other guy. Reads my messages and never replies. I said hi how are u doing? When I added him. Didn't reply. Funny thing is that he doesn't ignore me on the anime group chat and we had solid convos there. So I sent him another DM, it was read and ignored again. And I'm pretty sure he knows it's me and not some random person. I'm so confused about him. I've been thinking of cutting contact there too but surely I must be mistaken?

Now a few things about me before I close off. When I say I'm socially awkward, I mean that I'm not very good at small talk and feel fake when I say 'how are you' when I couldn't care less. Only for my closest friends. But then I wouldn't need small talk in the first place. If I genuinely feel like asking it, I will. Only if I don't need to fake it and I mean it. This is why small talk sucks. You pretend to care about strangers.I'm good at deep talk. I'm good when we have extremely similar interests we are both passionate about.But here's the thing about me. I lack common knowledge and have no interest in mainstream things like politics or the inbetweeners or any Netflix shows that everyone talks about. Understandably this makes it hard to find talking points with the average person. So I'm rather limited to who I can connect with. I don't want to pretend to be interested in main stream things so why talk to people who are?I'm interested in a few video games, history, the dark web and medicine ofc.Also another thing about me which makes me suffer in conversations. I have an extremely thin skin. Like if someone calls me an idiot (even though I'm pretty smart actually), I will internalize that insult and get offended and mad. I will get mad not because of the insult really but because why would someone say something uncalledfor for no reason at all? Also how can someone call you an idiot if they have no proof of it? Do they know ur IQ? Have they done an IQ test on you? This is the types of things that I think about when insulted.Now the issue is I'm very scared of being insulted because I'm not good at witty comebacks. I feel like if i say ' please don't say that, it's hurtful' everyone will think I'm a softy. I'm not scared of the insult itself really. Just my social awkwardness gets pronounced when I get insulted because I have no idea how to react to it. I wish there was a manual on it lol.This links to my social awkwardness a lot. I try to find the nicest way to say things and make sure there's no way I can insult someone by what I say. Because I don't want to be insulted back because I can't handle it.So this means I take longer to think about what I want to say. Even if there's an easy way to say something, I'll have a million suggestions whizzing through my mind and this is why I usually jumble my words when I speak sometimes. All because I want to say stuff in the best way that won't hurt anyone.I've tried to combat this by speaking my mind on a few occasions. I've got myself in trouble due to this on internet forums with everyone thinking I'm childish.

If I could start a convo with 'hi can we talk about history?' I wouldn't be socially awkward at all. Because we can skip the small talk and get into the deep talk which I'm not bad in. But apparently society thinks u must be abnormal if u wish to skip small talk. Anyway that was a mini rant.

I feel like if COVID didn't happen, I would have maintained the social skills I developed and was working hard to improve. But ofc if you can't meet anyone anymore, it's going to suffer and plummet all the way down. But then again without COVID I might have still been screwed since I didn't make much friends in A levels.

Let me quickly discuss my old friends. In A levels, there was a bunch of new people coming to join our year group. But I already had a very good friend from lower years so he was one of my good friends too for A levels and even now. The other was a new person but I liked him for the way he was. Like me, he hates small talk. It was perfect since I met another person who doesn't mind if I start with deep talk. And he was a mutual friend too with my other.I did socialise with others too during A levels but they were never anything more than acquaintances. Kind of like what my uni friends are now. Acquintances not friends.

Well done if you got this far. I hope you read it thoroughly since I really need help but I'm waiting to see if I can get good advice here on reddit. I would seek therapy I guess but idk whether I need it or not. I think all I need is a simple change in mindset. Furthermore, idk where i can find therapists. Also they will probably charge money which I don't have. My parents would just laugh if i asked them about therapy. Therapy isn't really on my plate unless it's free.

Also one more question: Is there any point in reaching out to more people over groupchats? It seems everyone's so distant with COVID even with each other. Nobody in my class groupchat has even bothered to get to know one another. But when there were small group tasks, it felt pretty nice talking to actual people for once. This only happened twice tho. Not enough times for them to pick up on how lame I am.

I'm sure that situational factors aid this most, however after living with depression since childhood with a constant mask on, I feel I have finally moved passed this chronic phase in my life. I am still trying to articulate how I was able to do it, but I think overall the most profound thing was my dad dying 2 years ago. Strangely it was the most painful thing I have ever been through in my life, I miss him daily, but something in me shifted and I started to feel like if I can let my dad go, then I can lose anything in my life and survive and be okay, also that if I can overcome that then I can overcome any challenge or fear and I feel a deep sense of being free now.

It's very weird and a part of me feels it's too good to be true because I lived with feeling low and disconnected from others all my life. But I wanted to write this to share for anyone else who has been through the motions of depression, particularly from childhood, that there is light at the end of the deep, dark tunnel and that we need to make active decisions to chose things for ourselves that are helpful or pleasurable, because we can have good days and enjoy life again. <3 Sending love and hopefulness for 2021 in these unprecedented times!"

I have managed to find myself in a nice place in life thanks to various factors. My suicidal thoughts are gone. But now I feel I've lost my plan B, the always present exit, and my anxiety symptoms have worsened significantly. They are caused by some events which would have made me nervous in the past as well, just not as much. This permanent state of anxiety takes a toll on these factors which saved my life. I just cannot fail, if I do, I will relapse into depression.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Any advice is welcome."

1.  I have pretty severe but varying depression and I was diagnosed with dysthymia.  I often think of killing myself and how I would do it but I feel confident that I would never act on it.  I had a bad episode a few months ago that prompted me to start therapy again. I can't say I've had a particularly difficult life and struggle with the idea of being depressed because I feel like I have no reason to be depressed.  I do this despite knowing that its an imbalance but I can't help it.
2. I work in a creative industry and have little to no creative drive until im in the thick of a project that determines my livelihood.  Independently, I am rarely artistically motivated which has been a problem that has grown more problematic within the last few years.  Overall I feel indifferent to almost everything.  This leads to some pretty heavy self destructive thinking because I see colleagues becoming better and better as I remain stale.
3.  I have an incredibly hard time focusing.  Even writing this, I'm thinking about a million other things.   My mind feels like its in a haze and I constantly forget things.  I have a hard time completing tasks and its fucking up my career, my relationship and life overall.
4. Occasionally I tend to fixate on one thing - can go hours without drinking water, eating etc - psychiatrist described it as a manic episode but not sure I agree

I have tried so many things to try and deal with these issues  so ill just go through what I've tried and maybe someone can recommend something.

Physical Activities 

* Tried running in the mornings (stopped doing because of weather)
* meditation (inconsistent on this)
* yoga (inconsistent on this)

Lifestyle Changes

* improved sleeping habits  (recently got worse)
* Therapy bi weekly (last 4-5 months)
* psychiatrist monthly (last 3 months)
* Trying to lean a language (failing miserably)

Dietary Changes

* Mostly Vegetarian diet- only occasionally eating fish
* Gluten free for celiac
* way less drinking - used to be a few 6 packs a week.  Now about  one or two 6 packs a month
* Improved eating overall - lost about 25lbs in a few months
* Multivitamins

Medicinal approaches (self prescribed)

* Nootropics
* Kratom
* Mushrooms (this was the best performer but didnt try it long enough because I ran out)

Medicinal Approaches (psychiatrist prescribed)

* Buproprion XL (low dose then increased dosage - felt absolutely nothing)
* Adderall ( was concerned about taking it regularly)
* Pristiq (about 3 months in - not feeling very different)
* Concerta 18mg ( few weeks in - same)
* 15mg L-Methylfolate ( yeh nothin)

So these are all things I've tried over the last few years and I really haven't found anything that helps much or that I notice offers much improvement so I'm just frustrated.  I'm not really sure what to do.  I'm pretty tired of feeling like this and I really don't know whats wrong with me so just wondering if anyone out there could recommend anything or offer any suggestions.  I appreciate any help."
knzhkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knzhkq/today_marks_a_decade_of_me_being_depressed/,Today marks a decade of me being depressed,2,5,1609453665.0,"On paper, I am doing very well in life. I have a loving girlfriend and a great career path set out for me. 

I have always felt lonely. Even if I open up to people, I feel lonely. It did get worse over the years after my mother and my grandfather died. They were really close to me. 

On top of that, I have this self hatred. I despise every aspect about myself. I used to cut my face. Thankfully, I have stopped that. Lately, it has increased a lot that I have started starving myself and smoking. I think I'm anorexic. 

My family doesn't believe in mental health problems. My mother did, unlike my father. I went for counselling once but it was not helpful. 

Can someone help me? I'm scared that I will be depressed and lonely all my life. 

PS: Sorry about the straightforward post. I really don't know how to get over this. Everyone keeps telling me it's a phase, but I don't know about that."
knzemu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knzemu/i_dont_want_this/,I don¬¥t want this,1,3,1609453378.0,"So it¬¥s December 31.  10:53pm  


I¬¥m sick of it, sick of living my life like I do. I feel like puking and crying but as always nothing comes and my sadness shifts to nihilistic depression. At 12pm is the deadline for the easiest paper of my collegetime but I just can¬¥t do it. I fucking can¬¥t...   
I sit alone in my apartment because I wanted to because I hate the whole time from Christmas till New Years and yet I hate it to be alone right now, I hate that I wont send in the paper I hate the urge to try to do and feel better I hate being alone I hate I hate I hate. I do so much stuff I hate and never do anything that I really want or like. Well obviously that¬¥s not true but I can¬¥t see it right now in reality. In fact I am doing much better then just a year ago or even then my whole life but I am tired to fight that shit. I don¬¥t want to do any (para)suicidal stuff and I wont because I learnt because I became better but still why is it so hard? I thought at sometime the turningpoint was supposed to show up....All I do at home is gaming laying around listen to music and masturbating for that kick. I can¬¥t even watch shows or read because my thoughts are too distracting...or sleep for that matter...  
The thing is I have people in my life. I have a job where I am respected I have some friends and I am happy with my body I have hobbys and and I apparently have no problem getting laid but fuck man why can¬¥t I use all this shit to feel good? Why do I have these Impulses to fuck myself up? I am the one that pushes the dagger in my back...   
For fucks sake the only goal in my life is to be happy not even crazy like just like normal stuff appreciate a good time and dont fall into the bad enjoying being liked fall in love and shit.   
I want to be better I really do I really fucking do...  
Fuck I am like an addict addicted to doing nothing and ignoring my life .  
And everytime I do things I get the urge to relapse.  
Fuck me if I just knew it will get better I think I could do it. And knowing like believe it in my heart kinda shit.  
It has to get better right? I mean it already did but It hast to get good not just better. Just a good fucking live....why does it seem so fucking impossible?  
So what do I do? I guess I will keep on pushing like I always did because I am way to stubborn to give up but I need to try to be less stubborn and accept change into my life.   
I don¬¥t believe 2021 will get magically better but I can change it to be better. And I don¬¥t mean the big fucking C I can handle that shit I just can¬¥t handle myself and how to treat myself with respect lmao  


Sorry if you read that far this was just for me but I needed it to be somewhere out of my head and I don¬¥t feel like using my little bool rn  
But you know what? I will get better I don¬¥t let that asshat of life control me. I¬¥ll promise you that !  
I need that to be the future me I¬¥m imagineing.   


Oh and sorry for my english lol It¬¥s my second language   


Happy 2021 to you"

knyw7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knyw7g/am_i_the_problem/,Am I The Problem,2,3,1609451608.0,"For as long as I can remember, I have had consistently been in bad relationships. Friends, family, romantic relationships. The only family I talk to are my parents, because my entire family is genuinely racist (this I had no problem with). I end up ending all my friendships for one reason or another. A few examples are:

\-My best friend in high school said he was bored hanging out with me because I'm too depressed and that's all I talk about

\-Several friend of my past friends have dating my ex's or other people I was very interested in.

\-I lived with a friend and she would always blame her anxiety on me because I would walk around my room or I cleaned too loud. 

\-I lived with another friend and her bf and her bf would constantly have people over (including a guy that lead me on for months) during lockdown. When I told her I didn't feel safe, she told me her bf didn't care and can do what he wants. 

\-I lost a lot of friends defending my best friend who was hurt by our mutual friend sleeping with her abuser. (A lot of those friends sided with the mutual friend).

\-Most recently, I ended a friendship with someone who would make fun of me behind my back when I'd talk about being suicidal. 

I have reacted in ways that are less than favorable from being hurt by my friends. Things like having meltdowns, saying hurtful things, being defensive, moving out without notice and just blocking them without saying a word. I hold grudges for a long time. I've talked to therapists and psychiatrists and really gave them all the details to get an opinion. They always coddle me and sugar coat things, probably because I have ptsd. I just want a straight answer. Every time I end a friendship I think of that quote that's like ""if you keep having toxic relationships, you're the problem."" My therapist told me I end up in these toxic relationships, because I look for people to prove my core belief that I'm not good enough. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm the problem, and I don't know how to fix it. I feel so hopeless. I have a few really good friends I love and they're very honest about what I've done wrong, but they've also said ultimately it's not my fault. I've also have had old friends and exes that have contacted me to apologize. But I've also had old friends talk about how awful I am with each other after I end friendships. I just want an unbiased outsider look. If anyone has any advice please let me know, I want to be better."

well i mean this year start doesnt seem this good for me. I am tired of everything i haven't ate or drank water properly in like 4 days :) and it lowkey feels good starving, it feels good as my insides churn and ache. I hate this. My family blatantly calls me psychopath because i sought therapy last year.  My heart aches i am so empty these days... i kissed my love for first time yesterday... but all of this feels horrible... i have decided to starve myself and die. The food no matter how good it is , makes me sick, i cant drink water without puking. Not only my mind my body rejects food. I am so tired of being looked with narrow eyes, i danced today for first time in three months and i felt nobody enjoyed my presence. I designed dumb charades today and my sister kept saying no one is having fun while jumping and laughing around (she was serious when she said) When i laughed she said i was overreacting and how stupid i was, My mum didn't say anything to her... when i said she was toxic ... so my mother called me 'badtemeez' means disrespectful and saying i am like this ...leave me... i said i will go to my room because i felt bad but they didn't listen.... everyone just felt like staring at me saying i ruin the fun.... they called me a psychopath in front of my relatives... i got angry and left... Every time i go i can feel their eyes staring at me... they consistently call me it was better when i was a kid and how sweet i was... they refuse to acknowledge my deteriorating mental health... i am a bit chubby and i am lowkey proud of my body and its marks and all i love my body... my love made me love it ( nothing sexual i just feel if someone loves me and thinks i am special then why can't i?) and they say i do that(not eat) to lose weight ....hell no!!!! i don't eat anything because i feel empty and dead i don't wanna live anymore... sometimes he (my bf) makes me feel maybe its not so bad to live, maybe this time will pass... we dreamt that after all this i will get to live with him in a live-in and be with him and work hard for my love but.... it's unbearable sometimes... i don't understand the age respect factors that are put in ... i cant respect a person just because they are older than me i refuse to respect a person who ruins my self worth...Maybe i will die maybe not... but not right now maybe later...BUT i wanna fulfil my promise to him... maybe i should try a bit longer.... but i don't know if i am capable or i am worth saving

knyach,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/knyach/making_new_years_resolutions_stick_is_tough/,"Making new year's resolutions stick is tough; change is hard because we're fighting habits built up over years. Rather than struggling, be aware of when your habits arise and treat them with kindness until they pass",1,1,1609449488.0,"There‚Äôs an old Zen joke: a guy is riding a horse down a road at breakneck speed, barely holding on. A person standing by the side of the road watching him scream past shouts to him, ""where are you going?"" He says, ""I don‚Äôt know, ask the horse."" Like most Zen jokes its more of a thinker than laugh out loud funny; the insight here is that we are both the rider and the horse - the rider is our conscious choices, the horse is our habits. 

To let go of our harmful habits we need to train our awareness - stopping for a few minutes each day, focusing on our breath, our bodies, our thoughts, our feelings. But just as important is training ourselves to recognize the habit when it arises. Its key not to see that habit as the enemy - when we fight ourselves we tend to lose a lot of the time. Just notice it, be aware of it and breath for a few moments, allowing it to pass.

If we care for our habit energy like a friend, listening to what it‚Äôs telling us, not treating ourselves like a battlefield or running but shining the light of awareness and allowing that awareness to transform our habits, we can start to water the seeds of joy in our life. And with enough awareness and enough time, the horse will slow down, stop and maybe even let you take the reigns.

The thing is, I don't feel like I belong to any kind of community since I'm not diagnosed. I don't feel like I get to announce my struggles bcuz of that. I know not everyone believes in self-diagnosis, but, I'm very certain and sure of what I have exactly. But even tho I experience all of the symptoms for the disorders that I mentioned above, I still feel sort of, fake (?) bcuz, again, I don't have an official diagnosis. The other day I saw this post, on instagram, this girl who's a recovered anorexic, saying she ""killed herself for a diagnosis"" which is exactly what I'm doing, wanting to be ""sick enough"" to get diagnosed. Logically, a healthy person would not want to be sick. But yeah... That's how my mind works.
I just wanna know if anyone else experiences the same feeling of invalidity, or has a similar story? 

Maybe this post can help someone who's struggling the same way, who knows?"

I've heard of one man who jumped off a bridge who, during his fall, realized that he could fix most of his problems, except for the fact that he just jumped off a bridge.

Even in my own life, I've gravitated toward drastic solutions like quitting school and living in a van when the pressure became too much. But, when that pressure is lifted, that seems incredibly drastic and impulsive.

My question is, why does the mind do this? Is there a word for this phenomenon?"
kny3zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kny3zt/my_mental_health_is_debilitating_and_sometimes_i/,"My mental health is debilitating, and sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to even function as a fully-grown man",2,4,1609448876.0,"At times, I feel worthless, empty. I begin to doubt my own abilities, my own skills, and I question whether I really matter. I slowly start to lose motivation, and I find myself being sloppy in concentrating and sometimes in even doing simple tasks. Other times, my body feels so anxious, I begin to warm up, and I began to visualize scenarios that would never happen. I begin to lose touch with reality, and irrational fears, mainly concerning technology although sometimes other things, start to pop up. When these fears flare up, that's when I can't function. I start becoming short of breath, my face is red, and I feel like I'm going insane. Even when I know my fears are stupid and don't make sense, I feel compelled to believe them and its like 99.9% of me is going crazy while the 0.01% is just there, watching, whispering to me that what Im worrying about doesnt make sense, yet I can't seem to believe it. This sometimes ties in with my paranoid thoughts, where I can't trust anybody, and in some occasions, even my family members..                 

The worst part about all of this is that I know what I'm capable of, and there are certain periods of time, although rarely, where I feel like a grandiose being and I can accomplish anything. But this is, again rare, and this feeling of feeling ""somewhat good about myself"" is immediately followed by falling into an abyss of mental struggle and worry. 

&#x200B;

I haven't been able to get as much work I needed to get done as possible, and I'm starting to worry. My grades are slowly dropping, and compared to last year, I am not doing as well as I want to. I haven't been able to concentrate, and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. 

I'm scared, not just for my mental health, but for the future me. I've always been somewhat of an anxious, paranoid person, because I sort of believe that these feelings, when really minor, are natural. But over the years, my mental health has spiraled out of control, and it's only getting worse. I don't remember it being this debilitating, even during my younger years. What if I grow up to be someone crazy, or don't live very long because of my mental health? During the heat of a moment, I had cut myself on the arm to stop my paranoia and worrying, but I stopped after realizing what was going on. 

I've tried to connect with god, become more spiritual, but even during my prayers I can't seem to calm down. 

I don't know what to do.."
