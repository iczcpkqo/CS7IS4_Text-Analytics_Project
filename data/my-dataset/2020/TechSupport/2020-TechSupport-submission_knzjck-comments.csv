OS: Win10 v1909 (if that matters)

I'm trying to google a solution but can't find anything remotely related to the problem.  What's the term of this monitor problem called?  The top left corner has a square block of pixels on the top left corner and it seems to always be a lighter/blurry representation of what's supposed to be there.  


Already tried:

\- restarting computer

\- updating GPU

\- replugging both cables

\- tried cables with different monitors

\- tried monitor with different (working) cables

\- tried different ports on the GPU

\- tapping sides of monitor

Even if it's broken beyond repair, what would you call this?"

The specific files I copied over to my hard drive are ""Program Files"", ""Program Files x86"", and ""Steam"". Steam was like updating and just decided to dump all the update files on my desktop too, and whenever I try to install a steam game it just says I can create a new directory in one of my other drives, or I can Install on C:\\Users\\(My name)\\Desktop.

The computer behaves as though a mouse wheel was constantly scrolling down. So, If I'm in Firefox, the zoom plummets to 30%, the minimum.

There are applications where I can use the mouse's wheel to scroll up and down. There are other applications where it's as though there's constantly a mouse wheel scrolling down. In those situations, I can flick a few times on the mouse wheel to go up be then it's immediately overtaken by constant wheel down.

In firefox, while not touching the CTRL key, the mouse wheel scroll up and down is normal.

In one application, it behaves as though I was scrolling to the right.

This is a Win10 PC with up to date OS. The problem started today.

Coincidentally, my USB wired mouse died because of a frayed wire. It's as if the dying mouse infected the computer. My best guess is that there's a corruption in the registry.

Edit: Solved.

There was a connected to the computer a USB dongle for a wireless accessory. I don't remember what. Maybe a mouse I used to use. When I removed the dongle, the problem went away. Maybe there's a  mouse in a box somewhere with a wheel wedged in some position. Or a keyboard with a key pressed."

My Predator helios 300 laptop (PH317-53-7777) started to make a clicking noise about a week ago. I was able to see that it was the fan not spinning. (I'm mechanically inclined and have built gaming PCs for over 10 years). I could blow on it, get it to spin and the noise went away. I knew the fan would have to be replaced (it's out of warranty). So I started shopping around and ordered the fan (still not here).  


Fast forward to yesterday, I come in from work and I go to turn it on and it went into a boot loop. The predator screen will show up and than it blacks out and reboots. Sometimes it will say preparing system restore and than crash. So I tried to his f2 and get into bios and when I do, it literally still crashes 3-4 seconds later and reboots.  


Today I come home and Asurion (extended warranty that I've had BAD expereinces with and want to avoid sending it to them) had sent the box for me to send in for service. I decided to see if it would start. Pressed power, it came on, the fan made a little noise but it went straight to the windows login screen. I was able to log-on, checked event viewer for anything out of the ordinary just incase. Nothing. The fan started it's usual noise so I opened up the build in temp monitor (predator something, not even 100% sure cause I can't get it on again). Saw the cpu was at 40c and system was 30c, pretty much telling me what I know. The fan isn't spinning the way it's supposed too. It was on the auto setting, for shits and giggles I clicked the button to turn them on fully. It INSTANTLY shutdown and now is back in the bootloop. Will not get to windows.  


I dont know enough about laptops, is there perhaps a failsafe kicking in because the fan is not spinning/restricted? Is there a sensor for that? Could it be a power issue? The fans draw too much and kill it? Could it be a motherboard issue for the same reason? can't send the signal?   


I would love to avoid sending this back to Asurion, since they love to just ""replace"" with what they consider similar and this is a gaming laptop with a 1660ti, their similar would be a hp that can't run minecraft :D :D"

So this machine was using an Asus z390e gaming motherboard and an Alienware Aurora R7 1080ti up until recently. I was running updates on my machine and when in the restarting phase it never finished this. After about an hour I held the power button to restart it, booted it up and it started to boot loop. Every 5-7 seconds the machine would shut down and restart unless I pulled power or flipped the switch. I tested a PSU, spare RAM, and removed the GPU and it still had this issue. So at this point I replaced my motherboard because this was my thought and the suggestion of a Microcenter employee. After replacing this the machine would then work as normal (I reinstalled Windows 10 64bit) but the 1080ti would not be recognized in the bios or device manager. At that point it seemed my gpu had gone with the mobo. I managed to get a 3070 today and after installing it the same issue persists. The gpu has two red LEDs light up by the 2x 8 pin connectors for power, but nothing is detected in bios or device manager no matter what I do.

It has a Intel core i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2208 Mhz. My GPU is  Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with the latest version 460.89. 

My problem with my laptop currently is that it randomly restarts itself with no error messages showing up. I have done somethings in order to get to the root of the problem with no real solutions. The problem began on December 9, 2020. There was an update to my graphic card and after running the update my pc restarts randomly. I found it odd and check what happen and notice that the Nvidia update was available again for installation. I redid the installation and my pc didn't restart. a Day later on the 10th of December my pc randomly restarts while playing league of legends. I assume it was something to do with the update and check again but this time the installation was not available. The problems with randomly restarting the continue. On the 15th of December, there was another update to the Graphic card, I assume that it was done in order to fix the problems and that more people were experiencing similar things. At last, it did not help and I decided to do a few things.  For one I notice that my GPU was overheating aka reaching temps of around 75-80 degrees.  This was never the case before the update to the graphic card. Here is a list of the current things I have done.\\

1. I have disabled automatic Windows restart 

2. I have tried using sfc /scannow, but it says that there are no corrupted files, the same thing happens with DISM. 

3. I have tried the startup repair toolfrom the recovery options.

4. I have restored Windows 10 keeping and without keeping my personal files (again using recovery settings).

5. I have completely cleared my hard drive and resintalled Windows 10 with a clean installation from a USB. 

6. I have updated all drivers and BIOS 

7. Open up my laptop and did a cleaning of the fans and ventilation vents. I clean out a lot of stuff that might have been causing the overheating. Currently, my Gpu sets at around 40 degrees when not in any game and jump to about 60 while playing league and when playing a game with good graphic demands like sea of thieves it reaches temps of 72-74.

Usually it woud only restart about 1 time a day, however today it started to restart pretty fast. Just today I have noticed it restarts 5 times.  If anyone is able to help me, i would appreciate the help. Thank you so much for your time and if you need more information, let me know how to get it and ill post it here. Thank you again"

I usually averaged around 120-180 fps in Valorant before but ever since i cleared my laptop, I have been averaging 40-80 fps with a lot of frame drops, I also noticed that the high performance and Asus recommended options in my power plan are missing. I tried to get them back by using command prompt and typing the code I found online but the power plans remain missing. I have tried changing my nvidia settings, my valorant settings and everything but the game is just unplayable for me right now. Also my laptop has been heating up quite alot lately, If you guys have any solutions please help. Thank you."

My mother has Xfinity, and they (Xfinity) want to change out the cable box for a new one. But on the saved recordings there are videos of my brother's wake/funeral/stuff that was on the news for him.

Does anyone know of ANY way to either pull those off/burn them somewhere.

I got everything installed to mint condition. Everything plugged in in the right places, everything should’ve been working fine. When I hit the power button to start the pc, it turns on for a split second with the rgb on my cpu cooler, and gpu all turning on, and the fans rotating. That’s until they all shut off not even a half a second later. I’ve tried removing ram, gpu, unplugging everything, plugging back in, removing everything in the case down to the barebones and putting everything back in. Nothing. The thing is, you can turn off the psu after hitting the power button, and it’ll turn on again and turn off half a second later. No idea what’s happening."
