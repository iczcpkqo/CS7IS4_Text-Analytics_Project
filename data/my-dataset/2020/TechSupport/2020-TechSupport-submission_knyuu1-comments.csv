OS: Win10 v1909 (if that matters)

I'm trying to google a solution but can't find anything remotely related to the problem.  What's the term of this monitor problem called?  The top left corner has a square block of pixels on the top left corner and it seems to always be a lighter/blurry representation of what's supposed to be there.  


Already tried:

\- restarting computer

\- updating GPU

\- replugging both cables

\- tried cables with different monitors

\- tried monitor with different (working) cables

\- tried different ports on the GPU

\- tapping sides of monitor

Even if it's broken beyond repair, what would you call this?"

The specific files I copied over to my hard drive are ""Program Files"", ""Program Files x86"", and ""Steam"". Steam was like updating and just decided to dump all the update files on my desktop too, and whenever I try to install a steam game it just says I can create a new directory in one of my other drives, or I can Install on C:\\Users\\(My name)\\Desktop.

The computer behaves as though a mouse wheel was constantly scrolling down. So, If I'm in Firefox, the zoom plummets to 30%, the minimum.

There are applications where I can use the mouse's wheel to scroll up and down. There are other applications where it's as though there's constantly a mouse wheel scrolling down. In those situations, I can flick a few times on the mouse wheel to go up be then it's immediately overtaken by constant wheel down.

In firefox, while not touching the CTRL key, the mouse wheel scroll up and down is normal.

In one application, it behaves as though I was scrolling to the right.

This is a Win10 PC with up to date OS. The problem started today.

Coincidentally, my USB wired mouse died because of a frayed wire. It's as if the dying mouse infected the computer. My best guess is that there's a corruption in the registry.

Edit: Solved.

There was a connected to the computer a USB dongle for a wireless accessory. I don't remember what. Maybe a mouse I used to use. When I removed the dongle, the problem went away. Maybe there's a  mouse in a box somewhere with a wheel wedged in some position. Or a keyboard with a key pressed."

My Predator helios 300 laptop (PH317-53-7777) started to make a clicking noise about a week ago. I was able to see that it was the fan not spinning. (I'm mechanically inclined and have built gaming PCs for over 10 years). I could blow on it, get it to spin and the noise went away. I knew the fan would have to be replaced (it's out of warranty). So I started shopping around and ordered the fan (still not here).  


Fast forward to yesterday, I come in from work and I go to turn it on and it went into a boot loop. The predator screen will show up and than it blacks out and reboots. Sometimes it will say preparing system restore and than crash. So I tried to his f2 and get into bios and when I do, it literally still crashes 3-4 seconds later and reboots.  


Today I come home and Asurion (extended warranty that I've had BAD expereinces with and want to avoid sending it to them) had sent the box for me to send in for service. I decided to see if it would start. Pressed power, it came on, the fan made a little noise but it went straight to the windows login screen. I was able to log-on, checked event viewer for anything out of the ordinary just incase. Nothing. The fan started it's usual noise so I opened up the build in temp monitor (predator something, not even 100% sure cause I can't get it on again). Saw the cpu was at 40c and system was 30c, pretty much telling me what I know. The fan isn't spinning the way it's supposed too. It was on the auto setting, for shits and giggles I clicked the button to turn them on fully. It INSTANTLY shutdown and now is back in the bootloop. Will not get to windows.  


I dont know enough about laptops, is there perhaps a failsafe kicking in because the fan is not spinning/restricted? Is there a sensor for that? Could it be a power issue? The fans draw too much and kill it? Could it be a motherboard issue for the same reason? can't send the signal?   


I would love to avoid sending this back to Asurion, since they love to just ""replace"" with what they consider similar and this is a gaming laptop with a 1660ti, their similar would be a hp that can't run minecraft :D :D"

So this machine was using an Asus z390e gaming motherboard and an Alienware Aurora R7 1080ti up until recently. I was running updates on my machine and when in the restarting phase it never finished this. After about an hour I held the power button to restart it, booted it up and it started to boot loop. Every 5-7 seconds the machine would shut down and restart unless I pulled power or flipped the switch. I tested a PSU, spare RAM, and removed the GPU and it still had this issue. So at this point I replaced my motherboard because this was my thought and the suggestion of a Microcenter employee. After replacing this the machine would then work as normal (I reinstalled Windows 10 64bit) but the 1080ti would not be recognized in the bios or device manager. At that point it seemed my gpu had gone with the mobo. I managed to get a 3070 today and after installing it the same issue persists. The gpu has two red LEDs light up by the 2x 8 pin connectors for power, but nothing is detected in bios or device manager no matter what I do.

It has a Intel core i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2208 Mhz. My GPU is  Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with the latest version 460.89. 

My problem with my laptop currently is that it randomly restarts itself with no error messages showing up. I have done somethings in order to get to the root of the problem with no real solutions. The problem began on December 9, 2020. There was an update to my graphic card and after running the update my pc restarts randomly. I found it odd and check what happen and notice that the Nvidia update was available again for installation. I redid the installation and my pc didn't restart. a Day later on the 10th of December my pc randomly restarts while playing league of legends. I assume it was something to do with the update and check again but this time the installation was not available. The problems with randomly restarting the continue. On the 15th of December, there was another update to the Graphic card, I assume that it was done in order to fix the problems and that more people were experiencing similar things. At last, it did not help and I decided to do a few things.  For one I notice that my GPU was overheating aka reaching temps of around 75-80 degrees.  This was never the case before the update to the graphic card. Here is a list of the current things I have done.\\

1. I have disabled automatic Windows restart 

2. I have tried using sfc /scannow, but it says that there are no corrupted files, the same thing happens with DISM. 

3. I have tried the startup repair toolfrom the recovery options.

4. I have restored Windows 10 keeping and without keeping my personal files (again using recovery settings).

5. I have completely cleared my hard drive and resintalled Windows 10 with a clean installation from a USB. 

6. I have updated all drivers and BIOS 

7. Open up my laptop and did a cleaning of the fans and ventilation vents. I clean out a lot of stuff that might have been causing the overheating. Currently, my Gpu sets at around 40 degrees when not in any game and jump to about 60 while playing league and when playing a game with good graphic demands like sea of thieves it reaches temps of 72-74.

Usually it woud only restart about 1 time a day, however today it started to restart pretty fast. Just today I have noticed it restarts 5 times.  If anyone is able to help me, i would appreciate the help. Thank you so much for your time and if you need more information, let me know how to get it and ill post it here. Thank you again"

Crashes while ""Preparing Automatic Repair"". Crashes on boot to WinPE. Crashes on boot to Windows 10 USB boot drive. I have actually gotten it to load Windows a couple of times, but it crashes after a second or 2. No BSOD, just straight to reboot. CPU temp looks great (39.5°C CPU Idle, 55°C CPU 100%)

**History:** A neighbor brought over a brand new PC to have me try to troubleshoot it, and I have been completely stumped so far. The original problem was that the system would crash/reboot as he tried to install programs (other than Windows 10), or generally if he tried to do much of anything. On someone else's advice, he returned/replaced with the motherboard. After installing all the drivers that were missing, I was able to get PassMark BurnInTest installed and got 2 successful 15-minute runs in (testing CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD). I thought all was well and good, but decided to make a 3rd BurnInTest run, but it crashed. Ever since that point, I can no longer get to windows to check Event Viewer or anything. I am able to boot to MemTest86+ and UltimateBootCD (UBCD) programs.

**System Details:**

* Ryzen 9 3900XT
* ASRock B550 Phantom Gaming 4
* AMD Radeon RX 5700XT
* EVGA B5 750W
* 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD
* 2x8GB Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3200

**Things I've (or my neighbor) Tried:**

* Reinstall Windows 10 (neighbor)
* Motherboard swap (neighbor)
* PassMark BurnInTest (2x 15-min runs - No errors)
* Remove/swap around RAM sticks
* MemTest86+ (No errors)
* BIOS Update
* Different PSU
* Different GPU
* Remove CPU and visually check for damage/bent pins (No visible damage)
* UBCD StressCPU (No errors after 4 hours)
* UBCD SSD check (Verify-Write-Verify - no errors)
* Different RAM
* Different M.2 drive

Issues:

This PC came with issues straight out of the gate a few years ago. First, I had to reseat everything to get it to post. Then it was all good for a about a year, but then the original PSU failed. Replaced with the Corsair one and it was all good for another year or so until I added an SSD. It's a Samsung 860 EVO 1tb. I cloned the original HDD to the SSD and everything was fine for not even a month. I tried to boot one day and it was stuck in a boot loop where it would try to repair windows, but nothing would work. Not even using installation media on a flash drive would work to repair the booting issue. So I had to reformat. Obviously I was concerned that the drive was bad, so I ran a bunch of tests on it and everything checked out. 

Then, a few months later, I lost the task bar... seriously explorer just wouldn't open. I was able to launch things with task manager, but that was annoying. It eventually came back and my computer was normal for about a week before the GPU seemingly failed... at the same time as the boot issue came back. 

This time, I went into full diagnostic mode. I took out the GPU and the computer posted with integrated graphics and went into the same previous boot loop. Could not repair it at all. I was able to do a system restore, but it did not fix the issue. The firs time this happened, it was so soon that there was not even a restore point.

The GPU is completely unrecognized in my other computer. It must be dead. There are no codes or boot issues- the computer simply acts like its not there and boots up using the integrated graphics. Doesn't come up in device manager, no fans, nothing. . .

I put the ram stick into my other computer and just played some games and used the computer normally for a few hours. No issues. I put a ram stick from my working computer into the Cyberpower PC and it did not fix the boot issue.

So I am assuming I can just go ahead and reformat it again and get who knows how much more life out of this thing, but I would much rather fix this issue. I am extremely bummed about the GPU failure because it is a terrible time to try and buy a GPU. It is also really strange that the boot loop started at the same time as a GPU failure. Is there any chance that the computer bricked the GPU? Or the GPU failing causing the boot loop? Just a coincidence? Could the SSD be faulty after all?

At this point, I am just going to reformat it, install all my software and games, and then clone the drive to one of the HDDs as a backup. This way I can just keep restoring it from the cloned HDD and not have to use another computer to clone the drive. Pretty lame but not sure what else to do.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
