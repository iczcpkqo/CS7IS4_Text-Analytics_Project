OS: Win10 v1909 (if that matters)

I'm trying to google a solution but can't find anything remotely related to the problem.  What's the term of this monitor problem called?  The top left corner has a square block of pixels on the top left corner and it seems to always be a lighter/blurry representation of what's supposed to be there.  


Already tried:

\- restarting computer

\- updating GPU

\- replugging both cables

\- tried cables with different monitors

\- tried monitor with different (working) cables

\- tried different ports on the GPU

\- tapping sides of monitor

&#x200B;

Even if it's broken beyond repair, what would you call this?"

I got my new SSD and I cloned my hard drive with windows onto it, and then wiped my hard drive. At that point, everything was fine, but then I decided to start moving things from my SSD back onto the hard drive. And I really fucked things up. Some apps are saying they can't find files, all my steam games don't have thumbnails, I need to reinstall a lot of my steam games and a whole bunch of bullshit. The specific files I copied over to my hard drive are ""Program Files"", ""Program Files x86"", and ""Steam"". Steam was like updating and just decided to dump all the update files on my desktop too, and whenever I try to install a steam game it just says I can create a new directory in one of my other drives, or I can Install on C:\\Users\\(My name)\\Desktop. I am a nervous wreck right now and this is a pretty shitty way of spending new year's eve. If any kind soul has any amount of advice, it would be greatly appreciated. If you want to even talk further DM me and I can give you my discord. Again, thank you."

And, I get the same behavior when the mouse is disconnected. I can even witness the problem in another application where I disconnect the keyboard but keep the mouse.

The computer behaves as though a mouse wheel was constantly scrolling down. So, If I'm in Firefox, the zoom plummets to 30%, the minimum.

There are applications where I can use the mouse's wheel to scroll up and down. There are other applications where it's as though there's constantly a mouse wheel scrolling down. In those situations, I can flick a few times on the mouse wheel to go up be then it's immediately overtaken by constant wheel down.

In firefox, while not touching the CTRL key, the mouse wheel scroll up and down is normal.

In one application, it behaves as though I was scrolling to the right.

This is a Win10 PC with up to date OS. The problem started today.

Coincidentally, my USB wired mouse died because of a frayed wire. It's as if the dying mouse infected the computer. My best guess is that there's a corruption in the registry.

Edit: Solved.

There was a connected to the computer a USB dongle for a wireless accessory. I don't remember what. Maybe a mouse I used to use. When I removed the dongle, the problem went away. Maybe there's a  mouse in a box somewhere with a wheel wedged in some position. Or a keyboard with a key pressed."

After 5 calls I got it settled but had to get a Docsis 3.1 router. So I ordered a Motorola SB8600. Then I bought a TP-Link ax3000 router to go with it. Well the modem says it’s got connectivity and the WiFi signal stays up. But the router keeps saying no internet. I’ve tried the trouble shooting through TP-Link. My thought is to order a new modem, then if that doesn’t work return and get a new router, or am I being stupid and this is a cable company issue? My wife has now been dealing with our kids at home with no streaming or online anything because at best she gets 25 minutes of internet before it’s gone again... any help appreciated? Especially if you can work magic! Lol"

To start off, a happy new year to everyone! 

So i bought a new laptop and it  got deliverd today.


Upon opening it i updated the drivers , optimised the games i play to high performance and set my energyplan to high performance.

Now when i started my game it ran : 120fps on Ultra - 3 minutes later and the Fps drops to 30

I restarted and tried again, to the same result.

Any ideas what might cause this? 

Ive googled and seen a lot of people have this issue on asus laptops, and its really disheartening for a new fresh out of the box laptop. ( due to space and other reasons I can't have a pc)


These are the specs:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800H
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
RAM: 16GB
Storage: 1TB SSD
Display: 17.3-inch, 1920 x 1080, 120Hz

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

 It worked fine or a few weeks, until the following happened:  
 I booted the computer and got the BIOS F12 splash screen, instead of the BIOS F14e  splash screen.  Then it rebooted again gave me an error message like  ""Main bios corrupted, restoring from backup.""  It rebooted again and and had no splash screen from then on. 

Whenever I boot the computer, it's give it's extremely slow and after a while crashes, whether I use MacOS or Ubuntu.

I wanted to re-flash the BOISt back to F12, but encountered the following problems:

 \-  I only get the first BIOS screen, (regardless of whether I use the primary or secondary BIOS).  
 \- I can't access any setting not on this screen  
 \- All USB ports don't work until the OS loads, so I can't flash the BIOS from USB.   
 \- I don't have a CD/DVD Drive that is working.  
 \- I don't have MS Windows, so I can't use the \\@BIOS utility  
 \- MacOS and Ubuntu boot from the SATA drive, but I don't know of a BIOS flashing utility for them.  
 \- When I hit the <End> key during the POST or the <F8> key in BIOS setup menu, nothing happens.  
 

Is there anything I can do to re-flash my BIOS?"

Now with a Chromebook on the network as well and it's been disconnecting maybe 3-4 times a day, followed by a few minutes of just waiting for the network to reappear and connect to the internet.

It's not the worst inconvenience, but it sucks if you're streaming video and have to wait a few minutes. Not much different than a commercial I guess, but it's still something that shouldn't be happening I don't think. I've tried completely restarting the Xfinity modem, but that didn't seem to make much of a difference. It still happens, and you just have to wait for the network to reappear.."
