OS: Win10 v1909 (if that matters)

I'm trying to google a solution but can't find anything remotely related to the problem.  What's the term of this monitor problem called?  The top left corner has a square block of pixels on the top left corner and it seems to always be a lighter/blurry representation of what's supposed to be there.  


Already tried:

\- restarting computer

\- updating GPU

\- replugging both cables

\- tried cables with different monitors

\- tried monitor with different (working) cables

\- tried different ports on the GPU

\- tapping sides of monitor

Even if it's broken beyond repair, what would you call this?"
