    "text": "I've been bringing up some memories for years now that would just get pushed away.  Eventually my step father tried to apologize but after this he refused to talk about anything.  He's never apologized in his life so I thought this was a change.  \n\nHowever as more memories came flooding in he refused to talk about them. He would scold me for bringing anything up stating that he will \"NEVER talk about the past again\" He actually started that message off with \"you've ripped the band aid off again\"... a big issue is that I'm the one who was hurt but he was trying to control  me and not allow me to discuss the past at all.\n\nI recorded this video after my mom joined in his silence and refused to answer my calls or reply,  It does feel good to stand up for myself.  It was VERY hard at first. I often felt like I was crazy and betraying my mom...even though she wasn't doing much in terms of helping me walk through this.  After I sent it I started having flashbacks to him yelling at me and me cowering into a ball crying as a child.\n\nI still have some moments of fear and sad times but overall I'm doing much better.  I don't think I would've gotten to this point without therapy.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck-VqTmOigQ",

He came out of it very lucky to be alive after having what is called a widow maker heart attack and was defibrillated twice. He laughed right through it and we all thought he sailed through it to live another day but in the recent months he has been showing classic signs of serious mental trauma. He has started having panic attacks and has become very nervous about doing the most simple things like going to work and seeing people. I guess my family and my father just want to hear how other people coped. Doesn\u2019t have to be advice.. could even be a story of someone you know who has dealt with this sort of situation. \n\nWhoever you are, please tell your story :)",

It gets so bad that I see a spider and immediately have a panic attack and cant move. \n\nMy husband and I semi recently moved into an older house and theres been lots of spiders. We did a bug bomb and then had to deal with finding curled up dead spiders around the house for awhile so until we got everything cleaned up, I was still in panic mode.\n\nSince being here, I've been trying really hard to overcome my fear and have been trying to kill them on my own, but only if their small. But it's like the spiders are now out to get me. I had one jump on me in the shower and that sent me running out of the shower screaming. Every since that I've been so anxious about just walking to a different room in the house. \n\nJust as my anxiety had calmed down, I'm in the bathroom today and a big one, like a daddy long legs or whatever crawled across my hand. My husband cant come home and kill it, I ran out of the room but now I have to go get ready for work but theres a freaking super spider in there and I cant even bring myself to step into the master bedroom knowing theres a spider in the master bathroom. \n\nI've thought of going to therapy to help get rid of my arachnophobia but I've heard that therapists will use exposure to \"cure\" someone of arachnophobia and I cant do that. I'm not even sure if it's true but I dont want to find out. \n\nSo any advice on how to get over this?

    "text": "Ok. So here goes. And sorry in advance for the wall of text. But i just feel the need to get this out, somewhere. Basically i'm in a relationship, soon reaching the 5 year mark and everything is basically... fucked. (She is 33F, and i'm a male just a few weeks from 33.) She is depressed, and i'm getting there, dynamics are toxic and our daily life is stressful. The thing that mostly bothers me is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven before all this happened, she had a habit of not using a regular trashcan to get rid of garbage. Instead we just put them in the kitchen sink, and later she would make a \"garbage bag\" out of them. I was ok with this, even if it wasn't the way i was used to \"managing garbage logistics\". Then she started making these bag less and less frequently... A year later the other kitchen sink is always full of trash, the pile going as high as the dish drying cabinet. Right now at least the other sink is empty so i can do the dishes, but even that isn't always the case. The kitchen floor and the living room floor are also full of old magazines. There are paths on the side and in front of the couch that we can walk on. The bathroom has gotten the same treatment (except a whole lot worse), there is a path surrounded by garbage all the way from the door to the corner where the shower is. The piles are knee high. You can just barely operate when going to the bathroom and shower. The bathroom sink has been basically clogged from the start of the year. I get it to drain just a little by using a self-made tool consisting of two plastic straws taped together, but that doesn't seem to work anymore either. I should open the sink up, but there is no space to do that. Obviously i can't call someone to open it up either, because how the apartment has been for over a year now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever i bring up the possibility of me just cleaning everything up, exhausted of looking at my apartment that has become a garbage dump, she becomes angered and agitated. Threatening to break my computer and having a mental breakdown. I believe her, so i wont and can't do anything. I don't want to make matters worse. She demands that SHE NEEDS TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT and that she will get to doing it at some point if i am nicer to her for long enough. I'm trying my best but this all is having an effect on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, right now, things have been getting to me lately (for a multitude of reasons.) and i have been feeling pretty down because of it. Yesterday she asked me how i was feeling and i just said it again: \"Having to watch these piles of trash is making me feel sad and disgusted, and pretty hopeless. It's not right that you are forcing me STILL to just not do anything to them when i could.\" And yeah, this didn't come out with a kind or a quiet tone so we have an argument over it. And she was rude towards me and i got irritated and i talked shit back to her. And of course soon after that she says that she is tired and that she isn't going to do the trash (one or a couple of trash bags) like she was planning on doing before. And this morning she is like, \"i could have made one trash bag yesterday. But now after taking a shower, i'm not going do anything to the trash for a few days. Besides, i'm sure as hell not going to reward your shitty behavior.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd once again i know there is zero point in talking to her, saying anything back is only going to make things worse. The best i can do to just wait and be kind to her. But it's getting really hard. Things being as worse as they are. To top it all off our anniversary is 2 weeks from now. And she has previously said that if we don't get engaged then(Been together for 5 years at that point), our relationship is through. And... i just don't see HOW THE FUCK i could get to a place where that is even remotely possible. This sick situation has continued for like a year now, and my feelings have changed towards her. Everything is just getting so fucking hard.I ACTUALLY WISH i didn't love her at all anymore but i still do, even if that is miles away from what it was even a month ago. If i look at the pictures of past happier times and it makes me cry every time. I feel deeply responsible for ruining our relationship and her metal health to the state where both are today. She has said many times that i owe her to try harder. That only after i can say i have given my all that i can quit the relationship. I sorta agree. But i have also been in a shitty state mentally for many months now. I try to be better, i really do. Like i try to stop making mistakes but i ALWAYS eventually make one. Sometimes the time between fuck-ups is days, sometimes weeks. All i know for certain is, at some point, it's going to happen. And when it does she usually reacts badly to it, and then i probably react badly to that. It's a never ending cycle. Every time things get a little worse and she feels bad. And i feel even more guilty of everything and more sad, tired and hopeless. And then I HAVE TO live with the repercussions of that also. Just \"get over it\" and smile or else there's another argument because i have a \"frown\" on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just chaos. And i feel helpless. Like a abused dog just waiting for the next eventual kick. And the worst thing is that at most times i feel like i can't really even do anything to stop it. Like for example. As i said the bathroom is full of trash, but right now the other kitchen sink is actually trash free because she actually cleaned it up a week ago. But even then she had to bitch EVERY time a small plastic bag came up with bio in it. Saying that the bags where not sealed tight enough. Okay i agree, that was the case. So i made double sure to tighten every bio filled bag from that day onward. Stuff i realized pretty soon: There is probably more \"too loosely sealed\" bags in the other sink. Now i (stupidly) decided to be honest with her and say it today, even telling her my own plan on how i could fix it: I could carefully move some of the trash to the other sink, and go through these \"poorly sealed\" bags, tighten em' up and maybe put them in inside additional bags. And after that but every one back to where they were so that when she finally gets around to cleaning the sink up, every bag would be more sanitized. Well she said that she doesn't trust me to do that and then the trash pile in the sink will be unstable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what exactly can i do to fix this mistake? NOTHING. The only thing i can do is mentally prepare myself for the bitching that is going to come that particular day. As i said, i feel like a dog just waiting for the next kick. IT'S COMING. And once again. I am aware that i am the person who has brought us to this point. But i'm just starting to reach my limit. Like this is too much. I feel lost and hopeless. How the hell can i get myself to a point where i \"take our relationship\" to the next level, when my feelings for her are the lowest they have every been? How can i do that, knowing that we are in a hell, and that we are probably going to be in this hell for a long time going forward? Like i should be happy about something like that and i just doesn't feel right in any level, except maybe in some weird \"i owe her that\"-kinda way. So i should take this relationship forward with the premise of things getting better after that, even if i feel like shit right now? I feel these negative things too often, and every time the best options is to bottle them up. Cause every time i take them out something bad happens. Either they come out wrong or i ruin her mood with them. It's a type of back and forth, if she isn't happy, i'm ok. And when she might otherwise be \"ok\", i bring her down with my bullshit. I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI marked this as \"Venting\" because i couldn't make this post any smaller. But i need help.",

And while I find that in many situations and with many people I can have a good amount of empathy, I do find that it kind of drops off if their behaviour is too incomprehensible to me. It's something I would like to work on, but it honestly isn't a priority at the moment - I have other personality traits that are far more pathological.\n\nI don't think it's just a question of severity as I feel like my mental health problems are pretty severe, like I can deal with people being totally non functional and very distressed, it's just the stuff that gets a bit wackier that makes it hard for me to connect to the people I'm finding in these servers. Also, while I am totally up for people speculating about what disorders they have, I do think it's best etiquette to state if that's the case, and, you know, be sensible with the speculation, not just assuming you have every new disorder you encounter to be edgy or something.\n\nBut yeah, I would like to find a place to chat to other adults with mental health problems about those problems in an intelligent way but also about other things too. \n\nFor reference I'm a 28 year old gay man and I have BPD (diagnosed) with I suspect AvPD and a dash of narcissism thrown in. \n\nI have actually found one server with relatable people in but it is small and not very active. There's also another server where the problems I have with it aren't the ones I've mentioned above but the communication style of the people in there is all off for me, but I don't want to say any more than that because I honestly think it's actually a result of some of the characteristics of the disorder and although I don't communicate in that way I can totally see how that could end up happening, and I guess it makes me sad to see a server \\*full\\* of people who communicate in that way. \n\nI realise that I'm essentially looking for people that are mentally ill in exactly the same aspects as I am, even if the actual disorder they have is different. And I guess it's understandable that mental health discord servers would be populated by people who are the most impeded not only in functioning but specifically in communication, as most others probably manage to get more of their social needs met in other places. \n\nAnd I'm sorry if I come across as a dick here, as I say, I try to understand and accept people despite differences but there are certain things that grind my gears and while I'm not gonna be straight up mean to those people it does mean I might want to choose to spend my time talking to people who I consider to be more compatible with me",

    "text": "Okay firstly i gotta say that this is extreemly difficult for me to post. And I've been thinking about if I wanna do it or not for a really long time. It's going to be a long text. Sorry about that.\n\n\nSo I'll start with my parents (im currently 26) ... When I was a kid I was pretty much alone. My father aways travelled so he can work,since we struggled with money. My mother was staying home. I'll save you the details,but back in the days my mother cheated on my dad. He was heartbroken but forgave her since he loved her too much that happened when I was like 2-3 years old. Later on when I was 11 years old she cheated on him with the same guy while he was away. He found out,and started cheating on her.I was left to live alone in my dad's house. While my auntie and grandpa took care of me. At one point he came back home. He couldn't work anymore since he had problems with his legs. And he was an \nalcoholic. But don't get me wrong. He wasn't a violent,drunk swine. He was just a broken man. And when he was drunk all I saw was regret and suffering. My mother was a real POS tho. She was abusive,not so much physicly but mentaly. My dad developed a problem with his eyes. Since we struggled with money. He drank methanol. I was bullied at school. He used to come to my school and help me with that. We created a bond. But ofc. He died when I was 15.So enough about my backstory.\n\nQuick forward to my state rn:\nI struggle with severe anixiety,paranoia and anger issues. I live with my girlfriend,with 2 cats and a dog (we both love animals). Altough I have anger issues I would never hurt any of them. I just bang and scream alot. I have social anixiety as well. Which is making it so difficult for me to get a job. I don't have one rn. And my girl is working to get our bills paid. I know that this is pathetic,and I hate myself everyday for it. My goals in life are to become a streamer,a youtuber or a tiktoker. So I can make money without having to deal with irl people. (Trust me I tried to break out. interacting with people irl isn't a thing for me).I also have a severe lack of motivation and Its really hard for me to even get out of bed. I play video games when I manage to do it. I usually even play them with my girl. But recently she made me choose between her and the video games. She is conviced that the anger issues are coming from the video games I play. But I know that this is not the case. The video games are triggering a problem with me. Its like having a headache and advicing me.to cut my head off. And that's a real problem for me since I wanted to be a streamer/youtuber/tiktoker. And without playing video games. I basicly have to quit my dream.\n\nI tried going on a therapy,but the doctors are POS. Last time I went there they wanted to make me addicted to antidepressants so they can farm money off me. I don't even struggle with depression. I don't want to kill myself or anything. I want to live a happy and long life. But that's the sad truth about pharmacy. \n\nI really need help and I don't know what to do. If you read all that. Thank you!",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've (26) been suffering from some form of social anxiety for several years now, basically my \"symptoms\" are stuff like:\n\n* not knowing what to say in social situations\n* thinking a lot about past social situations (\"did I say sth stupid?\"...)\n* having the feeling I'm not interesting and funny enough (even with close friends)\n* feeling pressure to \"put on a good performance\" every time I meet up with friends\n* becoming  quite panicky when I feel like I run out of things to say or the  conversation could stall (this is also my fear before talking to  people/friends)\n* ...\n\nI'm also a bit introverted and oftentimes seem like a rather serious and quiet person (not always).\n\nNow to my question:  \nI'll move to a new city where I don't know anyone, and I'll be working from home at least 50% of the time.  \nGiven  my struggles with social situations mentioned above, do you think it  would be a good idea to choose flat sharing over living alone? I was  thinking this could be some kind of exposure therapy (I already feel  uncomfortable just thinking about running into flatmates in the kitchen  several times a day and not knowing if I should talk and what to talk  about haha).\n\nI really wouldn't mind getting out of my comfort zone if this could help me long \u2013 term.  \nThe alternative would be to get my own apartment (rent would be roughly the same), and trying to meet new people in other ways.\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "Hi, I'm your average job-hunting joe trying to finish college. In my graduate school or book publishing, the last semester is a half-year internship. Last year, I didn't have many problems to find a position not too far from home, but this year I've almost exhausted the local options.\n\nI had a lot riding on that one internship offer where at last I would have had employment close by, and yet I've been rejected. I'm probably taking it too personally and failing at looking at it in a positive light like the stoics teach us (I might eventually, not now), but the fact is the motivation to keep up the search is far from its highest.\n\nOnly a couple of small local houses remain, and then I'll have to keep applying for jobs in Capital City\u2122 , some other places on the other side of the country or even abroad. This is the \"plan B\" situation, and I'm not liking it one bit. As stupid or weak as it may sound, I'm on the verge of flat-out giving up.\n\nAll these years I've telling myself \"unemployment? not for me\" but also \"working far from home? not for me\" and as Mark Manson wrote in \"Subtle Art of not Giving a F\", that feeling of entitlement bit me in the buttocks and caused a lot of distress.\n\nI do not feel like \"facing\" or \"confronting\" or \"standing up\". I've had glimpses of \"courage\" in my life, but always fell back into disappointment and questions such as \"what for?\" \"for who's sake?\".\n\nI'm nearing 28, few friends (one very dear is on the other side of the globe), six-years-too-late in my last year of college, and a whole bunch of self-respect and self-worth issues, plus nihilism.\n\nA mental health specialist understood my unwillingness to be looking for some manual job and suggested I look for part-time if not full-time employment in local book stores or public libraries. And yet I'm afraid this would only distract me that internship-chasing. The problem is, if I don't find an internship soon, I don't know how I'll have the mental capacity to be looking for a proper \"job\" afterwards. My mind might end up in the ditch for the years to come.\n\nThank you for reading, I'll try to write at least two cover letters today, Capital City (TM) be damned.\n\nAny advice, criticism, sharing your own experience is appreciated, thank you.\n\nHave a good day, and stay safe.",

    "text": "I have rewritten this post so many times and I am just going to get to the point. I(f17) struggle with anxiety, depression, adhd, ptsd and god knows what else- not all to the same severity but I had a troubling upbringing and they all very much run in the family. Despite this I refuse to voice any kind of despair I feel. It has been like this since I was younger- when my siblings and I went through something traumatic I always made sure I was the one to hold them while they cried and to be strong. (Its what I needed during those times :( )Every so often I would lay on the living room carpet and sob quietly while they slept. My coping mechanism for the longest time has been denial. \"If I refuse to acknowledge it, it doesn\u2019t exist\". When I go through depressive episodes to the point of suicidal thoughts or paranoia so intense that I keep myself up 72 hours, this only exists to me. I don\u2019t write about it in my journal, or share it with someone I know I can trust. Because then I have to accept that this is an actual thing I am going through. The problem is it\u2019s the same with my loved ones, when they come to me with things they\u2019re going through I shut down. I don\u2019t want to believe there are things hurting them that badly- so I struggle to listen and show sympathy. This goes on and occasionally when something especially awful happens I can\u2019t bottle it up anymore and I walk outside and sob just thinking to myself \"I\u2019m gonna die, I\u2019m gonna die\". Therapy does not work either because I refuse to share that there is any kind of issue out of my control. It has gone on for so long that I have even started to confuse myself- my personality is so drastically different with my friends and family. I remember having a conversation with someone after finding out some very traumatic news- I was giggling and joking like nothing was wrong. Not even a \"I gotta run\" or \"can we talk later? Something came up\" it was like nothing happened. As soon as he hung up I immediately broke down. I felt so disgusted and disingenuous. Like I dont deserve to be upset.\nIt all leads me to second guess my emotions like; \u201cdo I actually feel this way or did I just not get enough sleep?\u201d \"Is this something actually wrong or am I just searching for a reason to be upset?\" Ofc It is good to take a step back from your situation and evaluate what is in your control that could\u2019ve changed the outcome, but everyone goes through tough times. And I want to be able to talk about that with people who care. I want to confront everything so I can start the healing process :( \n\n\nI know this is a common thing and hearing about how others learned to open up might help me! Any advice would be so so greatly appreciated.\n(sry for long post)",

And this is all caused by what I would consider a traumatic event.\n\nTw: depression, suicidal thoughts\n\nSome context: It started when I lost a job. I lost the job because \"no one likes you\"... That's what I was told. I thought I was doing fine. My customers never showed any signs of hating me and my coworkers hadn't made it clear to me either. There were a slew of other things that led up to this moment that made it so awful for me, but needless to say, this had been the tipping point. I had a complete meltdown.\n\nI cried in my car for hours, barely managing to text a friend whom I trusted, cueing him in to my mental state. He realized what was happening - that my thoughts were spiraling into the more dangerous ones, and so he came and he found me. I could barely speak. We talked about going to the hospital, but eventually my mom - who I'd been ignoring - convinced me to go to her house instead.\n\nOnce there I cried for a bit more and then, suddenly, I just stopped. I couldn't speak anymore. It felt too exhausting, too overwhelming, and too painful, and more than anything it was much much too difficult. That night I stayed in my mom's room - I wouldn't eat or drink, and she came and checked on me often. I never once said a word. Just cried off and on. Even when my sister came in and basically yelled at me to say something, that I was freaking mom out, I said nothing. It only deepened the pain I felt.\n\nAt some point I had decided to starve/dehydrate myself. My mom brought me water, and when she left the room, I poured it down the bathroom sink and crawled back into bed. I physically willed for my body to just shut down. I didn't want to exist anymore.\n\nI don't remember exactly how long I stayed like that, but it must have been 2-3 days. I was still communicating over text, and eventually my mom and some of my friends convinced me to let them come over. We sat and played games and I still couldn't speak. I just kept typing things on my phone to communicate.\n\nEventually they got me to laugh. It took several laughs later before my voice choked out a few words finally. It took some time but my talking slowly came back.\n\nTo this day, I still don't understand what made me go mute. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this - if it's possible to become so depressed that you cannot physically talk? That you just lay in bed and try to waste away? I've read about selective mutism and other things like that but couldn't find anything about temporary mutism during a depressive crisis.",

    "text": "I'm stressed as hell because of college again. Because I was, for some fucking reason, put in two math classes. I have never been good at math, and I failed the math portion of a new test I had to take because of covid, to get into college. Because of this, I have to take a remedial math course. This is fine. I'm kinda failing that class too, but not as bad, so I can probably pull that one back to passing. The only class I'm not failing is English, because I'm a fucking dumbass, and don't pay attention half the fucking time. So now I guess I'm paying the price. But I want to know, who the hell in the higher-ups in this school, thought \"Hey! You know what would be a great idea! Let's put the kids who failed the math test to get into college, in fucking Stats along with the other course! So they have two math courses at the same fucking time to worry about!\" \n\nI've already damn near failed two of my courses last semester, because somebody thought it was a good fucking idea to put me, a clueless freshman, in a government class ment for softmores and juniors. So that damn near fucked me over right out the gate. And I also had to go through all nine rings of Hell that is getting the government to do their job and actually help people for once. So, honestly, when I go to my stats professor tomorrow and ask her for advice, if I hear her say something like \"You don't normally get two math courses in one semester\" I wouldn't be surprised. Though, I might have a fucking mental break down. Because part of me feels like my college experience is just going to be Hell for four years. \n\nAnd, yes, I'm sure there are going to be people who will think \"Well, if you paid attention, you wouldn't be in this situation.\" Because it's true. But hindsight is a bitch, and doesn't help at all. And, something else that doesn't help, is the fact that I have been lying to my family this entire times, saying \"I'm doing fine\" when I'm not. Because I feel like I'm not allowed to fail. I'm getting basically everything paid for, either by them or an organization. (Lighthouse For The Blind, since I'm visually impaired) And my brother already dropped out of Embry Riddle, so now everyone in my family is putting even more pressure on me to succeed. They have even told me straight out, that they hope I don't fail a d drop out like my brother did. So that isn't helping. And it's also a major reason I've been lying to them. So, yeah. That's my stress-fruled rant because I'm too stressed to sleep. I hope to whatever God is there that I can preform some sort of miracle and pass this year. Mabye after I get through the hell that is two math classes in one fucking semester, I'll be able to take the classes I actually came to college for. Then mabye, I'll actually want to pay attention and start doing better. \n\nFuck me.",

I have mentioned to only one have my best friends and she is helps me make decisions about stupid things or downright illegal things. not like make up or fashion things. like, \"should i spray paint that wall over there?\" or \"i wanna beat the shit out of that kid\" (fully knowing i can't fight and they would 100% snap me in half like a twig). her response usually being \"ali. no, don't do that\" or \"ali.. no.\". i'm not trying to sound cool or anything or look cool but i have a strange urge to commit crimes sometimes (i know that yelling in public is not a crime). i even acted on one of these urges one time. it was nothing serious, just me being stupid. almost got caught but someone took blame for me.\n\ni have been trying to look for an escape from reality and games and music and other things, just don't work anymore. i was looking into the easiest \"drug\" i could get my hands on and that it one is lean. not really an escape but something to distract me from my girlfriend going into war. it looked tempting but i knew i had to ask my bestie and sadly she said no. i no longer have an escape and the world is getting darker and im trying to act like nothing it happening. my girlfriend was my only escape from a cruel and dark world. i can't get my hands on alcohol, drugs, or a loaded gun so i can't do anything besides just side on the sidelines of the world and watch. i think the only way i can escape is to do stupid shit until i get shot or i just end myself by accident. i want to be a person that knows that the world is ending but still finds the beauty in many things. their is only one thing that is beautiful to me as of recently. its nature. trees, bugs (love hate relationship them 'em), animals, rocks, mountains, and bodies of water. anything that nature made i find strangely beautiful. i find the philosophy of nature interesting. my dad knew that the world was slowly burning so he lived it to the fullest instead of being caught by school work or a job when he was younger.\n\nsincerely..

When I say struggling, I mean I am depressed, anxious, thinking too far ahead, feel physically sick, substance abuse, the usual PTSD presentation. This has nothing to do with me engaging in any type of self harm. \n\nWe do not have children; in fact, a lot of this was brought on by severe endometriosis, failed attempts to treat it, and ultimately an oopherectomy 14 months ago that did not cure her. We are in our early 30s. \n\nNo children. No real responsibilities. But I cannot function. I'm so cognitively foggy, my head hurts all the time, I can hardly sleep, I cry at the drop of a hat.

Honestly I feel like a complete mess, like how am I going to even make it to 40, what will I actually be doing?\n\nI suddenly felt like drinking hard liquor again and this sadness and anger just came over me. I don\u2019t know. I know suicide isn\u2019t the answer and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that to my family but honestly\u2026 would stop all this. \n\nI\u2019ll stop ranting now I guess. Just feeling pretty shit overall and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fall back into that dark pit I was in years ago. Thanks for reading all this.",

    "text": "To anyone who reads this, I appreciate you. Knowing that there are many others that feel similarly as I, I am so sorry. I wouldn't wish the type of existential dread I have been feeling these past few months on even my worst enemy. I don't know where else to turn. I read other's posts about having suicidal ideations, and while I have related in past times in my life, I had hope they wouldn't return.\n\nIt's so strange, to know that I will have ups and downs. Drastic ones. (bipolar disorder runs in the family), and any time I display or voice my depression, I feel like I am victimizing myself to those around me and feel like such a burden. I KNOW that it shouldn't feel that way. I know what kind of support I should be receiving, and I'm just not. From there, it is a steep down ward spiral. Am I not important enough to reach out to, to have a serious talk to, to do anything out of  one of my loved ones way to take a real moment and help me. I struggle so much, mostly with just needing to feel cared for. I have two sisters, who are my entire world. If it weren't for them, I promise you I wouldn't be here any more, easy. And it's shocking to even think about, and type that into real words. Last year around this time, I was really bad off. I never recovered fully, although I do go to therapy semi-regularly, from these awful plummets down into the dark mental state in which I have been stuck. Sometimes I think, \"I know things will maybe get better, eventually, but its not even worth whats good in the end to live for anymore\". I am 21 and have CPTSD for physiological trauma and abuse growing up in my childhood-teen home. I was always \"victimizing' myself when I said I wasn't okay as a child. In my diary when I was maybe 7 or 8, I wrote that I wanted to kill myself. My mom went through my journal, and covered that page up with stickers and wrote \"Don't worry, be happy\" She never once mentioned to me anymore about it. I was ashamed, as if I needed to hide it and so I began to take it out on myself. I'd ride my bike as fast as I could through low hanging branches, just to feel pain. Always chancing that maybe, I'd hit my head hard enough and the gashes would kill me somehow. Then I'd come home ,and say I didn't see the branches there. It was an accident. Eventually, I told my parents that I was intentionally hurting myself. To feel pain. It was a way for me to cope with the anger. By taking it out on myself. Every night I cry for my younger self. I had such big dreams and was so optimistic about growing up and moving out and living my life. Unfortunately though, if you are familiar with/ or suffer from CPTSD from childhood trauma, my god It never leaves you. The guilt my parents put in my head for moving out so young, leaving them. Some nights I wake up with auditory hallucinations of my mother calling me a selfish spoiled bitch and I can hear it clear as day as if she's standing right over me, yelling. Another thing that has been wearing on my body, my health, and my mental, is my reoccurring sleep paralysis. Also a common occurrence for people with all types of PTSD, along with night terrors. It is making sleeping an absolute nightmare.\n\nMy sisters, as I mentioned, are my absolute rocks. We vent and cry and go mental all of the time together. But it's really hard for us to help eachother, because of how different our trauma coping is.\n\nWhat weighs on me the most, is that I genuinely feel like such a burden. For awhile I will have it manageable, and I am really, really good at being efficient at work, putting a smile on and trying my best to make sure I look like I am doing alright. And sometimes, I feel alright. However, theres never a day, and hasn't been a day of my adult life that I haven't felt like I'm walking on eggshells, that I'm a fuck up and I need to do something more with my life, that what I'm doing isn't enough. That I'm a failure. That I can't push through any longer. Mostly, I am writing on here because I am scared.\n\nI live alone, and my lease is up in June. I need to find a roommate or someone I trust to live with. But with that comes all sorts of worries, that they don't need my breakdowns or burdens in their lives. Living alone has been a living hell, I come home After work and feel the darkest worst presence. Just being alone with myself. I start to think. I start to spiral. I can hear auditory hallucinations in my head of just the worst things   people have ever said to me.\n\nI would like to add that, since my high school days, my parents have actually succumb to the realizations of their faults raising us. They have gotten help, and they are more supportive. Which almost makes it harder. They're both very anxious beings, I can hardly go to my moms without having a real panic attack. Being around them makes me sad. I don't feel close enough to tell them any of my problems, however  they do relate to me more, as they have both been in this position themselves before in life, and it doesn't seem to have gotten much better for either\n\nEverything makes me sad, and somehow I find a way to full circle it all back to me. I just with that I could stop living without hurting those who have been loved ones my whole life. I think about it regularly. And I haven't been this bad off with self harm and care for myself since I was a helpless, lost teenager looking for any way out.\n\nI don't find it worth it to wait any longer for the good stuff that could come. Is it selfish of me to think that the closest people In my life don't put the same effort into my problems, as I do theres? I suffer from carrying many hard ships of those I love, and I know with all my heart I would do anything, offer anything, make time for them to find help. ensure that if they lived alone thinking about the easiest way to end it, I would be there and be with them until they were in a place of being taken care of and felt supported. I feel alone, unsupported, and not taken seriously. Everyone has struggles, and I have brushed mine off until tonight. Laying in the bath just thinking of the easiest ways my life could end. Then I have so much anger within myself for not being able to hold it together, I blame myself constantly.\n\nWhat should I do? I truly am not sure what the protocol is for suicidal thoughts and ideations. You reach out to loved ones, right? And that normally goes somewhere, but it hasn't. Just as it hasn't for years.",

    "text": "Hi, I am a 16-year-old female. I know that I'm very young and don't fully understand the world yet and/or may seem selfish for even typing all of this out. But, I really, really hate my life. I know other people out there in the world may have it the worst, but right now, this is just about me. This is about my life and if you're really reading all of this, please tell me your thoughts and what I can do to make my life better.\n\nFirst I would like to point out that I hate the way I'm living. I live in a trailer park, so the trailer I live in is pretty small. I am small myself, so sometimes I don't mind the amount of space in the trailer, but the way that my family and I live in this trailer is (in my opinion) abnormal. The house is always a mess, there are boxes everywhere (especially in my room) mostly because we're always sending stuff to my mom's family who lives in another country. I moved here to America 8 years ago, and 8 years before that I lived in a large 2-story house.  Now that I'm 16, I realize how small this trailer is. Because it's almost always a mess, there's barely room to move around. My dad (a huge procrastinator) promises that he will clean up, and there are rare times when he will clean a small portion of the house. But then that portion will go back to its original messy state. My mom (God bless her poor soul) always complains about how messy the house is and is the one who is always cleaning up the house.\n\nThe trailer I live in literally feels like a storage space. It doesn't even feel like a home, and I hate it. I want to be angry at my dad, mostly because he's the one who continuously delays finding an actual house for us to move into and live in but I know that he has a lot on his hands. He's always the one who pays the taxes, electric bills, water bills, wi-fi, access to my phone, etc.  I know he works hard, but I feel as if he works only for his benefit. Sometimes I wonder if he ever truly even thinks about his family and/or his family's health. My mom doesn't really know how to take care of bills or taxes so we all rely on my dad.\n\nI don't blame anything on my mom because she works really hard cleaning up after me, my dad, and my sister. I grew up with the mentality of not having to worry about doing chores, and now that I'm 16, doing a simple task like cleaning the kitty litter feels stressful and exhausting enough for me. I feel terrible because my mom is the only one who does all the chores and I want to help so bad but I can barely get myself to take a shower every other day. I don't know if I have depression, I don't have a therapist (as I mentioned before, my dad is a huge procrastinator) so I have no clue what is truly wrong with me. Maybe all it is is that I'm just a lazy-ass living off of my parents. I want to help, but I get this disliking or unpleasant feeling whenever I try to get up and go do a single chore. My sister also has the same problem. I feel so guilty and I just want to GET UP without a single thought telling me to \"do it later\" or \"just lay down, somebody else will take care of it\".\n\nLiving in this house and life makes me feel so dirty. I just feel horrible every day and it's been affecting me so much to the point that I can barely go to school anymore. I have always figured I had some kind of depression ever since I was 12. Usually, whenever I felt really upset or sad, I ignored it and pushed it away, and would go to school pretending like it wasn't even there. Eventually, the feeling would go away on its own throughout the day. But ever since I turned 15, I haven't been able to pretend like everything was okay. I don't know if it's because of my hormones or because I'm growing older or maybe that I'm more aware that there is something wrong with me, but it's been so hard to go to school and tell myself that I'm gonna have a good day. I've had multiple mental breakdowns at school which I never had until my sophomore year. I usually am able to keep my mental breakdowns at home, but it's been so much harder, and I really don't know what the reason is.\n\nIt's honestly ironic because I remember when I was 12 or 13 I kept telling myself that I was okay and I especially wouldn't do anything harmful to myself because I'm \"not crazy.\" And yet there I was at the age of 15 with the sharp end of my lip gloss because I was too scared to use an actual knife.\n\nI despise my life. I especially despise the way that I think. I don't know what it is, maybe it's the depression or the way I grew up, but I have a dislike when it comes to hanging out with other people. Maybe that makes me an introvert, but I also like to think of myself as an extrovert because I've been told that I can be very outgoing and I do like to go to parties or socialize sometimes. But when people ask me to hang out, I get this feeling of unease. I don't know if it's a feeling of anxiety or dislike but it stops me from hanging out with friends or other people. There are times when I feel bored and want to hang out with someone so I'll call them up and ask to hang out. Those are times when I don't feel unpleasant or... annoyed. It can even be when someone asks me to go online and play a video game with them. That's when the unpleasant feeling comes. If I had to describe the feeling, it can sometimes be a feeling of annoyance or irritation, probably even fear. I don't know why, maybe it's because I just don't feel like hanging out on those times that my friends ask. I feel bad because it happens often. Though usually I just force myself to hang out with them, telling myself that I'll create a new memory or experience and might even have fun. Though even telling myself that doesn't make the unpleasant feeling go away. I force myself to go through with hanging out with my friends either way.\n\nAnyways, I don't know what to do with my life anymore.\n\nI tell myself that if I just wait a few years longer, I'll eventually become a successful person. Which usually makes me feel better because I'm excited to become an adult and hopefully live happier than how I'm living now. I honestly hate the way that I'm living. Specifically, it has to do with the trailer I'm living in. I don't want to grow up in this dingy trailer park or in this terrible trailer. I want to live that experience of living in a big house, with a big yard, maybe even in a neighborhood filled with a lot of kids that I can go hang out with. That's the life I want to grow up in while I'm still a teenager. But I feel selfish and guilty for thinking that way. I know there are probably kids out there who don't even have the chance to live under a shelter at all. I don't know if I should just accept the way that I'm living... I don't know where to start. Knowing that I can't make myself do things without delaying it (just like my dad...) is so tough. I know I can tell myself, \"go get a job, earn some money, get your permit and then your driver's license, etc.\" but the act of actually doing it feels so mentally and physically exhausting. I wish I could just make myself move without a single thought. And I can't rely on my dad because relying on him is like waiting for a giant rock to move. I also can't rely on my mom because she has no clue how taxes work and her drivers' license is expired. It feels like I have to do things on my own. But how am I supposed to rely on myself when I can barely get out of bed just to go to school? I don't know what to do.",

I don't have anyone I can talk to about it and I'm trying to find a therapist but the ones I have access to through work are very focused on just basic coping skills which I'm so overly familiar with I struggle to gain anything from it. I have been trying to cope in positive ways and fight negative impulses but being around acquaintances just makes me feel worse and trying to meet new people has the same affect. I have taken up running again and I went on walks or at least outside most days before. I go to work and I try to address my thoughts and feelings as they are, feel them, and let them pass but everything just gets more and more terrible if I let myself think. Even distractions have mostly stopped working I find myself losing where I am in books or shows or games and stuck in negative thought cycles feeling completely unlovable. My whole life feels like it's caving in around me and I just don't know what to do. I don't want to die I just am so unbelievably tired of it all being so hard. I drank hydrogen peroxide last night and pretty immediately got sick and then cut and I did it again this morning and tonight. This is months in the making I don't know what to do anymore about anything it just all hurts so much all the time. I can't even sleep without it I don't think because everything is too loud and listening to the thought circles just make me suicidal and I can't refocus. I don't know what to do. I just want help",

I feel like a piece of crap because of how envious I can get. I take all honors classes although there is one ap class that I decided not to take. Some of my friends are in that class and I hate when they bring it up because I feel so jealous they took it. I know its my fault that I didn't take it but I can't but feel so jealous. I want to get into a really good college and for some reason I have it engraved in my brain that not taking that ap class as a freshman will bring me down. Along with that, if I hear any accomplishments my friends make I get jealous. I want to feel happy for them but in the back of my mind I'm incredibly jealous of them. This is a terrible mindset and sometimes I want to punch myself for it. I know that jealousy is normal but I take it to the extream. I spend alot of time thinking about how low I am on the success scale compared to the people around me. My big issue is that I want to be better than everyone all the time. It sounds so terrible when I type it out, but it's the truth. It makes me want to scream. I have adhd and have struggled alot with obsessions with my mistakes and downfalls in the past. If anyone has any tips to help me get over this horrible side of me, it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso I don't know exactly if this is a mental health thing but it has been heavily affecting my mindset.

She pays for him to fly out and everything he wants when he comes to visit. When they are together Conner takes her phone and reads through all her messages, she thinks this is normal, he threatens her with killing himself if she doesn't do what he wants, and when they're apart he constantly makes threats to kill or harm himself if Riley doesn't send him money for cigarettes/weed. In the 5th year of the relationship he suddenly sprung on her that he is poly, it wasn't a conversation about who he is and what he feels and needs, it was i'm gonna date this person that you don't know and didn't know i was talking to, and you're gonna be fine with it. Riley didn't express much dismay to him at first but she was heartbroken &amp; wished they could've at least talked about it before he found someone, when she finally brought that up he got mad at her and said she just cries about everything he does. As soon as Connor got with his new partner he had a million issues with my friend, and told her they couldn't be together anymore because she was bad for his new relationship, whilst she was being fully supportive and even trying to get to know his new partner (well call them Sam) and be friends with Sam. So suddenly they're broken up, Connor tells her he never actually loved her and he says no contact is allowed, as per Sam's orders apparently, this makes Riley think that Sam is horrible and controlling over Connor when in reality it just seemed like he was looking for an excuse to get rid of Riley. Jump forward a few months, she's finally starting to heal and realize the way he treated her wasn't ok, &amp; he unblocks her. Reaches out to her and tells her things are horrible with Sam, he never loved Sam and always loved her &amp; if she'll just pay for his plane ticket he'll come live with her forever, this visit lasted 2 weeks because he had to go home to Sam ?? Now he's back home and blocked her again, Sam texted Riley to tell her Connor is laying hands on them. While i was trying to express how much that worries me for her she went off on a long spiel about how Connor has never hit her and never would (i've heard that sentence and seen it go bad many times before) I say, he's showing who he is, and who he'll become when you have hard times. She says they don't have hard times. This is the first time i said exactly what i was thinking... You're straight up lying to yourself now.\nIm trying so hard to remain gentle with Riley, she hasn't had a lot of exposure to how people really are as she has an overbearing mother who still treats her like she's 12 years old at 25. She's just So na\u00efve and i don't know how to help her other than continuing to be there for her no matter what choice she makes... but everytime i talk to her lately it's me biting my tongue so i don't hurt her or start an argument about Connors character, because she will always argue that he's great and the only reason they have problems is because they're not living together. At the end of the day i just try to express to her that all i care about is her well-being.",

Does anyone have any idea of if this is ocd and how I can stop it. Thanks.",

    "text": "I am currently in college and have been trying to get into see someone since the fall of last year, My insurance and financial situation makes it difficult but when I went in to talk to my doctor last she told me it seemed like executive functioning issues and that I should try to get into seeing a neuropsychologist and if that couldn't work she also said psychiatrists would be able to help me figure out what was going on. I said 5 years in the title cause the first time I tried to get help was when I was 15, it didn't really go well, My parents didn't believe anything was wrong cause I wasn't failing in school, they just equated it to me being lazy or paranoid. At 15 the doctor I went to told me that the process for figuring out if I had ADHD would be too long and I should try meditating instead, my mom brushed off everything, and anytime after that when I asked to get in to see someone or told my parents I was having a difficult time they just ignored it. Now I am trying to navigate this as an almost broke college student with what I feel like is a half-asleep mind. I am not failing my classes, Math is the only one I am actually possibly gonna fail. I go to a 2-year college near my house and am working on trying to transfer. Today I called the psychiatrist I found that could get me in within a week and ended up figuring out that it would cost $500, meaning that I can't really afford it, the option I had over 2 months ago was a neuropsychology appointment in June, at the time and even now I could tell that mentally it was not going to be good for me to wait that long, I feel like over time I have just gotten progressively more and more depressed and upset with myself. So I told my parents, they haven't really been supportive of me going to see a specialist because they just assumed I am med seeking or that it would be a waste of time. They aren't supportive of the idea of me going on meds, they think it'll rot my brain or any of the other stuff they've said. My parents keep getting mad at me cause apparently, all my ideas aren't as good as me waiting till June or not going at all. When I went to talk to my dad about the cost not really going to ask him to foot the bill he just puffed his chest and basically said that he wouldn't be paying for it since it won't help me, the reviews all say multiple visits (half-true cause they also do therapy but I know Psychiatrists need to do checkups), I am not a child so he shouldn't have to call or figure this out for me (never asked him to), and that I should've called and asked for the same appointment the specialists office told me not to take because of how far away it would've been with me being in school. I feel like every time I talk to them about this it always ends up making me feel even worse, it's not just the fact that having to listen to advice from two people who didn't help me the first time and have continued to insinuate that there is nothing wrong with me and I am just overdramatic, it's the fact that every time they say anything about what I am trying to do they don't even take the time to listen to me or to care about whats going on. I know they wouldn't help me if I was a minor, cause they didn't help me when I was, they just ignored what was going on with me, My mom has slyly admitted to noticing signs that I haven't been doing okay then and now, but just says I am being rude when I call her out on it. I am just feeling defeated and shitty, I don't even know what the point of all of this is, I'm just not doing okay and I feel like they don't care enough to think about what they're saying to me, they don't know what is going on inside my head like they do, no matter how many questions they ask they always forget and then make jokes about it like it's supposed to make me laugh, like laughing at something that makes me feel like my brain and I am slowly dying is funny. I keep thinking about how different of place I would be in if I at 15 or even 16 got to see someone who could help me, and it just makes me resent them more. I'm just upset, I feel defeated and unsupported, and I don't know what to do anymore. I wouldn't say I am feeling suicidal, I know that if I keep trying things will get better with time, I just feel empty and resentful, that's all.",

Is this like a panic attack or something? \n\nI\u2019ve not been diagnosed with anxiety or anything, but it happens like 2 times a year, which isn\u2019t a lot, but it happens enough for me to think something of it. \n\nMost recently, I\u2019ve been sick with a sinus infection and I woke up at like 6 and my mind was going NUTS about only being stuck in the world of the book I was reading the night before. My brain hyper fixated on my dreams, and then it was like impossible to not frame things in that world, so my brain hyper fixated on bashing myself for not being able to separate fiction from real life. This isn\u2019t a problem I normally struggle with, but because I had a dream about it and this weird thing was happening, my brain took it and ran with it. \n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar or knows anything about it please let me know.

But, when I am fragile and feel depressed (like now) a ton of memories come flooding back in, even when I can recognize that they are unchangeable and far in the past. Many of them have to do with experiences I had in high school, and even though I want nothing more than to be at peace with them, they will return at random times and make me feel super angry at both ex-friends or adults who I feel wronged me. Sometimes, I will even get angry about very minute one-time interactions, like times when people were rude to me or disrespected me.\n\nDo y'all have any tips for how to deal with these memories coming back? It disrupts my daily life and gets me pissed at myself for not being able to move on. Sometimes they anger me so much I can't distract myself and feel like crying. I am in therapy, but have crap mental health care through insurance so only receive a 45 minute appointment every month (or more), in which I have not been able to discuss these thoughts and instead just recap how I am doing. I really want to talk to someone who will help me work through those emotions, but in the meantime would really appreciate any advice on how to deal with intrusive, negative memories. :)",

Even tho i try people still say I don't change face expression too much. My therapist even pointed out that she found it odd how when I told her about my trauma that I basically had a poker face the whole time.\n\nI think I might have a serious problem with empathy too.  It's not that I cant empathize at all. I can but usually only when I can directly relate to the person. I do feel bad for not caring as much as I'm expected to.

    "text": " There is really no way for anyone to understand, for everyone that could understand are already dead. Truly, disgusting filth should not be left alive. I truly hate disgusting filth. What I mean by filth is black people, white people, asian people, indian people, whatever type of race and ethnicity. They are all filth and I wish every single one of them would die horribly and painfully. I also hate gays, lesbians, transgenders, sjw retard delusional fucks, they also need to be killed much much more horribly than whoever was just born into their race/ethnicity. I hate myself, for thinkikng such horrible thoughts and the inability to change them no matter what. No matter how nice someone is to me I will also want them to die. I enjoy watching things suffer. It tickles my senses like nothing else. I deserve to be killed the most. The filthiest of the filth, the worst of the worst. I am worse than satan and I need to be killed. If this is read on some printed paper, I am probably dead. I love my family. I wish they would die every now and then. I ponder many many ways to kill everyone around me. I imagine how it would feel to rape everyone. I would rape them infintly over and kill them infitnly over and feel good about it. I am a danger to society, a ticking time bomb. There is no hope for me. I was born into a christian family but feel more as if I am an atheist. I belive in god and I also don\u2019t and wish he was dead. I wish I was god so I could rape veryone infinlty over and do whatever the fuck I want. I never searched for help in the pretense that it would never help me. I know it can\u2019t, probably. What\u2019s some retard gonna do by talking to me. All that makes we want to do is kill and rape them. I fantasise about breaking into homes, killing everyone inside and raping them over and over. I don\u2019t do anything at home and am unemployed. I want to pursue my dreams and if I am unable to do so I will kill myself. I am incredibly unsociable, socially indept, talking is basically impossible and I am self aware enough to understand that I am one of those weird kids that I hate so much. I am a narcissist and I hate how I look and everything about me. My principle in life is to not get involved with anything after all there is less to lose then. Filth scum like should just be killed. I believe governments should just kill all the horrible people and leave a world where everyone is happy. I want to be happy in a good way. I love my family. Too nice to me, especially my mother, she is nothing less than an literal angel from the heavens. I, or no one deserves her. She should have been happy with someone else. I should have been aborted. Truly. There is no happiness to be found anywhere. I have given up hope and am waiting for something spectacular to happen to drastically change my life for the better or for worse. I just need something to change, otherwise I can\u2019t be happy. I don\u2019t believe in mental illness, I think it is all a sham, just for fucksies, unnecessarily over the top lies. I don\u2019t have depression. There is nothing for me to be sad about, I am living the perfect, spoiled, life that everyone could desire. I am loved by few people. No one at school knows me. I have nothing to be sad about. There is nothing to be angry about. I live perfectly, in a perfect world, perfectly safe from everything. There are people in ukraine as we speak getting blown up and here I am in the united states doing absolutely nothing and complaining. Therefore I should be killed. I hate america so much. The rich should be systematically executed and slaughtered like pigs and their money distributed among everyone. I hate americas capitalism that creates worlds where the poor suffer and the rich have too much money that they don\u2019t know what to do with it. I want to find love. However, knowing how I am know, it is not possible unless by god\u2019s grace he sends down an uncorruptable angel to soak up everything for me. I am unable to change. There is nothing that could change me. Just kill me. There is no embarrasment. I long for nothing. I long for everything.  The dark scares me, death is coming and I am terrified. I am just another emo edgy teenager that really should be out of his phase right now. Oh how I wish that were true. But it is true definitely. It can\u2019t not be true. Horrible people like myself should be killed. If I was to compare myself by my own twisted, misguided metric, I would place myself below the worst serial killers and rapists. The horrible shit that I am. I am spoiled. Spoiled to the core. If everything doesn\u2019t happen the exact way I want it to I will kill myself. That is why I am writing this now. I am an ungrateful bastard that should just be killed. The solution to everything is death. Even after death what would happen? I would like to persuade myself that even hell is better than this, but I am truly not convijnced by myself. Hell is pain and pain and infinite unending torture. There is nothing, absolutely nothing that I am looking forward to about hell. If I could sacrifice myself for the prosperity of everyone, I would absolutely do so. That is a lie. I would not do so. I would however do so because it will end me. And my value is less than that of anyone. There is nothing to be sad about. There is nothing to be worried about. The world will move and I will move with it. Like a school of fish. I love art. I hate how I am unable to produce satisfactory pieces. I am a nervous wreck, but also I am not. I am acting but also I am not. I do not think I am acting but I am acting but I\u2019m not acting? I\u2019ve been acting my entire life. I have not, that was a lie. I was never acting. Maybe for a few years, but that evetnaully became the true me. The true me is the act. Is it. The true me is a goofball. I am a goofball. That is my persona. I am an inconsiderate sociopath? I am not a sociopath. I have clear feelings and emotions. I feel sad and feel angry whenever slight inconveiencences happen. I feel bad for people and love people truly. I hate people truly as well. There is something wrong with me, for I do not feel like a normal person. But there is also nothing wrong with me. There is nothing wrong with me and I am a completely normal person that is just venting about nothing. There is nothing to be sad about. I have everything. I hav infinite knowledge at the touch of a finger tip. I could be doing anything. I could be laughing, enjoying myself. I could be doing everything. Therefore I should die. There is nothing to be sad about. But I am sad. About what? I do not understand what it is. I just need to die. I hope my death will be painless, or so I hope. I hope. The three best possible ways would be jumping off a tall building into a hard surface, preferably not water, because I would just painfully drown. Hanging myself, I have heard that without oxygen, people\u2019s brains shut off, which would limit the pain to a few minutes or so. And guns. As much as I hate guns and hate edverythhing about how people get kille devery day from it. I also believe it is a great way to die. Painlessly, hopefully. I hate my past. An immigrant from a very veyr young age, there is very little to no way to connect basically everyone in my family. I am foreign to them. And they look down on me for that. Those sick fucks decided to put me here. I want to kill them all, horribly, and rape them. There is nothing to be angry about. I look at war pictures and it looks horrible. How could they have kept their mental fortitude. What is it that I have to feel sad about. I am not dealing with anything. There is no stress. There is no pain. There is not imminent threat of bombshells dropping on me from the trenches. I am completely perfectly living. I am safe and there is nothing to be sad over. I hate people. I am petty. I believe in petty things so much. Therefore I should die. I should be killed. There is nothing. Absolutely nothing to be sad about. I am happy, I am sad, I am excited, I am angry, I am a normal person. I am completely normal. There is nothing to be sad about. Nothing to kill oneself over. I just need to die. If you don\u2019t agree with me I hate you and want to kill and rape you. If you agree with me, I would tell you that you don\u2019t understand what I am truly feeling and want to kill and rape you. There is no misundestanding. I am misunderstanding myself. But I\u2019m also not. I want to love others, but I also hate them more than anything. I feel compassion and empathy for everything and everyone. I am perfectly normal person. I feel compassion and empathy for the pigs, the dogs, the shit on the side of the road. The rock I kickedd into the sewer. The item I threw away out after a long time of unuse, I feel bad for it. It feels like me. But I also don\u2019t care about it. I will crush ants and bugs and feel bad about it 3 seconds later. I would kill someone and probably feel bad about it too. I have committed nothing. There is nothing I have done. Everything is in my head and I have nothing wrong with me. Please take these words truly, there is no sarcasm. I truly believe that there is nothing wrong with me. Therefore I need to die. A mistake. I was not a mistake. There is nothing wrong with my family. There is nothing wrong with my life. Everything is just wrong with me. I refuse to believe there is something wrong with me. Therefore everything is fine and I want to die. I have not killed anyone. I am horny a lot of times. I am just an edgy teenager who is going through a phase. Everyone has done it and overcome. There is nothing wrong with me. I am the majority. I am exactly the same as everyone else. People can choose what they want. They should be happy. Gays and lesbians, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care what race you are. All that matters is you. I truly wish the happiness of everyone. Everyone should be happy. Without me. I am the anchor, preventing the ship from moving. The ball chained around one\u2019s ankles. The world could be happy. It will be happier with me gone. I swear on everything. Nothing would change with on measly death. One measly disspearance. A temporary sadness upon a loss in the family that they had seen coming but did nothing about. A temporary sense of grief, espcially among my immediate family members. Besides them, no one will glance an eye or even know who I was. Let alone everyone else. No one will know who I was or what I was. I will be forgotten, and that will bring true happiness. People should truly be happy. I hate guns for the death they bring. I hate governments for their corrupt behaviours and disregard for people. I hate black people because most of them are responsible for most of the crimes. I hate white people for creating a society that discriminates the blacks and for being the cause of the aforementioned crimes. I hate white people for being rich and wealthy, and annoying. I truly wish they were happy. The world could have been a happy place. My death will make it happier. I was unable to live in a world where happiness was easy. Therefore I should die. Others were angry, sad, and unhappy, therefore I should die. I should be dead because others wanted to die as well. I want to be a saviour. A god. A benevolent force against evil that would save everyone. I want to be a hero that could solve everyone\u2019s problems. But I can\u2019t. Therefore I will die. I want to save people and be a doctor. But I can\u2019t, and its too hard. Its inconvneitn and I don\u2019t care. Therefore I should die. I couldn\u2019t do something I want, therefore I should die. I couldn\u2019t make those around me happy and therefore I should die. My purpose is unclear, but my desires aren\u2019t. I wish for happiness. But I can\u2019t do that, so I must die. Why one may ask. Why I may ask. There is no reason. I just need to die. Otherwise sadness will ensue and the world will crumble. I cause sadness, the exact opposite of everything I wanted to be. I am a waste of air, resources, time, love, effort, of everyone around me. I will die one day providing nothing to anyone, only taking from everything. Horrible people like me should be killed. I do not socialise, I do not talk. I do not give and I try my dearest best not to receive either. But I receive, therefore I should die. I am happy, therfore I should die. I shouldn\u2019t be happy. People are getting bombed in ukraine and I am happy? I should die. Honestly, the world doesn\u2019t need horrible people. Even now as I type this, what an ego. What a fucking ego. Self aware my ass. There is nothing I am aware about. Just a delusional fucktard that blames everything on something and nothing on nothing and whatever. My ego is massive. Typing this I had the slight thought that someone might think I was a virtuous person. I wish you would not think that. I am a horribl eperson. I wish the deaths of everyone and wish the happiness of everyone and wish the daeth of myself which would only bring sadness. However also bringing happiness. What massive ego. Therefore I should die. The desire to be remembered like this is also present in my psyche, hence why I am writing this, therefore I should die. There should be no remnants of me and I should sell all my possessions and at least give to those in need before I die. I think I am virtuous. I am not. I am not virtuous. I am not horrible. I am not a terrible person, nor am I a waste of air. I am definitely a horrible person. A waste of space and resources. I don\u2019t deserve anything and therefore I should be killed. I don\u2019t deserve the wasted effort of satan and his pitchforks as I burn in hell. I should just be killed. I don\u2019t deserve gods grace, I should just be killed. I don\u2019t deserve anything. There shouldn\u2019t be a me. I shouldn\u2019t be alive, nor should I be dead. I should be nothing, oblivion, but even that. I don\u2019t deserve such lavish, amazing rewards such as oblivion. Aimless, I seek death. It\u2019s all too good for someone so horrible like me. I would like for people to be happy. I want to rape them and for them to worship me. I want to see them cry and grimace as I tear off their clothes with my teeth and rape them infintly over and cut into them. I want to say sorry and sorry and for them to forgive me and see that forgiveness and trust me destroyed over and over. There is no hope for me. There is always hope. It is too selfish to keep on living, to keep on dying, to keep on beliveing that someine might come. Therefore I need to die. There is ntohing wrong with me. It is selfish to believe there is not anything wrong with me. Therefore I should die. But that\u2019s too good for me. I don\u2019t wish to die. I wish to live. But that is too good for me. I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help. Don\u2019t help me. There is no hope for the horrible. That means me. I like my dogs, my cats, they love me. No, they love my pets. They love the food I give them at no cost. I hate them. They piss and shit everyone and they need to be killed and cooked and eaten. What have I been doing my entire life. What was I for. Just another edgy teenager, waiting for this phase to pass by. There is nothing. Absolutely nothing for me to be sad about. Therefore I should die. But I also shouldn\u2019t. I need some sense put into me. But that won\u2019t help. Trying to help would make it worse. I hate helpers. When you try to help me I want to kill and rape you. I hate you. I hate people that hate me. I hate people that love me. I hate people that help me. I hate that you don\u2019t care about me. Care about me. But I will hate you for it. Therefore I need to die. I want to be loved, I want to love, I want to be helped, I want to help, I want to be hero, I want god, I want him to bless me. I don\u2019t want to hate. But I hate. I hate hero that pities me, the god that blesses me. There is nothing wrong with me, so why pity me, why bless me. There is no need. Stop doing it before I hate you more. I want love, but I hate that love. Why love me, there is no emptiness here. There is no place that love could fill. But I want it. I am not devoid of love. I love my family. They love me. Of course they do. Help won\u2019t help me, it makes it worse. Love won\u2019t help me, it makes it worse. Care won\u2019t help me, it makes it worse. Doing nothing won\u2019t help me, it makes it worse. Hating me won\u2019t help me it makes it worse. Everything makes it worse. Making it worse makes it worse. But what is getting worse. Nothing is getting worse. There is nothing to get worse after all. There is nothing wrong with me. I live perfectly fine. Perfectly happily. I am genuinely comfortable, I am genuine. These feelings of love are genuine. I don\u2019t suffer. I truly truly don\u2019t suffer. Therefore I should die. My thoughts are deep, no, theya re the most shallow, ever. They are not shallow, they are level, rather level, they are higher than the clouds. But that\u2019s too selfish of me, after all it\u2019s not true. Not of it is true. Therefore I should die. Everything about me contradicts everything about me. That\u2019s too much. That\u2019s the ego speaking. That truly is the ego speaking. Nothing about me contradicts anything. My life is clear. My mind is clear. There is no fog. There is nothing wrong about me. There is no suffering. I am a compeltely normal person. But that\u2019s too much to ask for. I am nothing? That\u2019s also too much to ask for. What am I? That\u2019s also too much to ask for. Everything is my ego. Nothing contradicts. Everything contradicts? It can\u2019t be left finished, it can\u2019t be left unfinished. I will stop here. unedited",

Almost every night I stay up late because I don't want the day to end, I don't wanna have to face the challenges which may face me the next day, I just don't know how to take it all anymore, over time it really nags on you and I lose even more of my motivation to do the things I have to do. Everday I just have the constant desire to simply bang my head on the table simply for the reason of the things I do, like the procrastinating and not doing what I have to do. For example, I have an important test on friday which is pretty big and up to now I have not spent a single minute studying for it, anytime I have an assignment I hand it in late very often. Things that make it even more difficult for me are that I currently have no access to any sort of therapist I could talk to, I do not have the strength to talk to my family about this etc. and I just keep lying to myself that I will stop now but it all just continious on and on.\nOne last thing to add, I don't know if this may have something to do with it but I got some bloodtest results back today and my vitamin D levels are at 11.2 while the absolute lowest recommendation is 40.",

I go to a very expensive private university which no one has ever  heard of. I've considered going to a cheaper one but my parents wanted  me to stay here, they are paying for all my tuitions and I've always  been feeling guilty for it, after seeing all my peers paying their own  college fees or getting scholarship/aids (didn't manage to get any  scholarship cuz 90% of schools rejected me and people said i shall be  glad getting an offer). My school offers very little grants to int  students, so I took an alternative option of studying in summer terms  every year to save up around 1/5 of tuition, even though that barely  helps and don't know if my parents would allow me to, since they barely  see me anyway.\n\nSocially: Few  friends but none of which is very closed. My family is based in China,  so flight ticket is super expensive during covid and must go through 2  weeks quarantine in a hotel before I could see them even if I return.  Made me feel bad all the time by being isolated at college and never  knowing when I can see my family. My brother is only 8 now and by the  time I grad he would almost be attending middle school, and my parents  would all be over 50 by then. My inside cries all the time knowing that I  would miss the most precious time of my brother's growth and by some  day he will totally forget me.\n\nAcademically:  I studied the IB curriculum at high school and chose the easiest  classes (Math AI SL and English B HL) for points, and because I had  depression + anxiety at high school so the school made me take  certificate instead of diploma (choice of 90% of people), and I refused  so they recommended me to take the easiest courses. Consequences:  relatively high points but rejected by every other schools, struggling  at every courses in college because of poor math/English skills. I'm  practically attending college with middle school math/English ability.  Don't wanna blame anyone cuz its my own choice, but just felt angry cuz  no one has ever told me about the consequences.\n\nMentally:  diagnosed with mild depression/anxiety at Grade 11 because of PTSD from  childhood traumas of school social isolation from peers and bullying,  possess many symptoms of Aspergers. Have no dreams/ambition for the future. Only alive now for my parents. I just hate school and work so much. I feel so demotivated now and have no more energy for clubs/internship, just eating/talking to someone drains me out. I could never be happy now, I haven't felt happiness for 10 years.

My grandparents fled the soviet union in the 60s and made it to the US through some back channels because my grandfather had valuable skills the Americans were interested in. They left alot of family behind in Russia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Iron curtain my mom became obsessed with reconnecting with our family still in Russia. She became very close to a particular cousin of hers and they still talk quite regularly. Her son (technically my second cousin) is a few years younger than me and despite living in vastly different countries we bonded well the first time we went to visit them. We kept in touch and occasionally played games together online.\n\nNikkita loved to play rocket league, ARK survival evolved, and CSGO (I know, how stereotypical lol). He wanted to become a programmer when he grew up and was always there to help me with my computer issues.\n\nNikkita turned 18 last September and signed up to complete his mandatory military service soon after. He wanted to get it out of the way early so he could start training to be a programmer once he got out.\n\n He had just finished training when the invasion started. Once he was done he immediately got sent to a unit on the ukrainian border. The last anyone heard from him was a phone call with his mom a little under 2 weeks ago.\n\nWe don't have any confirmation or even speculation on his where abouts. We all have our suspicions though... I obviously see all the examples of russian war crimes and they're typically accompanied by dozens of comments calling for the indiscriminate killing of any and all russians. All I can picture is Nikkita when they say these things. \n\nObviously there are lots of evil evil people in the Russian army but at the same time there is bound to be thousands of Nikkita's too. If he's still the same kid I always knew there is no way he's committing these crimes. But I also know war brings out the worst in people and I will likely never know what he did/did not do.\n\nI'm just so conflicted. I know the Russians are the aggressors and what they're doing is wrong, but calling all russians animals who deserve to be slaughtered certainly rubs me the wrong way. \n\nEvery post I see of dead russian soldier I see my cousin in the bodies. Then I see hundreds of people celebrating their deaths and it makes me sick. I just want this stupid stupid war to stop and no more innocents on either side to die.",

    "text": "Hi, I am F18 and in my last year of high school. I have been diagnosed with *Adjustment Disorder (with Depressed Mood), ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Social Anxiety.*\n\nLast school year, I dropped most of my classes that wasn't needed for me to graduate (I am basically just doing the bare minimum to receive a diploma at this point). I was able to finish off my with a 96% in Art and a 65% in English. But through that I had to deal with many drawbacks due to my disorders; panic attacks, unable to come to class, always with the school counsellor for assistance, etc. Eventually this lead to my first suicide attempt towards the end of the school year, and me going to the hospital. But through that, I finally got the professional help needed for me. I got exempted for the last of my assignments and tests, and due to covid my finals were cancelled. Summer came and things were looking a bit brighter for me.\n\nBut nothing has changed. \n\nThe beginning of this school year, I was doing well until certain events triggered and caused a lot of mess for me mentally. This made me drop almost all of my classes, leaving only one class, English, to do. I barely could go to class and had accommodations to work in another room by myself, have a reader for my test, etc. My grade was a solid 80%, which was pretty amazing cause this was advanced placement, but soon it dropped. I finished with a bare 55% last semester even though I had one class, and I still hate myself for that to this day.\n\nThis semester, I only have two classes, but everything is worse. I can't go to class without having some sort of panic attack or breakdown, this lead me to avoid going to class at all cost. Soon enough, I had work piling up due to overusing my accommodations and avoiding. I can't sleep due to my thoughts fogging everything up late at night, I have daily suicidal ideations and thoughts (never plans), I had no motivation to do anything yet pushed myself to do the bare minimum, my hygiene was terrible and I stopped showering for weeks / brushing my teeth, I started isolating myself more due to fear of others noticing, then the thought of having to catch up on weeks worth of school work overwhelmed me. There was so much more things I had to go through, but I think I have listed enough ;-;.\n\nWith so many obstacles and worries to deal with, it pushed me past my point. I was so overwhelmed anxious, hopeless, and completely hated myself. With all of this, it then lead me to my second attempt which was a week ago, last Monday (3/07/22). I was hospitalized for a little more than a week, went to the right programs to help me while I was there, and now I am here. \n\nI went to school today and went straight to my school counsellor first thing in the morning and just broke down. I do not think I can graduate, I am 2 months behind in 2 classes that are needed for me to get my diploma, and am just overwhelmed with having to deal with trying to fix myself for school and trying to help myself mentally (trying to find more counselling, therapy, resources, going to appointments on the daily, etc.)\n\nI am not sure why I am writing this post, but I hope someone can help me out.\n\n**TLDR: All my mental disorders (I have a lot) made me fall 2 months behind in school work, and I am anxious and scared that I won't graduate high school. I don't know why I'm writing this post, but I hope you guys can suggest something and help me out.**",

    "text": "Hello! So, it's gonna be a long one and I mean, if you have any useful and kind advice or any encouraging things to say, feel free to post.\n\nI'm in a super shitty situation, things just keep getting worse, I have to make a decision but I'm just paralysed by all of it...\n\nSo I'm currently living with my mother (who seems to be narcissistic but she's never been diagnosed so I'm not gonna) and I've been living with her most of my life with very few exceptions. After a lifetime of manipulation, mental and emotional abuse, as well as being super controlling to the point where other people get annoyed with how she treats me, I'm just sick of her. She might not be AS worse as she used to but at this point is just too late and I want to get away from her, but...it's complicated.\n\nWe're living in the UK, originally from somwhere else. We moved her several years ago. She came before I did and when I came, I came with the bf I had at the time. \nIt was certainly a bad decision as things went south shortly after coming here. We had a terrible time finding any kind of work. He eventually found a job in a different town and I joined him when he had a room of his own. My relationship was extremely toxic. He never supported me when I would get depressed and completely ignored me when I was crying because \"he didn't know what to do\". \nEither way, we had plenty of fights about all sort of things but one of the biggest issues was that I just couldn't get a job. He was employed and I couuuuld not find work, at all. I did find temporary work a couple of times and tried my best. I would literally print CVs and drop them everywhere even though I had massive social anxiety caused by the SEVERE depression I was going through at the time. I was also applying to 30+ jobs daily, no exaggeration. He never believed me. He said that I just didn't want to work and that I was being just too comfortable at home. I offered to show him all the jobs I was applying for but he just never believed me.\nLong story short, on 2 occasions I found out that he was talking to other girls (romantically). The first time I forgave him but the 2nd time I was able to just say \"no, this is bullshit\". I broke up with him right away and ofc we had a fight and one of his final arguments was that \"I stayed with him for money, anyway.\" That's not true, but even if I wanted to, he was making minimum wage and I was almost never asking for anything. Besides buying some pants or shoes when I had almost nothing left to wear, I never asked for shit.\n\nAnyway, so that was really bad. It was the darkest time of my life, had the worst depression episode that lasted for more than a year and I still have deep trauma from that time. I was crying daily, couldn't remember basic things and even self-harmed a couple of times.\n\nSince then, I slowly but surely got better. I had depressive episodes but they were usually short and certainly not as intense. Things started to get progressively better in my life. There were ups and downs but my future certainly looked brighter.\n \nI am with a different man now and I love him to death. He is one if the best things that ever happened to me but he lives in a different country. We've been together for a bit more than 2.5 years and he helped me through a lot of things but he's human as well and certainly not a professional therapist.\n\nEven though things with him are going great, everything else in my life, not so much. I currently have a job that's not inherently awful but the lack of proper training in the beginning and the shitty manager made it highlydifficult. I'm afraid I'll be losing this job soon. I have ADHD and Dyspraxia and I simply need to learn things differently. I have no issues doing a good job once I know how but I certainly need more and different training than some other people. My manager is not great. She doesn't seem to get me at all, speaks to me in a superior manner and if I try asking for help, she replies with \"you should already know that\", so naturally I just never ask anything and there's really no one else I can ask for help.\nSo, I'm often fcking up things and I'm pretty certain that they'll catch up with my mistakes and decide to fire me. I try SO HARD to do what I should, but with some things, I simply don't know.\n\nAlso, as I said, I live with my mom. The house we're currently renting has been sold and we're already overdue to move out but we cannot find another house.\nWe've been renting here for 3 years and during this time we've had 2 instances during the pandemic, when we couldn't pay rent (due to me being fired because of covid and her having way less hours of work for the same reason). We've always discussed this with the agency and now the debt is almost paid.\nWe tried applying for a property and were rejected because of our current agency gave them bad references. We found a different property, explained the situation from the beginning, they said it's fine and were rejected again, because apparently there's some debt in \"our\" name according to my mom's words.\nNow, this debt is over \u00a31.2k so this is certainly not the rent and I have absolutely no debt. I have no loans and never had, never left unpaid bills or anything else so this debt is certainly not in my name, but hers. So because of HER debt we got rejected again. She seems to not know where this debt might be coming from but she's certainly had issues in the past with unpaid stuff.\n\nSo because of this, we are forced to find some company and or private landlord thag would accept us which, as you can imagine, is incredibly difficult and as I mentioned before, the house we live in has been sold and we have to move out ASAP.\n\nI plan on moving with my boyfriend, in his country. I have a bit of money saved and honestly I'm sick of living here and not finding a decent job that I don't hate amd having to live with my mother and, of course, pay bills and rent.\n\nNow this is the difficult part. \nI first have to atay here until we find a property here so that I can help my mother move. I can't stand her but I don't wanna be a massive dick and let her deal with the moving by herself, even though she's being awful to me on a daily basis. But because of her actions, this is just getting more and more complicated and I feel like she's soon gonna ask me for money, which I really don't want to give to her cuz I don't have much and I've been saving it just so I can leave. \nAnother issue that I have is the whole moving situation.\nI have some money saved, that will last for a few months but I have no clue what to do after, if I can't find some sort of a job in his city. We talked about this and he repeatedly said that he wouldn't be bothered and would never ask me to leave or guiltrip me for not having a job but I just ughhh... the trauma of what happened in the past won't leave me alone.\n\nI'm not worried that he'd suddenly start being a dick towards me but I am extremely worried that I really won't find a job for a looong time and then, what? \nI don't want to be a leech and he said it will be fine but I can't brush it off. I don't wanna be forced to come back here just so I can work and then go back there. Moving country is pretty damn difficult as it is and 6 years later, I still don't feel like England is my home and like I've ever been accepted here. I met plenty of wonderful people but overall it's been depressing and painful.\nI don't want to have to move to another country, just to be forced to come back here and work and then to have to move back and on and on.\n\nMy bf has always been reassuring and patient but I know he doesn't know what else to do or say. As I said, he's not a therapist and I really cannot afford one.\n\nI feel that \"old depression\" creeping in on me and I am so scared. Because I remember exactly how that felt back then and how almost nothing helped. The only thing that helped was me getting into a better situation and my situation, as I see it, is not getting any better.\nI try to keep myself busy, to focus on my bf, my friends, my pets, my \"goals\" and I try to go out and enjoy things but I just notice myself sloooowly going back to that place and I really don't know what to do.\nI'm exhausted mentally and physically and simply can't cope. I dissociate just so I don't sink into the depression over and over again.\n\nThe future seems dark and I feel like I will eventually lose everything again and will repeat that awful cycle. I tried and keep trying to make things better and to be a better person but it seems like all I can do is to get myself into a deeper hole and than a deeper hole and so on. I'm so tired of just surviving all the time that when I actually want to do something enjoyable, the only thing I can focus on is how much crap there is, waiting for me and how at this point, I expect a million other things to go wrong.\n\nI am aware that I should go to therapy but as I said, I just can't afford it so I really don't know what else to do.\nI'm desperate and I dread knowing that history might repeat itself. \nI just wanna live in peace ffs and not have to worry about all this crap all the time. I'm sick of applying to hundreds of jobs, just to be rejected by all of them. I've got plenty of skills and \"talent\" and what not. I try SO HARD to make my life better and to be better at work, in my relationships, in everything that I do and it seems like all I get is just the same old crap.  I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to end up in that awful depression again because I know how difficult I was for others around me as well.\n\nPeople say that loved once should be there for you when you struggle but there's only so much they can do and I am aware. I just don't know how to fix this. I don't and I'm tired. I want to live, not just survive \ud83d\ude1e\n\nIf you've made it this far, even if you don't feel like commenting, thank you!

I slept for most of the day, but when I woke up, I was feeling hyper vigilant, depersonalized, and derealized. I feel like I\u2019m in a dream. I know the things that are happening around me and to me are real, but everything is just so enhanced yet muted at the same time. I\u2019ve experienced this quite a lot, but I never thought it could be linked to mania. Right now I\u2019m just feeling drugged, like I\u2019ve been on anesthesia and am coming off of it. I feel like I\u2019m not human. I feel like an action movie star. I\u2019m not experiencing any grandiosity though. I\u2019m honestly scared that I\u2019m going to start breaking with reality. \n\nHave any of you ever experienced this before? How did you come up out of it? What did you do to help? Right now it isn\u2019t scary, per se, but it is certainly an experience. I feel like I\u2019m on LSD or something even though I\u2019ve never taken any drugs before in my life, other than the ones that are prescribed to me. \n\nI\u2019m currently on Riluzole and Caplyta if that helps you. I haven\u2019t talked to my doctor about this because it is such a new occurrence. Please comment down below if you have ever experienced this before and what your doctor/therapist told you about it.

I'm interning for my career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short I have illogical, deep-seated resentment towards small dogs. My mother kicked me out of the house multiple times but dotted on and loved our tiny dogs. She went into debt for them, spending hundreds a month easily on their care. Growing up, I wasn't allowed to touch her or go around her because her small dogs would lunge at me and bite me. She always defended them. I was a victim of physical abuse on my dad's side. Eventually, I was arrested for attempting to hurt the dogs, letting all my anger and aggression out on them. It's fucked up. I know. I'm not proud. Ultimately the dogs were fine just spooked. I don't think I had it in me to really do something. I've never had a history of hurting animals. I actually have 3 cats and a dog who I treat kindly and love very much. It's just small dogs.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance's dad was found incapacitated on the floor and admitted into the hospital for excessive drinking. We have to take in his small, untrained, unpotty trained small dog for an unknown amount of time.

I'm scared I'm really going to do something but I don't want to bring it up because I dont' want to make my fiances life any harder. I feel so horrible, but I can't just keep stuffing down these impulses I'm so nervous. No one else will take this dog because it's not potty trained and we can't give it away because it's his dads muse for recovery, potentially, and giving her up would absolutely crush him. I have no idea what to do. Are there any techniques or exercises I can do?? I'm the primary care giver of this dog right now. I take it potty, feed, water, and am house training it. But I just feel so much anger and rage towards it. There is literally 0 empathy in my heart I just go through the motions of what is right because I love my fiance",

I felt so insulted and could not believe that how they think of me. \n\nMy ex used to sleep with other women and I did not know about it during the marriage. During the first few months of marriage, he asked me about sleeping with my friends. I thought it was a joke but he was serious. He often told me that I do not have good body or asked me not to put make up on. I had to beg him to have date with me and he was so busy playing video games always. One thing makes me so sick till now is that he was an advocate of a sexual harassments prevention at work. I am pretty sure he was in that role for 5 years. After we got divorce, one of my friends called me and told me that my ex used to come to her shop and asked about some physical relationship and even getting divorced with her husband. (There is an evidence)\n\nTo be honest, I do not know how many times he actually did some type of unfaithful activities behind me. I always had some type of doubting about his action toward me but I figured several things after divorce. I thought I was going crazy but actually it was not. I always apologized to him about accusing and acting paranoid. I feel so dumb now.\n\nI have trust issue. I can't meet anyone now. It is so hard for me to start trusting and keeping the relationship. His new wife does not know anything about this and just think that I am too hostile to him. I am just sad. I want to get over this trust issue and have a healthy relationship with anyone. \n\nI started hating myself and got addicted to some shameful stuff. Meanwhile I hurt myself too. My parents used to beat me up and abused me when I was young so I just don't know how to love myself that much still. They even did not know what was going on really behind in my marriage and started blaming on me for the divorce. My ex is very calm person so nobody believes that what he can do to a person to destroy. No one will believe me if I tell them what is his true face. I feel like a broken toy everyday and can't even express what is going on with my mind. \n\nAll I want is just getting better and get out of this bad cycle.

I would have went through with it if it wasn't for my girlfriend but I never told anyone.\n\nAs usual they treated me like a lesser person.

We are also both US citizens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a background, I'm currently a PhD student in a very competitive school/program. I recently failed my first qualifying exam and only have one more shot to take it before I'm kicked out of my program. So I am under a lot of stress, mentally and emotionally.\n\nBut my boyfriend has been going through also very stressful changes and events that I feel eventually come back to me. We have been dating for almost 3 years, starting in the summer of 2019. He is a lifter and wants to be a personal trainer after he finishes graduate school (in kinesiology). In my time knowing him, he was seemingly mentally stable.\n\nBut when a bad mood happens, it is a *really bad* mood. It throws him into a self destructive state for between a day and a week. He has never hurt me while in this state but he makes off handed comments about how he has no self worth and sometimes self harm. Even when he is not in a bad mood, he will make jokes about how he is motivated by self hatred and it hurts me every time I hear them because I know they are partially true to possibly an unhealthy degree.\n\nBad moments have become more common and more intense with family troubles, COVID, and lack of progress in the gym. In addition, his lack of progress in the gym will lead him to a bad moment which forces him to take a break which I'm sure further offsets his progress which leads him to more bad moments.\n\nWhile I also appreciate that he is willing to open up to me when he has these moods, I'm scared that I am not handling it properly. I'm not a professional and his handling of these states puts me in a weird position. I did go to therapy before and have been trying to educate myself, but I'm, again, not a professional and am not sure if what had helped me work through my issues will help him.\n\nBut it's to the point where I feel he is dependent on me. I hoped that maybe he would take the techniques and thought processes I taught him to help himself but the situation has not improved.\n\nWhen we go on dates, it tends to pick up his mood. But between the pressure of studying to try to pass my qualifying exam as well as the other things expected of me, I need my own time to study and succeed in school. It also throws me into a stressful state when I try to help him with his own state and see him still struggling.\n\nI, again, have no background in dealing with mental health and while I try to show my support, I am afraid whether the language I use is helping him or further spiraling him down.\n\nEarly on, I did suggest therapy but he always brushed it off saying that there are people who need therapy more than him which I told him is kind of alienating as someone that did go to therapy for a while. Recently, I brought it up again to which I got the same reply.\n\nIn a dark moment of mine, I did express that maybe I would want to go to therapy and he said he would be willing to go with me. Maybe I might need it with what's on my plate, but would it be dirty of me to go if that meant he would go with me?\n\nI love him and what I have with him and really want to spend my future with him. While he promised me he won't do anything drastic, how he talks about himself in these moments scares me and I'm so scared of losing him because of himself if that makes sense. I want to help him but I also need him to help himself and maybe reparent himself with healthy mindsets and thought processes so he doesn't spiral as uncontrollably and destructively.\n\nBecause it's been a cycle that hasn't really changed for almost 3 years, I really would appreciate any suggestions about what I should look into.",

Of course, my mom wanted me to succeed academically and immediately took me to a doctor and had me diagnosed with a mild form of ADD. She got me kids focus medication (which I hated because they were so gross). This immediately became an argument between my mom and dad. My dad said that I was just a kid and that ADD isn't real. And I, not liking the taste of the tablets, was on his side. So I stopped taking the tablets and went back to mediocre progress in school, still better than most, mediocre effort nonetheless.\n\nMy mom has told me she's disappointed in me countless times since then. It broke my heart every time she said it. And I'd start crying...and she'd say \"You have nothing to cry about\". All I ever wanted since childhood was to make my parents happy, for them to encourage me, to be able to make them proud. My dad said that mental health wasn't something that you asked for help with. It was something you dealt with on your own, in silence.\n\nSo I just stopped telling them when I felt depressed or hurt or lonely. I honestly felt like a burden to them, a constant failure, a freak. And when I was sexually assaulted by an older boy at 15, I said nothing. When I cut myself, I said nothing. I pretended it never happened. And when they asked me if I was ok, I told them I was fine and they had nothing to worry about.\n\nI graduated highschool 2 years ago and finally felt a sense of hope in my life. My mom was so excited for me to go to college. Looking back I don't even really think I wanted to go right away, I mentioned this sometime in highschool and she said I was going to college whether I liked it or not. Verbatim \"you're either going to college or you're going to a graveyard\" I still don't even know what that meant. But I was so eager for her approval that I went without fully fathoming what that would involve. \n\nAnd I failed the first semester, second semester, changed majors to what they thought I'd be good at, failed 2/4 classes, and had the biggest argument with my mom I've ever had. \n\nHere I am now. My mom has accused me of doing drugs and hiding things from her. Called me manipulative and lazy. Told me that I'm wasting my life and that I'll never be anything of worth. Said passive aggressive comments about my body. Talked behind my back about me to my aunt's and uncles.\n\n\nAnd just now, when I finally got the courage to tell them I think I'm depressed and need medical help my dad sighed and walked away. My mom just looked at me with this apathetic look. And then I took it back. \"Nevermind\" I said. \n\nAnd she walked away. \n\nI'm so hopeless.",

I only have like 30 or so credits but recently have been feeling like I just want to start over and pursue my dream of entertainment.

Everyone sees me things extremely successful and extremely powerful and as a result I am left out with no support system whatsoever and no one to lean on.

We were chatting every night, it was so cool, for the next part of the story you'll need the fact that I'm one of the best in my class at 3 subjects : Geography, History and Social Education (idk how is it called in other nations but there we learn our rights and civil education).  \nWe had this test coming at Social Education and my crush asked me, probably joking, is she can sit with me at that test. And of course I sayed yes. We ended up staying all day toghater and we were having so much fun. BUT. This is the beguinning of the good period. In our friends group we have a friend, let's call him Eduard. Eduard is a good guy, and she was having a crush on that girl too, and they started talking too, A LOT. What needs to be added is that Eduard was added to our group BY ME, after i've added my crush. And as I was saying he was talking a lot with her. But as friends, me and Eduard were equal for her. But I had an advantage, I was sitting with her at EVERY History and Geography class. And we started getting closer. I can say I was superior in real life, while Eduard was superior online.  \nEverything was okay till we got quarantined, DURING THAT QUARANTIE I WAS TALKING TO HER NON-STOP, it was so great, and we got to know eachother better. I had found out she had a crush on a friend in our friend group. And that friend invited me and her to his birthday party, but she didn't wanted to come becuase she wasn't feeling okay in his presence. But she coudn't say that to him. And when she declined his invitation, HE ASKED ME, why did she declined, I was taken by surprise and.... coudn't keep my mounth shut, i told him the truth. But it was okay, she didn't knew that i had told him that. One week later, it was HER birthday, and I told her crush to wish her Happy Birthday. And... she saw me when i had sent that message... and she took my phone and scrolled more into my conversation with her crush and found out that I told him that \"she wasn't felling okay in his presence\".... From then she became a lot colder with me, and is giving Eduard all of the attention, it's like her revange for my mistakes. And every break-time is staying with Eduard. And I have to watch them. I SIMPLY CAN'T, My heart can't keep going like this. I still tell her evey night how much I regret what have I done, and she said she forgived me. but I don't bite it. I know that because she is still extremly cold. And I am still imagining how would my life be if : I never added Eduard to our friend group  and  If i'd never said to her crush that \"she isn't feeling confortable in his presence\".  \nBUT what's worse is that her crush dosen't even think she likes him.  \nSo yeah I had done a mistake and now I am feeling the consequences.  \nBut I suffer a lot, because I love her, and I never wanted this mix of gelousy and regret.  \nI need help please.",

Finally having that social circle made me desperate to cling onto it, and I became kind of an asshole. I didn\u2019t physically hurt anyone, but I\u2019m still ashamed of that period of my life and my behaviour. I\u2019ve worked hard to change it since.\n\n\nLately what\u2019s been bothering me is I get these periods, lasting about half a day to a day, once or twice a week where I feel \u201cmorally overwhelmed\u201d. I hyperanalyze my decisions and even analyze fictional situations (i.e what is the morally correct/nicest thing to do in x scenario) to ensure that I\u2019d make the right choice. I beat myself up over even like, laughing at jokes. \n\nIt is debilitating- I can\u2019t focus on anything else once these periods commence, and it ruins my enjoyment of life- I\u2019m a dark comedy kinda guy, and I can\u2019t enjoy even the most lighthearted of jokes now (i.e a joke that mentions being poor and I start spiralling feeling awful for laughing at poverty. Yes, it\u2019s that bad).

I, of course try to reply as fast as I can to their topic, but it just seems more and more tiring to see this very one sided conversation where I send 30+ messages and all I get in return is a reply that doesn't even relate to the subject whatsoever.

It's a content editing job for a startup company that works from 9 to 6. The pay's kinda good (at least I think it is?) but the way to the office is very long and the office itself feels very suffocating, with little to no sunlight, which kinda sucks.\n\nSo I have this weird thing that I found ever since my internship, if I work full time then right in the middle of the day my body would feel extremely nauseous, with symptoms like feeling hard to breathe, wanting to puke but nothing comes out (I think they're called dry heaving?) and very slimy saliva. Usually I would take some coffee or vitamin c (those kinda tablets that can dissolve in water, orange-flavored) to reduce the risk of it happening, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Today was my first time working full time again after some very long time, so I guess my body's not exactly used to it, but experiencing those symptoms again gave me a lot of concern for my long term health.\n\nIs this a thing? Do I have anxiety? I'm actually very scare of social interaction and just the thought of answering the phone scares me to no end. I also have some very traumatic experience with a part time job during my uni's life that left me with some ptsd-like symptom (the phone-scaring that I mentioned) and a extreme fear of toxic work environment (it helps me turn on my survival mode and stand up for myself if I feel something's unjust, but I'm pretty sure that's a hindrance for me if i want to have a good job in the future)\n\nI tried really hard to suppress these fears and supposed anxiety, but they never got better, and I'm getting worse at tolerating these reactions. Are these anxieties? Should I seek professional help?\n\nI'm from Vietnam by the way, and people's knowledge on mental health is just...very misinformed or ignorant, I'm not even sure where I can get a good therapist/psychologist around here. My parents also says that it's something everyone has to deal with and it will pass, but they're not exactly experts on anything mental health related (they were the reason for a lot of my current sufferings, which included some suicidal thoughts) and I'm not exactly sure if I'm being gaslighted into believing that it's not a mental problem.

I am currently schooling and more than 50% of my friends have some form of mental health disorder- anxiety, depression, adhd etc. i am not really sure about how I feel about this (I don\u2019t want to invalidate anyone). As a generation, we have become so desensitised to mental health conditions that we have lost the ability to experience emotions regularly. We see all emotions through a psychological lens and normal emotions such as sadness is immediately labeled as depression which causes a self fulfilling loop where the person keeps telling themselves they are sad and ends up being depressed. And people don\u2019t feel validated for their emotions unless they are diagnosed with a mental health condition so a lot of people to some extent exaggerates their emotions and experiences to get help. This is so concerning to me because now the norm is no longer being mentally stable and having a mental health disorder is almost seen as a personality trait that makes u cooler.",

Seemingly always when I masturbate and almost immediately go to bed &amp; sleep. I don't think much of it, but then I wake up in a panic every 15 minutes, feeling physically bad, and usually accompanied by a large headache (I'm not headache prone, usually), body overheating...just feeling something is very much wrong, very uncomfortable, but I'm half asleep, so I can't process any reason while I'm feeling like that, and it still doesn't make sense later when I wake up. I just sleep horribly, very worried &amp; panicky. I think there is a thought out there that masturbation should help you sleep more soundly, if anything. \n\nI tried 5 minutes of box breathing before bed last night, and it didn't help, unfortunately.\n\nThankfully this doesn't happen super often (although once or twice a month is too much for my liking, especially since I don't masturbate often), but yeah it's very uncomfortable and makes me wonder \"WTF?\". I guess people having their own issues with masturbation is probably not uncommon. It's not something we can talk about with others (at least not me), and there is a degree of shame associated with it, even though I know there shouldn't be. I'm not religious or anything so not sure if it's a guilt thing or just some weird anxiety thing I don't understand. It's probably not something I would ever bring up with a therapist, just too embarrassing (again that's just me talking), but I'm not sure how I would fix something like this anyways. Might be something to do with hormones or endorphins? No idea.\n\nlooking for advice, thanks.",

    "text": "Hello, r/mentalhealth. This is a long post, but I beg you to bear with me. I'm desperately seeking answers.  \n\n\nI've been diagnosed with a wide variety of physical and mental health conditions over the last 10 years, which I suspect are caused or, at least, exacerbated by an infection in my body. My wife and I have spent years and 10s of thousands of dollars trying to find answers, and I finally received this diagnosis in early 2021. I am currently in the long and arduous process of treating it. I mention this because the infection has caused continual meningitis and swelling in my brain, and mental illness is complex and multi-faceted, having many different causes. I'm not sure to what extent, if at all, this has and is impacting my mental health, but I suspect it has a part to play.  \n\n\nI've been clinically diagnosed with bipolar depression and general anxiety, and for a long time, thought it ended there. I've always been a 'perfectionist' and over the years have allowed myself to rationalize it because I've gotten a lot of positive attention for it. People see my elevated attention to detail and procedural thinking as an asset, which it certainly can be, but this has caused me to completely disregard the negative impact it is having on my life.  \n\n\nI used to think it was a relatively minor issue, but recently, stress has seemed to stir it up to a debilitating degree. My wife and I have moved around a lot for her job and to be closer to family due to my poor health. This last time we moved, I had a moment of epitome and finally realized just how much these thought patterns are ruling over me.   \n\n\nMoving is a stressful event for most people, but for me, it was devastating. It was a very tactile reminder of all of the imperfections in all my belongings. Pulling out item after item and seeing how they weren't up to my standards really sent me into a spiral. I started putting my things in a pile that I intended to throw out and replace, simply because they had small blemishes. When my wife finally stopped me and made me realize how insane I was being, I saw that there were thousands of dollars of items in the pile that I intended on throwing away and replacing. The pile is still sitting in the living room, and the thought of sorting back through it and putting things away brings me an overwhelming amount of anxiety.  \n\n\nYesterday, on my day off, I intended on running some errands. I drove into town and immediately, things were not going the way I had planned for them to. I suddenly became very stressed and anxious, and developed this weird feeling of depersonalization--like I was watching my own life on a movie screen, but not directly involved. I stopped in the middle of my errands, and drove back to my apartment so that I could 'start over' on the errands. Instead of doing what I could after I had driven into town for 20 minutes, I elected to drive back and restart them, hoping things would go my way, which they did not. I came back and tried to just go to sleep, but again, I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack, and couldn't drift into sleep.  \n\n\nSeveral years ago, I was seeing a different counselor than I am now, who suspected that I might suffer from OCD. At the time, I had just broken up with my girlfriend of three years. It was a very manipulative and abusive relationship, and really messed me up. The thing that made her suspect OCD was my compulsion to lock my vehicle. I would lock it. Unlock it, and lock it again. Unlock it, open the door, check the locking mechanism, and relock it. Walk about 20 feet, press the fob and hear the horn honk, doubt that it actually locked, walk back, and repeat the same process. Walk across campus to class, and sometimes leave in the middle of a lecture, walk back across campus, and check to make sure it was locked. This behavior lasted for about four months. I had what I now recognize as a manic episode, cancelled my appointments with my counselor at that time, never seeing her again, and then moved to a different city, so I forgot until recently that this was ever something that came up as a possibility.  \n\n\nThis isn't a compulsion I suffer from anymore, but I do have cyclical thought patterns that come up every once-in-a-while. Sometimes I will suddenly have an irrational fear that I am going to sleepwalk and kill my wife in my sleep, and the thought repeats itself for hours as I am trying to drift into sleep. Or sometimes the phrase, \"Hail Satan\" will start to repeat in my head, which is terrifying to me as I am a Christian. About a year ago, I was dealing with suicidal ideation, and for days at a time, thoughts like, \"You should kill yourself, you worthless piece of shit,\" would be on repeat in my head. It was like the thought was stuck on a loop, and even when I was thinking of other things, I could almost hear the thought looping in the background. (For those concerned, I am doing much better now and have a safety plan in place in case this every occurs again.)  \n\n\nI have many other examples, but have only recently been starting to catalogue them, as I am only now realizing how much of a problem this is. I would be happy to give more details in the comments, but I don't want to waste any more of your time, and this post is already long enough. I know that no one here can diagnose me, and that's not what I'm asking for. I just want to know: does this sound like just 'perfectionism', or should I look into getting evaluated for OCD? I am currently seeing a counselor, but none of this, besides the suicidal ideation, have I brought up. But I think it's time to deal with it.",

    "text": "Sorry for the long post!!\n\nMy ex (33M) just broke up with me (22F) after I visited him in the US. He didn\u2019t break up with me while I stayed with him but he broke up with me after I came back to my country on the phone. We were in a long distance relationship for 1 year, and he doesn\u2019t wanna do online date nights or text frequently anymore because he feels forced. \n\nI met him in Australia 2 years ago. I usually went to his place once or twice a week. We didn\u2019t really discuss about relationship but I really liked him. And he said \u201c do you like being my girl?\u201d by voice chat. So I thought I was dating with him at the time. But he had been seeing some girls as well which he had never mentioned.\n\nWhen he left Australia, he asked me that if I wanna continue this relationship. I said yes, and I asked him \u201care you my boyfriend?\u201d And he said yes. So we started dating officially??  Also, he wrote a letter that said\n\u201cI\u2019ve never liked anyone as much as I like you\u201d. Even though, he married twice.( he had divorced already tho)\n\nAfter he went back to the US, he started to hike on the Appalachien trail. And he started ignoring my texts and stopped contacting with me. We talked about me visiting him and hiking together before he started hiking, but he said it\u2019s not a good idea because hiking is too tough. Then he suggested me to see other people and he told me that he is now seeing the girl on the trail. When he mentioned about her, he described her as \u201cjust a hiking things\u201d.\nAfter that, He said he wanted to try poly relationship. This is the first time I heard about polyamory from him. But later, he told me he was solo poly in Australia which I didn\u2019t know.\n\nI still really liked him. So I decided to try poly relationship. But I was struggling with jealousy and insecurity probably because I didn\u2019t see him for a year and  he and the girl from the trail live in the same city.\nBut anyway, finally, I would be able to visit him in the US and stay for few weeks.\n\nI really enjoyed spending time with him. We went to a lot of places and had wonderful dinner. But when we went out, he used his phone a lot and I wasn\u2019t really sure if he is enjoying or not. And one time I saw him texting his other partner when we went on the date. I felt like he cannot stop thinking of other partner even we went on the date. Also, once he told me that he doesn\u2019t use his phone when he is with someone. But when he is with me, he uses his phone a lot?? I wasn\u2019t sure that if I am his important person or not, then I felt insecure about it.\n\nI wasn\u2019t so mature and I cried a lot because of my insecurities. I should\u2019ve told him that how I felt more. But it\u2019s too late.\n\nI wanted to continue this relationship even we are in LDR. So I asked him that what\u2019s gonna be like before I left. But he just said \u201c it\u2019s going to be less cuddling and we could talk about it later when you get back home.\u201d\n\nIt was a painful flight and I messaged him on the plane. I asked him that I wanna know when I can see you again. Then he said he hasn\u2019t known yet, but probably in Europe or my country.\n\nAfter I got back home, we talked on the phone. He asked me about my plan first. I told him that not seeing him for a year was too tough. I wanna see you at least twice a year. Then he started talking about his thoughts.\n\nWhat he was saying is,\n\n1, he doesn\u2019t wanna online date nights or frequent text, because he feels forced.\n\n2, he has been expected me to be his vacation friend. ( not frequently talking each other but traveling together sometime)\n\n3, when we stayed together, I was so insecure and it was annoying. He lost interests in me.\n\n4, staying in other countries for few weeks cost us a lot. And he cannot do that.\n\n5,if I could move to the US, he would like to see me again.\n\nThen he just broke up with me after I got back home. I paid for airplane, visa, COVID test(it\u2019s so expensive actually), taxi (from airport to his place, and his place to airport),\nsome souvenirs for him.\nAlso, Even though he is 11 years older than me, he is broke. So I tried not to be burden financially. I got some lunch, dinner, drinks.\n\nI thought I did almost everything I could do for him. But I felt like I lost a lot of things, money, time, great memories\u2026\n\nAnd I wish he broke up with me before I left in the US, then I didn\u2019t have to drag this feeling into my country.\n\nNow, I hate him so much. The more I hate him, the more I will become the person I don\u2019t wanna be. I just wanna know how to forget those memories and just move on.\n\nThank you for reading those long story.\nI think I just wanted to share my sad feelings\u2026\n\nP.S. he promised me that he won\u2019t break up with my after this visit. I don\u2019t know why this guy could easily promise what he couldn\u2019t. But I should be glad not to be dragged by this guy anymore.",

    "text": "I've never posted before, and I'm not sure if this is the place to put this. I don't know if I need support or just people to read my story. I've been with this man for 12 years. We have a daughter who is turning 10 this year. I really think I hate him. I feel like my self-esteem is so low, and he's made me hate myself also. I've always struggled with depression. \nHe's a constant liar, he does things like disappear all night and say he had to make an out of state delivery for work, but cant respond to any of my messages or calls while hes gone. He leaves and won't say where he's going. I feel like he tries to sneak out while we are distracted, so we can't even ask.\nThere's so much I could say, but this isn't even about him. It's about me. Over the years, I've changed so much. I look back on who I used to be, and I miss that person. I've gained an insane amount of weight. I barely leave my house; I don't even own any makeup anymore. \nI'm trying to make changes in my life, but I'm so afraid of failing. I've done this before, started the first steps of leaving this man, and getting my own place. The thought of being alone and doing everything by myself is overwhelming. Last time, I ended up in a downward spiral that ended with me in the mental hospital and cutting my hours back to part-time because I couldn't take any amount of stress anymore. I've been on part-time for a couple of years now. I actually have been feeling mentally improved. I'm working more hours, and I'm scheduled for weight loss surgery this month. I feel hopeful for the future, but I am so scared at the same time. \nI always have it in the back of my mind that I'm going to fail. That I can't rely on myself to keep working and pay my rent and bills by myself. Ever since that last breakdown, I feel mentally weak. I can't handle any significant amount of stress. I keep telling myself it's because I've shut myself off from everything for so long. I try to think positive, I'm doing all the right things. It's been months since I've had to call into work, and I've gone from working 20 hours a week to 28. I plan to go back to full time after I heal from my surgery, so I can save more money to move.\nI planned on saving for this year and moving at the beginning of next year, but yesterday this man left in the morning while I was at work and was gone for 10 hours. He wouldn't answer his phone; he came home stinking of beer and claimed he was out paying bills. I don't even fight with him anymore. I try to act like it doesn't bother me, but it does. A lot. I want to move now and not deal with this anymore. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I'm desperately trying to learn to rely on myself and trust myself again, to find that confident person that I used to be.",

    "text": "There is a lot, lot, lot I could go into details of, but the past 5 years or so have not been kind to my mom\u2019s mental state. She 56 and we live in GA, USA. \n\n1. She has stopped working for the family business after an argument with another family member\n2. stopped taking care of the house or cooking\n3. had many health issues that were likely mostly psychosomatic (things like lice but also constant sinus or eye infections)\n4. most importantly, has become absolutely convinced my dad has cheated on her and spends hours each day scanning his call logs, location, text messages, googling and buying number-lookups from sites to see who he\u2019s contacting, etc. \n\nBasically, each and every one of those things listed is a pretty major facet of some mental health issue. She has been seeing a psychiatrist for a decade and been prescribed anti-depressants and tried tweaking doses to see what works, so she HAS been engaged with the process. However, a MAJOR red flag is I believe she intentionally does not take her medicine as directed (morning pills as night, skipping entire days/weeks, etc). \n\nHowever, it seems since especially the pandemic, it was turned to an 11 and she spends literally 5+ hours a day chain smoking on the porch poring over her phone to find some evidence of cheating. My dad cheated back in 1997 and finally admitted it in 2015 or something, so there IS precedent, but I truly believe he has not cheated since then, based on all of her \u201cevidence\u201d. \n\nDuring the pandemic she has become extremely irrational and irate, especially in the middle of the night after being on her phone for hours. She\u2019ll start yelling at my dad that he\u2019s a serial cheater, a drug addict (also not true), lied to her the entire marriage, it\u2019s his fault the house is a wreck (bordering hoarder-level, mostly her stuff but my dad also contributes), and has recently begun saying she wishes she was dead. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s a line she\u2019s crossed, both for her own mental state and to put on my dad. I have it in text message form and directly overheard her during a tirade a few hours ago. \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI feel like contacting her psychiatrist is the objectively correct answer, but I believe that would have her involuntarily committed to a mental hospital which feels like going the nuclear option without giving her the choice. Is my assumption that she\u2019d be involuntarily committed true?\n\nI do not truly think she\u2019s at risk of actually committing suicide, but there\u2019s been an increasing pattern and something needs to be done. \n\nWhat are other options regarding voluntarily going to a mental hospital? I truly think she needs to be forced away from her phone and given her medicine on a schedule so she can reset. She is noticeably sane, lucid, and kind when she consistently takes her anti-depressants so I know there\u2019s hope.  \n\nI just want her to be in the most stable mental state as she has been threatening divorce because of cheating that never happened with fantasized or very situational \u201cproof\u201d, to the point it\u2019s left reality. She\u2019s fully in her right to divorce for the cheating from 1997, but my dad can\u2019t prove he hasn\u2019t cheated since then and finding the evidence has become part of her entire identity. If separating will be healthiest, then it needs to happen, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the correct option if she\u2019s in a better state. \n\nSorry if I seem callous or insensitive towards her, I have many similar issues with anxiety and depression, but she has turned into a bully that seeks to make my dad and everyone around her feel terrible because of her own struggles.

When I was 18 (now 21), I was SA\u2019d repeatedly when I was drunk by my bf and in my 2nd year somebody I thought was my friend attempted to SA me in a bathroom. I decided to drop out just before exams as I was not getting any sleep and could not focus on anything. I was diagnosed with depression, agoraphobia and anxiety and the school agreed that I could retake the year. By September I was still awful, up to this point I was on a waiting list through the NHS for counselling and the school told me that they could offer support. This did not happen. I travelled by bus to school and it made me extremely anxious. Some days I would have panic attacks before even getting to school. As well as this I would go hungry the whole day, I could not eat without throwing up so I was constantly tired and dizzy.  I tried at first attending classes, but I was constantly anxious and did not focus on anything, I\u2019m terrible with noise and light and this can really set me off. I decided I would be better off going to this quiet study room for students with any problems. This still made me anxious but was a better alternative to a class with a lot of noise. My teachers were happy with this compromise, they would send me the work and I would see them at the end of the week to show them I had done it. By October I was called in by somebody, I had never met her before. She took me to a room in the library and basically said, you can either start going to class or you can leave. This whole conversation caught me off guard, I was not prepared for this type of decision and she wanted an answer there and then. I had asked if there was anything I could do, if there was a way to be integrated into the classroom over time but no. It was either shut up and get on with it or leave basically. So I left. I was just as bad as I was the year prior so there was no point in staying if I couldn\u2019t get any help. The worst part is, that was the year the pandemic started and students did not have to take their exams. \n\nI want to know if there\u2019s anything I can do? If I can get my predicted grades the same as everybody else that year. I put in so much effort into my A levels, but now I have nothing to show for the two years of attending sixth form.",

    "text": "sorry, couldnt figure out how to post the actaul video.   https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZNMmrKBj-H/?utm_medium=share_sheet     Ive been dealing with some regular life issues lately, and it's nothing new, but this time everything feels like it's all crashing down at once. I won't go into much detail so I don't bore you or traumatize anyone else but over 26 years old and I do understand that I made my own decisions and choices along the way, and even though they weren't the best decisions I'm still here and I wouldn't give up anything that I've learned from life. but this video really spoke to me because I had a serious talk with my girlfriend last night and she basically said all of this to me except she meant it as if she believes that's how men should be yet she is a year away from getting a PhD in social psychology so I know she understands all of this much better than I do, she teaches it for heaven's sake. but I'll post my relationship troubles on a different subreddit cuz that's a whole another can of worms I don't want to open right now. but all in all I am pretty sure I'm going to distance myself from her at least for a little bit and try to work on myself because I'm lost and I'm not really too sure what to do. in a nutshell, I grew up with an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who wasn't there emotionally, I was raised in the Jehovah's witness religion which enforced my parents to shield us from the world and everything going on in it, this is really embarrassing and I honestly hope not a lot of people read this post but my parents shame to me in front of my sisters when I was 12 years old and told me that it was wrong and not a normal thing to do the time I got caught masturbating to pornography. my father did not sit down and talk with me about it, he punished me with about and grounded me. I grew up not knowing why something was wrong only that you get punished if somebody says it's wrong. I was sent to therapy for that and it gave me a bad taste and I stood away from anything that had to do with my mental health for the rest of my teenage years and I really feel like it had a tremendous negative effect because I don't fit in with anyone but I can blend into a crowd anywhere, I hate being lonely but I love being alone. I want to be social but I never know how to have a conversation with another adult because my only father figures that I could look to for boys my age and all I did was get me into trouble. and I look now at people I went to high school with who have their careers going and already bought their own houses and have cars and starting families. and I'm still over here skating to work every night with not a penny in my savings account and I was never professionally diagnosed as a younger person for any kind of mental problems. my parents believe that that was all in your head. I guess I'm just venting now and trying to get what I can out so it's not bothering me anymore. I don't know how else to turn to though because the second I try to open up to my significant other she tells me don't think about it today think about it tomorrow. but it upsets her when she knows something is bothering me and I don't talk about it or say anything if I do though, she tells me not to complain and man up. I'm doing my damn best to keep going forward, but I keep getting side swiped by everything. my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in December right before Christmas and had a hysterectomy in January. my father got drunk as usual and one night decided he was going to hit her in the stomach where she had her surgery and he's not that type of drunk to forget what happens, he knows what he does because he likes to remind everybody the following days. I have defended and looked out for my mother for as long as I can remember from him and he is a 6'3 250 lb guy who intimidates everybody he crosses except for me and I've gone through so much I've been kicked out multiple times from their house, beaten in the backyard, left to literally outside in the rain because every time he put hands on her I would put hands on him. this last time was supposed to be the last time, and yet she still took him back. two of my sisters moved out of state and they both don't talk to me still because they have weird feelings about everything that happened when we were younger and how my dad changed me and basically told them that I was a bad person and a pervert and to never be alone in a room with me, I didn't realize that he was a root and wall between my sisters and I ever having a decent real loving relationship as a family should. we were raised in a cult, yes Jehovah's witness is a cult. it is broken down and to find the exact same way Scientology is and Mormonism just different teachings and their own take on it. anyone's allowed to come and hear them or visit their Church, but as one of them you are never allowed to explore another religion for any reason. it is just a very manipulative and controlling place. our extended family stop talking to us because of that and I was stuck in that religion from the age of five to 16 and that's when I told my father that if he made me go to another one of those meetings, I was going to make sure that everybody in that church knew the type of person he was at home compared to how he acts over there. I'm currently staying with a friend and I'm more than grateful for the room and it's a really good price, but he has a drug problem and decided to go steal his mother's check and blow more than half of it on all kinds of dumb shit. she came to me and asked me for help with the house payment this month my rent basically shot up to 1600 and I do work a full-time job but out of here in California I bring home 1600 for the entire month before bills and necessities. she needs it in less than 2 weeks. I basically don't have a choice because if I don't help I won't have anywhere to live. I have a 3-year-old daughter who's going to be four in a few weeks and I haven't gotten to see her in almost a year because after her mother found out that I ended up dating someone who's basically the complete opposite of her way after we were separated for a while, she decided that she didn't want any other woman around her daughter and that I was not going to be able to see her because I'm not on the birth certificate because when she was born my dumbass for sitting in prison. she refuses to sign any paternal papers and at the moment I don't have money for a lawyer but she already made it clear that she will fight for full custody and try to keep me out of her daughter's life because if I left her then I shouldn't deserve to be in my daughter's life. which is according to her. so yeah if there's any buddy who knows anyone else who's gone through even one of these things or has themselves anybody who has any fatherly advice that they can give me, that's all I'm asking for. I never needed my dad to tell me he loved me I never needed validation or for him to say he's proud of me and I always thought that I did, but in all honesty all I really need is to have a conversation with a dad. I don't know a damn thing about my dad's childhood or his upbringing he never sat down and told me stories about his past or anything never gave me advice the only thing he ever told me and I was a fool to listen was to never get a credit card because credit is bad. I spent a good amount of my teens and the first few years of my first jobs thinking credit was bad and if you need a credit you aren't doing well coming from somebody who had no credit and was living paycheck to paycheck. he had no care for my future and well-being it's either that or he just didn't know how to do it which is not a very smart move to have four children and not know what the hell you're doing with your life. I can't blame him for the problems I have but I sure as hell can hold and responsibility for all of his actions. if anybody still reading this far I give you the utmost respect and thank you for listening. I promise you I will feel it when you finish reading this it will hit me and I won't know that somebody took a few minutes out of their day to care about what somebody else is going through and to listen to what they had to say. and he's more than you will ever know to me so thank you..",

    "text": "Ok here is a bit of a back story. \nAs a child my mother suspected I had OCD.\nAge 12 first bout with severe depression. \nAge 15 developed anorexia. \nAge 19 glandular fever-&gt; chronic fatigue syndrome (ongoing until current but manageable) \nRestored to a healthy weight (did a year of ED treatment) but struggled with Binge Eating Disorder for years after.\nNaturally slim so didn\u2019t become \u2018obese\u2019.\nAge 20 relapsed in to anorexia as chronic fatigue was becoming life-ruining. \nAge 21 discovered meth. \nWas a \u2018recreational\u2019 meth addict for 5 years, then became an every day user for 3 years, half of that time used intravenously. \nDuring my time as a meth addict I essentially felt \u2018cured\u2019 of my chronic fatigue and eating disorders- it was amazing. I would take those years over the years of suffering prior to that any day of the week. Of course, I started to hate my addiction and decided to get clean a year ago. I went to outpatient rehab for a year and am not interested in using again. \n\nThe problem here lies that of course my original maladies returned. I don\u2019t believe I have CFS anymore, but I have some lingering symptoms that I\u2019m working on with a nutritional doctor. My eating disorder returned and mutated to bulimia. I had bulimic tendencies in the past but in the past 6 months it is really out of control. To the point that I would have a B/P episode every day where I would purge 4-8 times a day/night. \n\nAt rehab everyone that is at the same stage as me seems to not have these lingering issues I have. They have sorted their shit out and going great, able to work on themselves and the reason they started using is able to be worked through and overcome etc. Most days I have ZERO motivation. I started uni but can\u2019t concentrate. I have no drive to do things. I\u2019m tired all the time but then can\u2019t sleep. So, I started to self - medicate with dextamphetamine, vyvanse and clonazepam &amp; nitrazepam (to sleep) about 3 months ago. When I take them I don\u2019t binge and purge. I HAVE to stop doing it- my teeth are getting too sensitive and one chipped last week. but this literally doesn\u2019t stop me. it\u2019s a compulsion i don\u2019t feel like i can control. When I take the medications I get things done and want to exist in the world, things don\u2019t seem so hugely overwhelming and anxiety-producing. \n\nI have done TONNES of therapy and am still seeing a good psychologist. I just feel like no matter how much therapy I do, my brain still feels broken. I don\u2019t feel normal. I don\u2019t know if I have depression or ADHD or both. Seeing my doctor tomorrow for a psychiatrist referral.. \n\nAny insights welcome\u2026feeling like I just want to succeed and enjoy life but I keep getting in my own way.",

    "text": "I have been on a downward spiral.\n\nI was always the smart and talented overachiever in my early years up until middle school. Heck, I was top of my class in middle school. Ever since then, however, things became worse.\n\nMy grades started slipping in high school because I was having trouble getting work done. It never got *too* bad though; I was doing fine enough to get by and I still consistently made honors in some capacity, but there were times I even missed it.\n\nI don't know if it was because I actually had to study to grasp information or my brain being dumb, but I couldn't work efficiently at all during these years. I handed several assignments in late or last minute, barely passed some tests, and even had to outright rely on a friend to pass a class. I was constantly tired and demotivated, and didn't join many clubs at all because of that.\n\nWhile my other peers were constantly recognized by teachers, had great relationships with them, and were recognized in other areas like National Honors Society, I was left with a nice friend group, but not much else. I did have a nice support system that included said friends, my guidance counselor, and a teacher or two, I got no fulfillment out of high school.\n\nThis all culminated into one day in January last year\nwhere I had a mental breakdown. I was feeling bummed out because of all of what I said plus the fact that I realized I was trans. I had sent a concerning email to my guidance counselor which prompted them to call me and speak to my parents to let them know. While the phone call between the counselor and my mother went smoothly enough. Once the phone cut off, I was yelled at for a good 15 or so minutes.\n\nApparently, I didn't \"put myself out there,\" I shouldn't have been feeling the way I felt, my parents did a lot to raise me and my sister after coming from so little, I should've said something, etc. My mom was crying out of anger and frustration, my sister cried, and I cried because I felt like a horrible, stupid, idiot who did this to themselves because I didn't try hard enough. \n\nAfter that debacle, my mom cooled off and reassured me, but I couldn't feel or eat afterwards. Looking back on that day makes me so angry, upset, and sad. My friend said that the experience may have been traumatic, but I don't know how to feel about that. When I mentioned therapy, my mom was against it because it meant that she \"went wrong somewhere,\" so I repressed a lot of things for a bit and went to my guidance counselor regularly without mentioning them.\n\nNow I'm in college and when I got here, I was hoping for a fresh start. Things seemed fine for the first month or so, but everything crashed and burned afterwards. I dropped my chemistry and calculus classes because I was failing both pretty badly, and I barely passed other classes and had to work myself to exhaustion to finish final assignments for said classes. \n\nNow here I am in my second semester. I started to skip classes because the prospect of going made me feel anxious, guilty, and dreadful. I am constantly on edge and me getting so much as a phone call makes me anxious. I've been placed on an academic warning, I'm currently failing all my classes, everyone else is doing better than me, and I'm overall not happy. I'm only ever in a good mood when I'm with my friend group, and other times I'm exhausted, in pain, indulging in self-loathing/hatred, having suicidal thoughts, not able to do the things I like, etc. In addition, my roommate smokes and has constant sex with his girlfriend. It's infuriating. I told him abiut it, but nothing much changed. Addiction also makes me feel horrible and shameful, and has caused me to do things I really regret, but keep falling back into.\n\nSo much is happening, too. I have huge crush on someone. (We're great friends and she seems to maybe reciprocate, but she is very hard to read and super vague in general and has expressed that things like that make her awkward, which I totally get.) I'm also craving intimacy and physical affection and just want a bunch of hugs. I am figuring my identity out and I'm trying to lean into it a bit more, but constantly seeing people want those like me gone because of who I am makes me want to not exist. I recently had an epiphany and realized I would be happier pursuing a career in comics/film/animation, but seeing how hard it is to make it in those fields is discouraging.\n\nI am seeing counseling in college, but that's not doing much. I don't feel alive anymore. My mom has been trying to help me with my mental health issues, a complete 180 from last year, and I'm grateful. However, that resentment for that day still eats at me and I really want to tell her how that made me feel because she still (rarely) references it saying that it was (basically) my fault. I'm still trying to unlean that but it's still not setting in for me.\n\nRight now I have a class in a few hours and I don't want to go. I don't think I can do it. I've basically given up at this point. I am sick and tired of living and the more I try to change or get help, nothing happens. I've been lookimg for therapy for a year now. Now I'm even scared of that because if I get help and still do poorly, that just means I'm irredeemable.\n\nBut finally, I've said all this and more to several friends by burdening them with my vents. I don't even know why I'm posting here when nothing will even happen. I hate existing and wish I could just disappear for a while. This world and the people in it are garbage and to them I am garbage.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nLife is falling apart and college is going horribly. I also have a plethora of other issues that just makes existence an absolutely tiring nightmare. I've been living with this for a while now and can't take it anymore.",

    "text": "I've had depression and anxiety (especially social anxiety) for about 8 years and throughout that time have had multiple rounds of CBT and many months of counselling with about 5 different people (including free counselling from school/uni, paid counselling, NHS counselling). \n\nCBT always helps a tiny bit, but doesn't help me actually change or overcome things. For example it helped me change from sleeping through the day to waking up at 8am, but it didn't actually help with my social anxiety. Partly because the main point of CBT is exposing yourself to situations, but I don't have many situations - I'm unemployed, no friends, barely any family and I don't really speak to them. \n\nAny time that I don't have access to counselling, I feel this sense that I desperately need counselling, I need to talk to someone, I need help. But then every time I've had counselling, it doesn't seem to help in any way?\n\nI really don't mean this in an arrogant way, but I already know what they're going to say. There's only so many breathing techniques and mindfulness, and I've heard a lot of them from talking therapy in the past. And then for my own personal problems, it's my life, so I've already thought about every possible outcome of every situation/choice, I've already thought about all the things I could do to improve things. So I just get frustrated by counselling because I tell them the problem, they tell me what I've already thought of, and that's about it. \n\nI don't know what else I expect/want. I know therapists can't just tell me what to do with my life, I know they can't fix anything for me. But I need something different than just \"so how does that make you feel\" and \"I understand that can be overwhelming, be kind to yourself and try this grounding technique\". I think I'm a bit beyond that. What I need is a normal functioning life. \n\nI don't really know what I wanted to get out of this post, maybe to see if anyone feels the same way? Or does anyone know of any alternative forms of therapy that might be more proactive?",

    "text": "I\u2019m sure you all know where this is going but let me explain. I have this mental block that I never let myself reach out for help. I always figure if there was something wrong with me I would know. I\u2019m constantly scared I\u2019m lying to myself and believing that lie and nothing is actually wrong with me. Anyway, enough rambling.. so I have always struggled in school. I\u2019d procrastinate till the last minute on every assignment, can never stay motivated, when teachers gave lectures I HAVE to take notes otherwise it\u2019s just like noise being thrown at me and my mind thinks about whatever is most interesting to me in that moment. Even then I struggle to motivate myself to take notes and ended up cheating a lot in school. I can barely follow through on any project I have unless I\u2019m being paid. I love working (even though it\u2019s a desk job, I have another one too tho and it\u2019s a waitress job) because I know I\u2019m making money. The only other time I can follow through on stuff is baking and I have no idea why. I bake so many cookies. And usually it\u2019s only cookies. If it\u2019s a cake I have to decorate I can\u2019t finish it and just eat the cake, no frosting. Another thing is that my room and car get MESSY and I have zero motivation to clean unless I know my bf is coming over or something to that affect. Like, finding moldy stuff in my room CONSTANTLY. It\u2019s bad and makes me feel terrible which makes me want to do it even less. And talking about feeling terrible\u2026oml my emotions. Like if I\u2019m talking and realize who I\u2019m talking to isn\u2019t listening I completely shut down or like I get super anxious if someone\u2019s footsteps sound too angry. I literally cried on my way home after dropping off my bf after he spent like 2 days straight with me cause I thought he didn\u2019t find me attractive because of some \u201crelations\u201d that did not happen that I thought would. Anyway, I\u2019m writing all of this on my phone at 2 am because anytime I close my eyes I\u2019m just thinking and can\u2019t shut the hell up. I\u2019m there, eyes closed, brain ON. I hate it. I\u2019m getting so burnt out and I\u2019m constantly miserable. Usually when I\u2019m miserable I bake but now I have been banned from making cookies because my mom says I don\u2019t get rid of them fast enough and she ends up eating them. I just feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me. All these basic things seem to come naturally to everyone around me but for some reason I can\u2019t get my shit together. I just want to be a normal girl like the ones around me but damn I\u2019m so tired. Maybe this is all normal for a 19 y/o girl and I\u2019m overreacting but I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I\u2019m struggling to function, which does not help because I\u2019m trying to move across the country. Idk how I\u2019m going to survive if I can\u2019t take care of myself. I\u2019m just so lost and I\u2019m hoping this is all sorta normal cause I don\u2019t know if I could deal with that but I\u2019m at a point where I should figure that out. Idk what\u2019s wrong with me. Help.",

They mostly mean to put away my clothes in the closet, make my bed, clean out random papers from school or whatever from my desk etc.  \n\n\nIt really irritates me for two reasons:\n\n \\- I generally have issues with people trying to have control over me, so them telling me what to do, even if it's something that I would originally want or feel the need to do, makes me not want to do it at all;  \n\\- Building on the last point, I actually am trying to be a better more organized person and have my room more tidy as a result of that. So them telling me to do it, which in turns makes me not want to do it, aggravates me even more cause then I feel the need to not tidy my room which I have been tryind to do more consistently, and I end up with an untidy room that I don't want.  \n\n\nAll of this, especially after writing it out, seems like a petty, possibly immature response, but I don't know how to have them stop pestering me about it and I feel like the more they badger me with it, the more distance I feel between me and my family.

OK now that's out of the way...\n\nI think untreated or Sometimes treated mentally ill people would probably not be ideal parents if their mental illness is moderate to severe. I feel like it's offensive to believe that but at the same time having a mentally ill parent is listed as a trauma. My dad is mentally ill and I had a lot of recentment and daddy issues growing up, wishing that my parents never had Kids. I wanted to die and hated them for having me. My dad was unable to take care of us emotionally (he was a working provider though) and was abusive. I always was afraid I will turn Into my dad and it seems like I am sadly. I have decided even having a relationship is unatainable for me.\n\nSo I want to say I think if you have your mental illness under control to the point it's Mild you can probably be a great parent without the stress destroying you but if not then I don't see how the person would be able to cope with the challenges of a mental illness and having a kid without a lot of outside help and support.",

    "text": "So last year I had gotten with this amazing girl who we will code name \u201cSally\u201d\nSally was amazing, she had taught me so much about myself and what it felt like to be happy after so many years. I had always struggled to find happiness in relationships because nobody truely ever understood me in these relationships so I had never felt heard or could carry the ability to feel loved.\nHer family loved me ontop of it.\nBut Sally was different, she knew when I was hungry, when I was sad or happy so on and so on, but there was downsides to this relationship\nI had absolutely 0 support from any of my friends or family, they always made me pick and chose being happy or going out and being bored out of my mind. So I hid mine and sallys relationship from everyone but my mom\nShe wasnt super supportive of the relationship but bit her toung because she saw her son finally being happy after years.\nThe other hiccup is her best friend was more apart of the relationship than id like to admit and so was her own brother\nAnd I was friends with her brother before me and sally started dating. Now fast forward a month and a bit and me and Sally start having some more \u201cintimate\u201d time together. And it was good but not because it was my first time for these things but I also didnt have much of a say in these things, they kind of happend.\nAnd one day she stole my v-card which was not a bad first time but it also is one I wish I could change because she didnt really ask me if we could \u201cdo it\u201d it just happend on a night where I just wanted to watch movies with her and cheer up because I was quite down that day.\nAnd thats where things went downhill quickly within a week\u2026\nAt the school I went to we did a provincial and national competition in specialty classes like culinary, welding, cosmetology, and film and video production and I had my competition coming up that same week, and a crazy work week. So I was super stressed that week, and so it was Wednesday and I was working the night before my competition and it was a good day at the point of me working besides a argument I had with sally about how she was going to go back to her old ways (drugs) if she ever lost her dog as she was getting quite old with some medical issues. But we sorted it out. But something felt off when I was about to get off work. She had texted me asking if we could facetime after I was off. Which wasnt the off part as we would do that all the time. It was how she asked, (we usually talk on snap and if we texted thats when something was going on) and so when I saw the text something just felt off. I said \u201csure\u201d\u2026. (Now keep in mind this is the night before my competition where school recruiters will be watching our performance) I had called her when I was walking home and she looked almost soulless and she had said very dead panned \u201chey I think its best if me and you dont talk any more or have a relationship, I just dont think things are working out\u201d and I was speechless and just hung up and dropped in the middle of a intersection crying, because not only did this happen the night before one of the most important days of my life this happend during the roughest week of my life as my mom was just diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis) 2 days prior. And I needed her the most that week. So I did my skills competition trying to hide away how I was feeling because I was partnerd up with my best friend who I kept my relationship from. \nFast forward a couple of months I am still trying to stay in contact with her and somehow being lead on by Sally I decide to take my grad pictures with her my mok and a friend that I consider family as he had been by me and my moms side even before she was diagnosed with MS. Dumb idea tho.\n\nFinally I had enough. Or so I thought, she had drunk called me days after days and it just sucked that she was drinking so much because she always swore to me she would never drink again. And my dumb brain would always pick up. Respond. Always sad on how she dummped me on my ass the way she did. \n\nAfter a day of pondering I finally told her how I was done with how she was stringing me along and making me feel like sh*t and I blocked her on everything besides cell number and Facebook\nI was praying she would text me and prove to me she meant what she told me every time she was drunk.\nAnd when her best friend texted me asking what had happend I told her every single lie she was told by Sally or all the things kept from her cause im a person who hates secrets. And as a cake topping I gave back exaxtly what she gave me. I told my girl best friend a very specific sentence to tell Sally \u201cI know your real name and just how sh*tty you treated my best friend, good luck on your competition\u201d which was my revenge for her destroying my heart before the most important competition for me. I made Sally keep her favourite hoodie of mine and made her keep the bear hoping she would eventually come around\n\nBut now she has this new guy. And it kills me inside because I wish to this day that was me, and maybe im selfish or a jerk or maybe I took things too far with her, but a huge part of me will always want her back. But this new guy just seems like he makes her so much happier. And I stay up untill 3 am most nights just trying to figure out where I went wrong for her to leave \nI was literally the only guy her family liked\u2026\n\nAm I a jerk?",

    "text": "Hello everyone, sorry for the really long post in advance, I will try to skip the introductions and proceed to the real problem. I'm a 28 year old partially disabled man and some months ago I met some people through some video games and start having fun with them really often every day. Some of those people met each other irl and they asked me also to travel and meet them too, I would like to mention they leave in a different city than I am, so I decided to arrange a trip to meet 'em. As i said I'm partially disabled which means I'm using a wheelchair to move around and I also leave alone without my parents or any other person to help me, my everyday life is difficult but not unmanageable. So,  in order to travel I would use the bus and travel(I used this way plenty of times to visit my brother in some other city). So I decide to announce that to my parents some weeks ago that I would travel to some other city and meet some friends, their answer was \"of course and you will go, bravo\", so when the time comes I asked my mom to give me my bank account so I could pay the hotel and the transportation(short story: I was disabled since 5yo so the government gives a small amount of money depending on the percentage of disability and in the last few years that I want to be more independent I asked her to give me my account and the only thing she used to say is \"we don't have time to get you to the bank and fix it\") and she refused saying she can't help me with anything saying I shouldn't travel cause I won't be able to move myself and it's dangerous in general. As a result we start argue and screaming each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day she called me saying we could go together so she could stay one day with me in case I need help and then she'd leave and let me stay alone for the rest of the days, which was a compromise but ok. Today I asked her to use her card to book the hotel(note: I still don't have my account) and she started screaming at me saying she cannot travel and having her own problems. I felt so much angry and choked like someone pushing my chest with heavy stone that I end up break my phone in half, not a big deal but I'm trying to explain how I feel. I'm really sad cause I really want to meet these people, even though they know about my disability they offered to help me with anything I need, and also offered me to go on vacations with 'em(in three months) which is the first time someone asks me something like that and I feel like I'm losing it. I tried to explain my mother that I need some days away from home cause I feel I have burned out my self and the answer was find a job to meet people.\n\nI'm writing this huge post to ask for a way to manage the \"conversation\" between my parents and of course a way to manage my anger.",

    "text": "I count myself lucky to be someone who has never really struggled that hard with depression, but I have had other problems, namely paranoia, delusion, mild dissociative tendencies, off and on parasomnia. This has mostly been the result of childhood trauma that I have overcome a great deal of, at least compared to where I was. \n\nI used to have dissociative episodes where I'd drift away in the middle of something and walk for miles without remembering much of anything, and this happened multiple times a week during the worst of it. It was quite a problem for my attendance when I was in high school. I used to hear voices in my head telling me to kill random people in public; to push them off of ledges or into oncoming traffic, and from a young age I would drink heavily to numb them. I would sit or stand relatively still with no stimulation or sound in darkness for sometimes hours. I thought the government was sending people after me to kill me in my sleep. I am glad to say that I have recovered from this state almost entirely, but I am not perfect.\n\nI no longer hear any voices nor do I completely dissociate. I feel confident that I am able to hold a conversation and even make friends, and at least do most things in my life, even if I don't \"have it together\" so to speak. I don't drink as often as I used to. I credit some of this to therapy, some to doing things on my own like exercising or learning musical instruments, and absolutely none to prescribed medication. I get that it works for some people but it only made things worse for me.\n\nAs mentioned, I am pretty good managing myself these days, but I notice that my mental health mainly suffers during the spring season, and it has for years even before the pandemic. I don't know if maybe I have some seasonal affective thing but for spring (most people hate winter, but I love it). It's nothing I don't feel like I can manage, but I have been getting a bit more erratic lately, drinking a bit, having random horrific thoughts, and experiencing some disruptive EHS during sleep hours (exploding head syndrome, it sounds worse than it is). I think I really hate the spring season and I don't know why. I know there are plenty of these things I can just tidy up for myself, but I am under the impression that having these sort of waves of mental health issues that come and go but aren't detrimental is just a part of adult life.\n\nIf you have any advice, feel free to share, but I think these are just things I may experience from time to time or seasonally. I'm okay with that, I feel good about my direction in life, and I'm doing way better than I was, but I just need to get it off my chest that this is a thing for me that I don't much speak on aside from a couple close friends and therapists.",

    "text": "Since age 12, I have always had someone in my life whom I would consider a serious love interest. Due to lack of freedom, lack of social skills and being brought up in an orthodox family, all my love interests have been unrequited. I have had about 6 different women for whom I had these intense feelings and I got fixated on them for years at a time, always keeping them in mind in the background. It often got to a point where I got overly emotional and could start crying randomly or feel elated fantasizing about all the possibilities if things went my way. I always thought that these women were perfect but I couldn't be with them and it made sense to have these intense emotions.  \n\n\n**The realization** was that I yearned for an emotional connection all this while but was not ready to take on a serious relationship and deal with the reality of it. I was supercharged with emotions often and I directed these emotions to any woman who came in my way and put her on a pedestal, worshipped her in my mind and sulked in despair. But it was never about them, it was always me who created these images of perfect women whom I desire. Just realizing this has given me a great release and I feel free now from all the past emotions, where I had a sense of regret. I do not feel vulnerable anymore to such episodes in future, because I can see that it will most likely be me who is creating it and I am in control to let it go and come back to reality. I feel motivated to pursue a real relationship where there could be a possibility of failure but it could be worthwhile anyways because it would be more real and fruitful than a fake one, an unrequited one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What helped**\n\n* Expressing these emotions when I was younger, whenever I got an opportunity. It helped me get past the obsession temporarily.\n* Reading/listening content that challenged my way of thinking. For me, it has been 'The School of Life' YouTube channel and speeches given by Osho Rajneesh.\n* Seeking therapy when things got out of hand. I have had 5 sessions in the last few months and it has been a life changing experience. The key point here was that I was ready to speak about myself and did not want to hold anything back.\n* Self analysis when possible, especially tracing beliefs and personality traits to past experiences.",

    "text": "This is a stupid post\nI just typed this huge vent out in mentalhealth but half of it got deleted like it always does but i guess it feels kind of better having typed it. But this is like the third time i\u2019ve rejected my support system when all my feelings pile up and just typed a bunch of shit into reddit and deleted it later instead of fucking doing anything about it. As I type these i fantasize about my friends reading them and finally understanding me without the vulnerability of telling them. I don\u2019t like to vent to people. I never did. My dad always yelled at my if I got upset about something. My old best friend dumped all their mental illness on me every day when I was young. Venting to someone just makes me physically uncomfortable and very guilty I feel like a huge burden and i cannot physically bring myself to form the words to explain how i feel. And now, no one knows the actual life I have been living or how I have been feeling  for like a year now. Now the idea of venting comes with the stress that I would have to catch them up on who I actually am instead of the surface level version of myself I act like because it\u2019s easy and i\u2019m a coward. And the guilt that I did not let them see the real me. I had a therapist for like half a month. (Insurance issues.) They told me not to feel bad for not venting, and that I don\u2019t have to tell anyone anything I dont want to. But, no one understands me anymore and I feel so alone because I do not tell anyone anything. I also feel like it\u2019s my fault I\u2019ve ruined my relationship with my best friend. It\u2019s not even actually bad I just feel like i\u2019ve driven us apart. I am so scared of losing him or him not caring about me or understanding me anymore that I just stopped expressing how much I care about him or any of my feelings anymore because I\u2019m a coward and i don\u2019t want to lose him. And i feel like if i showed how much I care about him he would A. not care the same and i would be devastated and/or B. act uninterested/weirded out/annoyed even if he does feel the same. He does this sometimes with affection and it makes me so conflicted and sad but I don\u2019t want to say anything because if he confirms he doesn\u2019t care, i would be truly alone again. And i can\u2019t handle it. I cant handle not being close to him but Incant handle being close to him. I feel so guilty and it is all my fault that we are growing apart from each other. I am so conflicted about him and I hate the space he takes up in my head bc it makes me feel codepdenent and obsessive. I don\u2019t know if i\u2019m in love with him or not. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a good person or not. He makes me feel bad sometimes. He\u2019s very prone to making snide or judgy comments about anything about me that is weird to him. Or about anything that is normal to him but not to me. I feel so rejected for not having the same life as most people. I feel so ashamed. But I know he likes me or he used to.. i dont like myself enough to be confident he likes me anymore. He\u2019s the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. He\u2019s such an awesome person and I love him. We get along so well. He actually cares. But he also cares about anyone.He used to understand me more than anyone ever had but I ruined it by being this way. He would hate me for not having the balls to communicate before if I told him any of this. It\u2019s a ticking time bomb and its all my fault. All i want is to be able to explain how i feel about him to him as soon as possible before it\u2019s too late. All I crave these days is vulnerability. When everything gets too much I write one of these posts on reddit, some commenter gives me advice, and I delete it later, but the entire time I fantasize about my friends reading the post and knowing the things I wrote about me without me having to be vulnerable and tell them. I fantasize every day about horrible things happening to me giving me an excuse to sob in my best friends arms. But every time we hang out I\u2019m too happy to see him again to be sad about anything so I have never gotten that release. I\u2019ve been fantasizing about sobbing in his arms for over a year now. \n.\nHow do you guys vent to people? How do I start venting? How do you think I can save my friendship? Please I am at my wits end and this is just the iceberg of everything that makes me feel so awful about myself right now. I have to get it out to someone",

    "text": "**Backstory (turned rant)**\n\nSo basically up until last year, I hadnt seen my dad in a year, my sister would go up to his house and i wouldnt mostly because my parents arguing and constantly using me as either a punishment against eachother or a reason to argue again and my mother would tell me all this awful stuff about my dad. I eventually retreated into myself in my 5th year of secondary school and stop leaving my bed. I basically fell into a deep depression lol. So anyway thats why i barely went to my dads. The reason why this changed is because my brother died and I had no other option for the funeral. (i am happy i went btw im not a complete monster) The day my brother died my dad came to my home to bring us to the hospital they were keeping him, he basically had a meltdown in my doorway which is understandable. So i went with him and we had the funeral. A couple days after this on our way to the airport to pick up a relative I basically spilled a bunch of stuff that messed me up when I was a kid including my mother trying to end her life in front of me multiple times. He called himself a bad father and me being the people pleaser i am had to make sure he didnt feel that way. He then confessed that the only reason he left me with my mom is that he knew that we were the only things keeping her alive, i felt betrayed and i still feel guilty over the fact i felt betrayed. *It was a good reason wasnt it? I would have felt worse if I knew my mother had killed herself because of me. But when he told me that he chose to leave me in an enviroment where he knew that my mothers mental health was degrading and that he had the ability to take me away from there, he didn't. Even when I stopped going to school. When my mother went into two medically induced comas he would take us for the weekend and leave us at home alone all week. When she was in hospital for months on end we were left alone in the house. Given just enough money to eat. Watching each overdue notice pile. He didnt take us when he saw how i didnt even want to get out of bed. When he saw our once pristine home start to look like an abandoned building and watched me become a shell of the girl i was. I understand he had 4 kids but what about me. What about his first born child. Why didn't i matter. I know Im not a pretty as his other kids but i just. I dont know. I didnt even know he adopted my step sister.* I sometimes feel like the only reason he started making an effort with me was because i let myself slip and rant to him so he saw an opening to make my mom seem like a bad person, well a worse one.\n\n**To the problem i originally came for** \n\nI have recently noticed how much power ive allowed my dad the past year. I switched the school I wanted to go to so it would be closer to his house to I would have to stay with him 5 days a week. I used to say nothing about my mother to anyone and now i feel like he is goading me to talk badly about her. I do of course so it isnt like im guilt free. He will start off a convo with how are you, how is your health, how is your moms health, I dont know why i feel compelled to spill all the time i am pretty sure that its because he is the first to apologise to me. He will start talking about how naive my mom is. If I dont have anything to say about her he will talk about me, god i hate when he brings me up, he will talk about how skilled i am at lying as if he wasnt the one to force me to become some sort of master manipulator. I feel forced to speak and spill to him even though he hasn't said anything to force me. I feel like i am slowly becoming trapped and i didnt realise until it was too late. I feel myself regressing to that little girl desperate to make her parents love her so they wouldnt leave. God i cant even criticise his awful parenting because i feel obligated to defend him. I'm spiraling and i dont know what to do. Sometimes if i tell him im insecure about my body he will tell me \"im not as fat as the other people i see walking down the street\" then he will turn around and say im fatter than his wife. My head is so scrambled, i cant make sense of anything anymore sometimes i feel like im not even existing. Like im going through my day with my conciousness in space just floating, i second guess myself constantly like am i just faking it it? if i am who am i faking it for? Am i just saying this to make myself seem like a better person? Am i saying im faking it to make it seem like i have imposter syndrome? Time feels like its going so fast but I dont remember it at all. \n\nI fake so much confidence. Everyone thinks i'm okay, or maybe not lol. I make a lot of suicide jokes. Are they even jokes at that point? I know i'll never do it im scared that whatever comes after will be worse. Or worse that there will be nothing. That it wont even get better it will just be. To be honest I dont think i am even asking for help. There is nothing you can do. Nothing you can say. no amount of validation will make be feel better, no amount of criticism will make me change my thought process. I guess im just talking to talk so i maybe dont spill to my dad again. God I am so tired. My shoulders and knees feel heavy. why did no teacher notice. Why did the social workers give up so fast. We were 13 and 12 so maybe they thought they should just stop? Why can i not form proper friendships. Why do i have a different persona for everyone i meet. Why do i keep self-diagnosing, How the fuck can I be a psychologist when I CANT EVEN FUCKING FIX MYSELF.  i am so fucking exhausted. Im crying even though i feel so fucking numb. Why am I such a screw up? Why am i such an outcast. Why am i so scared of a god i am so desperate to believe doesnt exist? Because what fucking god would be this cruel to design this shitty of a life for me. I can't even feel fucking bad anymore because i havent been beaten since i was like 9 or 10. I dont feel safe anywhere. I cant even get a fucking job to go to college next year if i even get in. \n\nI dont want to die, i just want to disappear and exist somewhere where I can be who i want to be. Where the tight heavy feeling in my chest wont follow me again. Where I stop writing and deleting stupid reddit posts everytime i feel sleep deprived and sorry for myself. Where I can just be. \n\nI dont even know what this post was supposed to be. A cry for help? A rant? fuck knows, \n\nnow im just lying here. great, what was all this for? Was i trying to make you all feel sorry for me? Are you even real. I feel like my life is a movie and people are always watching. I feel so many eyes. I hope theyre enjoying the show at least, its not getting any better, \n\nIve lost momentum so im going to stop here, This is more of a diary entry than anything else. I hope you enjoy it maybe it will bring some of you some sick sense of enjoyment. Maybe I have given some of you a reason to hate me and be angry. Perhaps the social justice warriors are about to validate my feelings with some random inspirational shit they found on discord. \n\nI dont care. Actually maybe i do i made an entire fucking encyclopedia, ignore all the spelling mistake i give very little shits at the moment. This is the last time i drink a Kong Strong smh energy drinks make me depressive. Thats a lie by the way im pretty sure energy crash is my very own form of self harm. Anyway i feel like if you read to the end of this you deserve at least a goodbye....\n\ngoodbye",

    "text": "***Idk if this is the right subreddit to ask. If it isn't, I'm sorry. I will take this post down immediately. ***\n\nI'm a clueless college student residing in the United States (specifically Florida) and didn't know where to post. For the past 1-2 years, I've had a complete decrease in energy. I sleep all day and still have no energy, despite this. I've stopped doing multiple extracurriculars and hanging out with friends because I just don't feel like leaving my bed anymore. I even skip most of my classes now. I have no focus on schoolwork and no motivation to do anything anymore. I've even considered suicide more often than I'd like to admit. I've skipped multiple assignments due to the lack of drive to do so. I like learning, but I can't seem to focus on ny assignments anymore, and my grades have suffered because of so. On top of this, a goal of mine is to go to medical school in the future, so these bad grades are harming me a lot.\n\nI've had therapy in the past, but it got cut short due to financial reasons- my school gives free sessions to those enrolled on courses, but I had to stop during summer or pay for the sessions. I am broke and couldn't afford the money to pay. I was also too afraid to use insurance, as I'm on my parents insurance plan (who are anti-therapy).\n\nAfter 2 years, I want to 100% tackle this issue head on. I am willing to bite the bullet and pay to see a psychiatrist, even if that means I'm skipping meals to do so. I'm so upset that I let it get this bad in the first place. I want to talk to a psychiatrist to see what's up, as my previous therapist alluded to me having possible major depressive disorder. The thing is, idk where to start to look for one. Idk the process of using health insurance and how it works. Where would I learn how to do this? I started researching local psychiatrists online but idk how I would get in contact with them without sounding weird. \n\nI know this is weird to ask, but I would love advice on how I would approach this. I appreciate it in advance!",

I want to change.\n\nMy problems:\n-Hyperfixations, like I think about team Fortress 2 99% of the time (though I certainly wouldn't mind if I had a friend to talk about it's lore with)\n\n-I bring up irrelevant topics or personal stories, like we'll be talking about, idk, crayfish? And I just randomly say an anecdote about dolphins nobody cares about.\n\n-laugh too loudly\n\n-involuntary noises\n\n-talk to much, talk too little\n\n-lack of empathy. No, I'm not a sociopath, but it's hard for me to connect to people even if they're suffering sometimes. I know it's bad to be a bystander so I try to help, but I think more logically than emotionally sometimes and don't know what to do. I want to feel empathy better, it's just a little broken.\n\n-constant daydreaming of situations that will never happen.\n\nEdit:. I *don't* want to love my autism, I want to be different. If you have nothing to say other than I shouldn't suppress myself, please help someone else. Literally nothing you can say will make me want to be autistic.\n\nMore reasons:\n\n-People look down on me and see me as a child. I can't possibly have a relationship if people see me as autistic. I hate the whole \"omg so wholesome because you're autistic!!!\" bs too. Sometimes I don't feel like an adult, I still feel like a kid. I'm scared I can't grow up, or my brain will be forever lower than everyone else's, or ill never be able to comprehend the world out there. \n\n-I can't read people sometimes. I'll be having a joke argument with a friend and suddenly he tells me he isn't joking. A friend will have sad body language and I'll playfully hit them, they yell at me.\n\n-social cues. I look back on my actions as a kid, teen, and even few weeks ago where I think \"Why did I do that?\" I hate it, it's embarrassing. I hate when people excuse my awkwardness because I'm autistic. \n\nI've been hiding I'm on the spectrum to new people I meet on and offline.",

    "text": "I\u2019m actually struggling to write this. I\u2019ve never actually written out my thoughts like this.\n\nI\u2019m a 19 year old male. I\u2019ve always considered my self thick skinned and borderline robotic when it comes to emotions. Also as a male I feel like I don\u2019t really have/know how to talk about my mental health with my friends and family. I love my best friends, I honestly do but out of the 3 of us I\u2019m definitely the most closed off and private and don\u2019t really know how to open up. With my family I just don\u2019t have the type of relationship to talk about anything real with my mother and my father is a piece of shit\u2026 it feels good writing that out.\n\nWith the pandemic I\u2019ve basically been alone with my thoughts, they\u2019ve got dark but never to a point where I\u2019d ever even consider acting on them.\n\nLately however, in this  last week even, I feel as if I\u2019m the most unlucky person on the planet. Almost as if there is a \u201cGod\u201d up there, that he has a personal vendetta against me. Every decision I make seems to go wrong.\n\nFor example as a life long lover of sports, I\u2019ve recently taken up sports betting. Now I\u2019d like to preface this with I am not addicted. Ive been doing it for a while with friends for fun as it does add another element of excitement to sports. However I feel no matter what I do I lose and my friends win, if we bet together we both lose. I do my research, analyze trends take a consensus smart pick backed by  analytical data and still find my self losing.\n\nNow the betting isn\u2019t the reason I\u2019m sad but it\u2019s the thing that has pushed me over into a state of WTF why does \u201cGod\u201d or the Universe or whatever hate me. Why don\u2019t any of my choices pan out, why don\u2019t I get any luck. Why were all my friends born much for well off. Why were all my other friends born and raised with a loving and supportive mom and dad whilst I was born with an amazing single mom but an mentally and physically abusive dad. Why when I hang out with my friends/extended friends we all seem to have a good time however I\u2019m always the one that gets left out on 90% of the outings. \n\nI\u2019ve always been a no quit, roll with the punches kinda guy. But punches fucking hurts and u can only take so many of them and I think it\u2019s now starting to really hit me. I\u2019m just worried  that all the pain, anger sadness I\u2019ve suppressed and pushed away for 19 years will just flow out and I\u2019m not going to be able to stop. When I truly think of myself the only word that comes to mind is useless. A word that I vividly remember my father calling me while I was in the back seat of his car all because I played a bad game of hockey when I was 12. \n\nI know this is long so thanks if you read all of it. I kinda just rambled on so idk if this flows or is even grammatically correct. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m asking for tbh. Maybe I just needed to get this out. Maybe I just need to be herd. I know there are billions of people worse off than me and my heart goes out to them. Hell I even feel guilty that I\u2019m sad because with so many people in a worse position why the fuck should I be sad. \n\nI think I just need someone to honestly tell me if it gets better or am I just fucked for life",

But then at stage 3, which I've only ever reached once, I become extremelly calm looking and like nearly like if I was in a trance, let me explain\n\nSo it was when I was locked up by the child protection services and I had a roomate, he was mad at me so he let dropped my phone screen first on the ground, and that was the thing that took me to calm directly yo my last stage of anger, and the only time I got there, I slowly got up, furious inside yet extremelly calm and still thinking rationally, went to take my metal water bottle, slowly went to empty the water, as to not hurt him too badly, didn't wanted to get sued, and proceeded to trow it at his face, while still remaining calm.

    "text": "My husband voluntarily committed himself to a mental health hospital on Sunday, and it is now Tuesday.  \\*TRIGGER WARNING: S\\*ICIDAL THOUGHTS\\* When we made this decision together, it was because he has found himself stuck in a depressive rut between his job, family, and own identity, and even went as far as saying he would have ended his life if he didn't love me and the life we have created together. \\*END WARNING\\* My husband and I are both queer and he struggles most with his sexuality and gender identity because of familial trauma that makes him feel like lesser of a person because of it, so this is not directly tied to our marriage. I know that he does love me even though I am a woman and would love to not have any advice suggesting he is using me as a cover-up. He also throws himself too harshly into toxic friendships, a bad work environment, and has struggled with a dependency on weed to help him sleep. He wants to get better, learn to love himself, and I want the best for him, so we agreed that in-patient treatment would be the best option. Even if all he does is take this time as a hard reset and a vacation.\n\nThe only place in our area he can go is one that has some flaws with it. One thing I don't like much is that they're vague about when he will be released, which I know isn't really their fault since they don't know him or his problems yet. They told me he might be in for as short as 72 hours or as long as 10-14 days... and they haven't called me with any updates yet like they promised they would. This hospital has... interesting reviews and I can't help but find myself up the walls anxious about how he's doing. I wish I could be a fly on the wall of that place and make sure nobody is giving him bad advice about himself or medicine that makes him feel sick or worse. I don't want anyone traumatizing him and convincing him to not follow through with more help in the future. (He's also not allowed to be visited by me or call me while he's away, which I understand, but makes me so nervous. What if he needs my help to get out and can't tell me??)\n\nI've also started having anxious thoughts that he is going to come back as someone I don't know, or someone that doesn't love me anymore. I want him to be happy so badly but I don't want to lose the love of my life just for the sake of him being better. I want us to be okay together and work towards bettering his life as a team.\n\nThis is probably important to note, but I have diagnosed OCD and anxiety, but I am medicated, while my husband never has been on medicine. Any advice for how to calm myself down, or stories from people who have had similar experiences would be helpful. I just want to feel grounded and in-control right now. And, above all, I miss my best friend more than anything.",

He is a great father, and has worked his ass off to provide for our family. But, he has a lot of physical health issues that have resulted in severe depression and anxiety.\n\nI try to show him that I am here for him and care for him often, but almost every positive/encouraging talk we have is dismissed by him saying things like, \"I know I'm worthless, and you will be better off when I'm gone.\" No matter how much I try to encourage and reassure him, he is always self-loathing. He has said many times that he doesn't care about himself, and wants to die. It hurts me to hear those things, because he has been saying stuff like that since I was young. I didn't know how to help him then, and I don't know now.\n\nI think overall he feels unappreciated by my mom and me and my sister. But he refuses to communicate his needs, and instead assumes that we know when he needs or wants something. When the unspoken need is not met, he then will say that we don't care about him. Example: he has often said that he wanted daughters because he saw how his sister would wait on and cater to his father. He's said that he has hoped and prayed that we would do the sane, but to him we haven't done that. \n\nWe try our best to keep him happy and give him what he needs and wants, but it seems like he us so deep in self-loathing that he is projecting those feelings onto us. It makes me feel guilty and that I am a bad daughter for not being able to help him.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?",

Just writing my mind.\n\nHonestly, just TDLR: What's a healthy balance of music for an ADD mind with trouble processing life and mild depression? Thanks. \n\nI suffer from sever inattentive Type ADHD, I struggle with keeping attention, focusing, and remembering things such as multi-step directions. I struggled with school really hard but only recently was diagnosed. I'm in 20's now. \n\nI'm an incapable and immature adult (I feel like I have the maturity of a 12-14 year old, my 15 year old sister is WAY more mature and motivated with life), live with my mother, can't drive because I can't keep attention, afraid I'll die. No job. I'm absolute wreck. I've been getting counseling and working through, making a little progress here and there, SLOWLY..\n\nMy struggles with ADHD have lead to many years of insecurities, self doubt, low motivation, low confidence in myself, ECT. I can't do anything and struggle getting started. I have known my life was a wreck but didn't know why or how to fix it. I thought I was mentally retarded. Well finally, last year my Mother showed a video about ADD which was so me! I got diagnosed last summer/fall and eventually found medicine that helps me to think clearer and deeper, and even more recently stuff my anxiety/depression.\n\nOkay wow, I didn't plan on writing all of that.\n\nI only wanted to know what a healthy balance of music is for mental health. Music helps keep me anchored in the moment and eases my overthinking. It makes me happy, motivated, okay with the world, (and sometimes forget about it altogether which can be nice great, *sometimes). I know someone who had a reliance on video games where he used them like a crutch, he had had to have them and would go kind of hide from the world. I've been afraid of being reliant on anything like him. My mother said today that my constant brain input from either my phone (I know this one is bad, we've been working on it) or music may be a part of my ADHD related inabilities and now I'm curious. I don't play it every loud and am usually a few from the speaker. I don't play it while going to sleep, nor all day. But it is usually in for a good portion, maybe a third of the day. \n\nSorry for the mess.",

    "text": "I can\u2019t seem to live my day to day life anymore it\u2019s just an overwhelming feeling of doom and built up tension. I\u2019ve stayed cooped up in my house since early/mid February pretty much and am having a hard time staying motivated or even wanting to go out and hang with my friends. My ex dumped me a couple days after New Years and since then, I\u2019ve gone out three times. \n\nFebruary 11th I went to a Valentines theme club type of thing and ended up seeing him a lot throughout that night. I had a feeling I might see him there since he goes out multiple times a week but what I didn\u2019t expect was my body\u2019s reaction. It\u2019s like I was spiraling and couldn\u2019t breath or see straight. Long story short, I saw him holding hands with a friend of his who he told me to never worry about and it completely broke me. There\u2019s a lot more background to it and reasoning on why I was so upset seeing this but It\u2019s a lot to dive deep into and not really pertinent. Most definitely one of the worst nights of my life and things escalated quickly.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had the worst fear of going out in town again. Even driving to the store or doing things in broad  daylight give me the worst anxiety and impending dread. Throughout the last month I thought I was doing better and could handle going out to dinner with a couple of my friends even though the restaurant is in a prime spot for bar hopping on a Saturday night. Regardless, I went in hopes of having a good night with my girlfriends. Although I didn\u2019t see him, that same feeling came back and stronger than ever. I was in my head the whole time scared to run into him or his friends again. It first starts with my heart racing and feeling like I have shortness of breath. My hands start to shake uncontrollably and I\u2019m aware that people can see that so I usually sit on them to hide it but in return it makes my legs shake. When I focus my attention on trying to stop my legs from shaking it then moves to my whole body shaking like my shoulders and jaw. If I try to stop the shaking in one spot it just finds another to release this build up tension. My vision goes blurry and I feel the need to run away from anyone/everyone. I feel like I can\u2019t tell anyone about these side effects I\u2019ve been having. Not that my friends would judge me, I just feel stupid. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been having anxiety attacks or panic attacks but it\u2019s stunting my life. I\u2019ve always had anxiety but each day it\u2019s building and building. I rarely see daylight and dread running into my ex again or anyone else other than my tight circle. I simply just don\u2019t want to see anyone anymore. I guess my question is how do you overcome this anxiety and has anyone been through a similar situation?",

    "text": "Hey all. \n\nThe past 2ish months have been absolute hell with work. 10 hour days, working weekends (I'm a consultant/ software dev).  I see a company- sponsored therapist remotely twice a month because I noticed i started to feel depressed, or symptoms of depression. She and I worked on things like mindfulness and the importance of mental transitions between work and leisure. I was down, slightly irritable, but most of time, I was managing. Usually a day off would reset me.\n\nThis month things at work have ramped up significantly. More projects put on my plate, more people to manage (I was promoted to a senior position). I work on 7 client projects concurrently in different windows on my PC...I started to just get angry, all the time. I started to have no patience for anyone, they all need to do things faster. When I'm doing non-work things like cooking, it becomes work of \"how do I make this as efficient as possible\" or \"why does my dog take so long to pee\". I no longer have time to eat lunch, I swallow food whole In between meetings because I'm in back to backs. I need my work to be perfect. My father calls my brothers and I and tells us he's having trouble with my mom. Can't focus on that now, not enough brain capacity. \n\nI don't abuse alcohol, but some nights I have to use it to quiet my brain from being overclocked for ten hours straight. I have panic attacks where I feel like I can't breathe. \n\nI have trouble sleeping. I feel like I'm going through a fog. I am losing interest in things. My wife says she feels like we're having issues because of it. I sometimes have thoughts of hurting myself - not suicide. My wife now knows this. She is amazingly supportive.\n\nThis morning I was on my couch, eating breakfast before logging in to work. My cat comes on my lap and headbutts my bowl. I fucking lose it (not at him), I clench my entire body so hard I pull muscles in my neck and arms. I then just start crying and screaming. I bury my face in the couch and just make strained sounds. I don't recognize this person anymore. This persists for several minutes until I call my therapist. She tells me to call out of work for a few days. I do.  I no longer care about what people might think. \n\nI'm going to increase the frequency of my therapy. Maybe seek a doctor. Clearly something is going on here. My impression is this is what was formerly known as a \"nervous breakdown\", right?",

He went from having a slight cough to needing to be on a ventilator in less then 24 hours. On October 30th he passed away. I never got to say goodbye or hold his hand. I wasnt allowed to see him before he died. I've been holding together emotionally by self medicating. I even posted myself nude for no other reason but to recieve comments to help my self esteem. \n\nIt was a terrible self management ritual but it worked for the past few months. But last week I was informed that the company I work for is getting rid of all office staff at my job and my position in the company would cease to exist immediately. I was escorted along with 16 other employees into our office to get our personal items. They even hired an off duty officer to search our boxes and bags to be sure we didnt take anything from the company. \n\nI came home and began self medicating. It wasnt bad at first but I pushed it beyond limits with wine and other things. I cant say I consciously want to commit suicide but I definitely didnt want to live anymore. Around 3am the police knocked at my door because I was playing my music very loudly.\n\nI was fortunate to find one of the responding officers was a friend of my husband James. He knew immediately that I wasnt ok. He asked what I had consumed and I started crying. I didnt want to tell him but I did. He and his partner convinced me to let them help me. I went with them to a hospital and got the help I needed. I was let out and am now getting outpatient help and have a counselor on speed dial. \n\nI'm in an acceptable place for all I've been going through. I have no desire to drink and I've had no trouble sleeping. I trust the doctors taking care of me and feel that I'm on a good path towards getting well.\n\nI just really needed a safe place where I can discuss feelings without being attacked or bullied.

So Rain and I have been friends since we were 9 we are neighbors and we did have a few fights and we weren\u2019t friends for about 3 years. And I\u2019m 16 now and we became friends again at the age of 14 but when we were 15 she became really clingy, and she had fight with a lot of her friends and most of them dropped her, she vented to me about it almost everyday for about 6 months, asking me what she should do, and when I say no. She would pressure me into giving her advice like\n\n\u201cOh if you were me what would you do? Come on! Think about it\u201d. Imma be honest, I gave up on giving her advice after 4 months. She only has about 6 main friends now, and so do I.

I find it annoying because if I don\u2019t answer the first few calls she will keep calling until I answer. Especially since she lives next to me, I feel like I have to hide in my own home because I feel so mentally drained and I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to her about it before I even suggested for her to talk to another friend about it.

Stop being so selfish.\u201d\n\nAnd I told her to stop calling me so much, and she treats it as a joke.\n\nImma be honest she treats my feelings as a joke too.

Im so tired of this I just want this to stop. She has called me about 48 times in a span of 4 days. 12 times a day.\n\nAt first I thought she was a clingy person but now I just don\u2019t know how to feel about this.

I always had mild anxiety that was however easily managed. Like, per say, for school activities, talking to strangers, making friends, phone calls... Those were usually handled pretty well. However, when I started secondary school (High school, whatever...) I started being (very likely) depressed but have never been diagnosed. Eventually, I was able to drop out at my late 15.\n\n Now, when I turned 17 I felt like I should start working. This is when shit started spiraling out of control. I had no problem on interviews, I would easily get the job, but when I did my first day, I'd feel a panic attack coming, and had this urge to flee that I couldn't resist. So I always ended up making up an excuse and leaving then calling later and say it won't work out and I was quitting. I then started taking antidepressants since then. I am now 20 years old, will be turning 21 this year, and I still cannot work. I am a very happy confident person, but I have a severe fear of work that I CANNOT fight through. I have never been able to push through the first day.\n\n That in itself is an issue, but it's not why I am making this post. I am writing this to ask for advice about antidepressants.\n\n I feel like a blissful shell of the person I used to be. Yes, I am overall happier, but it feels fake. I'm not happy because my life is great, I'm happy because I have chemicals being pumped into my brain daily. I used to be a quiet, introverted person who was kind yet reserved. Now I feel like an obnoxious over excited extravert. I hate how... euphoric I've become.\n\n I wish I could just handle and tame my anxiety without a drug distorting my personality. I feel inauthentic. I feel numbed to any emotions that aren't bliss or joy. I used to be a big crier, and that's something I loved about myself. I loved that I was never afraid to be vulnerable and show feelings. I also have severe side effects that force me to rotate my medication constantly. Light-headedness, feeling fainty, not remembering shit, being very unmotivated, I have no passion, lower libido...\n\n Where is Paul? Where is the real me? What kind of imposter am I? I wanna find myself again. But I have gone off anti depressants before, and It was a shit show. I also can't really get off them until I find a job, right? I feel lost. Please someone guide me.\n\nTLDR: I have high anxiety and feel unlike myself because of medication.",

Things seem less colourful, I feel cut off from reality to an extent and nothing feels right. \n\nBut the other day I went to a party (I don't often go to parties) and I'd only had one drink. I remember sitting at a table watching people dance, feeling like I couldn't join. Next thing I remember was leaving the party.\n\nA friend of mine later told me she found me sitting on the floor, against a wall crying my eyes out and saying \"nobody wants me\". She took me to the bathroom to help me sort myself out, but I don't remember any of this. I have no memory of this moment of time whatsoever, I don't know whether it was half an hour or an hour that I missed, but I feel so embarrassed. \n\nIt's the first time in my life someone has told me I did something that I didn't remember doing.\n\nDoes this sound like a dissociative episode?\n\nAnd if it does, what can I do? Any advice/opinions/support would be really welcomed as I've been a bit freaked out since and anxious about the situation.",

Again there are many more details but it hurt. A lot. This happened in July or so. But I've shed way too many tears to continue living like this. But I am 14. I can't get help on my own. That's where the problem is. Since my depression's origins are rooted in my old friend and drugs, I can't tell my parents that. But I have to tell my parents *something* if I want to get a therapist, antidepressants, etc. So I'm kind of stuck here. Should I tell my parents?

    "text": "I\u2019m not sure where to start. I know this subreddit is full of people who need more help then me. I just need to write my thoughts down and collect them. \n\nFirst off my main problem is gender dysphoria. Not many people know what it is, or maybe they just don\u2019t care enough to learn. I have been struggling with it for 2 years. I\u2019m 14 right now and things have gotten, way worse. In fact I think the main root of my problem lies here. 2 years ago a good 6 months after I learned what gender dysphoria is and realized I probably had it, I began to come out to my close online friends. They where really supportive and that gave me confidence to come out to more people. Later that summer, I tried to tell my mom, but my 12 year old self couldn\u2019t explain it right. She completely shut me down and said that I wasn\u2019t thinking right and that there is no way I could be feeling that way.\n\nThat one experience rattled me to my core.\nMy mom appeared to forget about it and I closed myself off after that. But it didn\u2019t help. I just began to feel all these emotions but I was to scared or nervous to talk about them or let them out. A year later when I was feeling more confident that I could reach my family with my problems. But at that same time I lost my grandma to cancer. But that\u2019s not all. My surviving grandfather moved back to his home town in Texas without even saying his goodbyes. Just so he could get with his dead wife\u2019s sister and blame everything on me, my sister, and my parents. He kept harassing us about it so we just cut him out of our life. But it took me a while to fully recover. I felt if I came out with my problems my family would shut me out again. Tell me to stop making more problems. \nHaving gone through a lot. people started judging how I was acting at school. Now I have always been the \u201cshy type\u201d and I was an introvert and kind of anti social when it came to face to face interaction. I would always have nervous breakdowns talking to new people and I always felt people thought I was weird and disgusting. People started making fun of how I would randomly start crying in class after all that happened with my grandma. It became sort of a running joke through the 6th grade as people starting making up things that I was crying about. Of course this didn\u2019t help my my social problems they just kept building. \n\nBut soon as the schools closed due to covid, I felt better. I didn\u2019t need to worry about kids at school and I was building back my confidence. I was still too nervous to come out so I just held everything that came with it inside. The next year we had a choice. Stay at home to learn or go-in person. I begged my parents to let me stay home. They asked why I couldn\u2019t be a normal kid and go in person. When I told my mom it was because of types of people at school, she agreed. She wasn\u2019t happy about it, she told me \u201cyou can\u2019t hide from those kids forever, one day you have to face it and be a normal boy.\u201d \n\nEven though I knew I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the kids for a year. I never felt any better. I went through the whole year without ever letting my feeling spill out. I didn\u2019t want to burden my family with useless personal issues. I kept feeling like there was something off because the longer I kept in my feelings the sadder I felt, and the more effort I had to put in just to hide my feelings. \n\nMy mom must have noticed something was wrong because she kept reminding me that she is there to talk to if I ever need her. \nBut I took her words with a grain of salt as she did quite the opposite when I tried. \n\nAnother year passed and I had to go back to school. I tried to stay hidden and not talk to people to prevent me having a panic attack. At this point I was really pushing to make my friends and family think I\u2019m fine. \n\nI\u2019m going into the last stretch of 8th grade and going into high school. But at this point I can\u2019t keep all my emotions in. I just want this nightmare to end. I don\u2019t want to be afraid to be myself. I recently met a new friend group, full of people I knew would understand me. If I come out to anyone, it\u2019ll be them first. Next year I\u2019m not going to the school district high school. I\u2019m going to a vocational school where nobody knows me. \n\nThankfully this group of friends plans to go there too along with me. I want more than anything to start new there as the person I\u2019m supposed to be. Now that I\u2019m going into high school my parents might take me more seriously. But I have to wait if I want this plan to work. I can\u2019t help thinking about if I had just gone through with my plan and came out ages ago, where I would be today. I understand the longer I wait the worse things get but if I come out during the school year I will be humiliated at school and if my parents don\u2019t take me seriously I will have. A repeat of before.\n\nI can\u2019t hold in my feelings forever. The longer I do the more depressed I feel, the more anxious I get. I have never been diagnosed with theses things. Frankly nobody but me and two other people know about my problems. I\u2019m less here speaking sympathy and more here to bring a message.\n\nFollow your dreams. And try to reach for the stars at every opportunity you get because you never know when the opportunity will a-raise again. Reach for the things in life that will give you happiness. Because without happiness, you have no will to keep living. I hope I did something here today. I hope this want for nothing. And if your going through a similar situation. Know you\u2019re not alone. \n\nI wish you luck",

My sister, who is a psychiatrist (she is not treating my wife, as she is a family member and that would be unethical, she just suggested this personally) said that my wife may benefit from an \"emotional support pet\". My wife was positive about it, and her therapist was too.  The best would likely be getting a pair of bunnies as my wife loves them and used to \"bunny sit\" for her friend's family while in university. There is also an exotic vet near us so we have access  to care. However, I'm on the edge about it as obviously a pet is a commitment and am unsure if it would actually help or if its best to wait until she's better. Or even if it is ok to get a pet for this reason? What do you think, anyone have experience with pets helping you cope with mental health issues?",

    "text": "Hey yall. Bit of a rant here, questions at the end.\n\nMy mental health has been suffering the past few years. I had a stroke of bad luck late 2019 into early 2020. I had a really fucked up relationship with a girl a year older than me (she was very manipulative and sexually assaulted me a few times), I had a really fucked up breakup with said girl, my dog of 12+ years died right before a big move away from my only friend. I did virtual school during my junior year and started to get better. Then, July 2021, my grandma died and my family basically fell apart (more than it already had).\n\nI\u2019m a Senior now going in-person at school which feels like a living hell. I graduate at the end of May, so only a few months left and then I\u2019m going to visit my friend (that I moved away from) and visit my brother and his wife (who had a baby in the fall) each for a week. When I come back, I\u2019m going to pickup my summer job at the nearby lake. I start an EMT course in the fall and if all goes well, I\u2019ll be working with my nearby service by the spring of next year.\n\nNot all is bad at school, honestly. I enjoy my teachers and there\u2019s a girl I have lunch with. I have a crush on her, but I can\u2019t tell if she likes me back or not. We\u2019re friends though, so I just enjoy that I get to spend time with her. I also have this fire rescue program I\u2019m going through and I\u2019ve sort of adopted our Lieutenant as a sort of \u201cDad\u201d away from home.\n\nBut I\u2019m so stressed about everything. At the beginning of the school year, I had these big plans to graduate and go off to this really good uni in my state. Now, I\u2019m just trying to gather enough fucks to turn my assignments in on time. I have good grades but it\u2019s only because I\u2019m busting my ass all the time trying not to fail, because the second my grades start slipping, my parents start pressing me and I start getting things taken away (like videogames/phone/ability to go to work). I tell them I\u2019m exhausted and it feels like I only have time to worry about school work. I tell that I\u2019m so tired and that I don\u2019t even have it in me to care about my grades anymore but they don\u2019t care. They just tell me \u201cat least you have good grades\u201d\u2026. Which, yeah, cool, I have an A in Econ, but like,,,, I don\u2019t feel like a human person, so ???\n\nMy permit was invalidated when we moved and I never got a new one. Now I have to test for a driver\u2019s license. To be an EMT, I need one. My mom always shits all over me (in general, but a lot about my driving) and sometimes even straight up *lies* about my driving, but when I try to defend myself she gets all weird and acts like she thinks I\u2019m the greatest driver in the world. I\u2019m not an outstanding driver, but I managed to drive around on my permit for almost a full year with no issues. So they\u2019re always on me about getting a license. They\u2019re always on me about saving up for a car. I can\u2019t have a car if I don\u2019t have a license, but they insist I should buy a car ASAP. So I start looking at cars and they damn near start mocking me about how I can\u2019t afford a car. So I\u2019m also stressed about that.\n\nI gave up trying to fix my relationship with my mom. She gets upset by everything I do or say, as if everything I do is solely intended to be an attack against her, and somehow makes me seem like the bad guy lying manipulator in every situation, so now I have to basically customer-service voice her all the time just to keep the peace. I thought my relationship with my dad was good, but he\u2019s been really snippy and rude to me lately. My Lt feels like the only healthy \u201cparent\u201d relationship I have and he\u2019s not even my real dad.\n\nI try to express this to my therapist and her only help is to give me a \u201creframe your thinking\u201d sheet and to suggest I go on anti anxiety meds. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t actually listen to me and she just does whatever makes her feel like a Good Therapist.\n\nSo, now, I\u2019m getting more into ***the whys and my questions***;\n\nI\u2019ve had really bad periods lately where I go through a few days of feeling completely unstable and then a week or two of feeling fine. Sometimes it gets so bad that I forget ever being okay and it feels like the world is caving in on itself. I\u2019m so stressed out and I\u2018m making myself feel crazy. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t do anything and I don\u2019t want to eat or drink those days. I\u2019ve had a trash week and ended up throwing about a week clean from SH down the drain.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about asking to be put into a local IOP this summer.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go inpatient, because I can\u2019t take that much time away from work and my parents will make it about them rather than let me get the help I need. But the therapy I have now isn\u2019t good enough. I see her twice a month and it\u2019s a 50/50 if I\u2019m going to leave feeling better or leave feeling like shit.

I\u2019m thing about asking for an antidepressant like Prozac or smthn.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m just curious about peoples\u2019 experiences with IOPs.\n\nIf they find out I\u2019ve SHed, do they have to report it ?\n\nAre they allowed to show my records to my parents (I\u2019m 18) ?\n\nI know some residential programs do a checkup and take photos of any scars / SH at the start, do they do that for IOPs ?\n\nSince I\u2019m 18, I\u2019ll be with the adults and not teens\u2026 if anyone knows, how different is it being with adults vs teens ? Especially as an 18 y/o ?\n\nDid it help at all ?\n\nIs there anything I should be cautious about or consider ?\n\nIf anyone knows, could an IOP fuck up my chances at being an EMT ?\n\nEdit: I live in the US and I\u2019m on my dad\u2019s insurance (Tricare) until I\u2019m 21.",

    "text": "  TLDR: I opened up to someone for the first time ever about some mental health stuff that I have going on. It has opened me up to a wide range of emotions that I have not been prepared to deal with so I have been talking to them. They have repeatedly said that they are there for me and that they want to help me but a childhood experience has made it to where I am afraid that they will leave if I keep bringing it up with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to start this off by saying that my friend did nothing wrong, but after opening up to them my mental health has seemed to get worse. They have been super supportive through it all, but its my brain and a past experience that is the issue. \n\nI have never really opened up to anyone about anything. I have always bottled up my emotions and hid them deep inside me because honestly, I don't really understand them. I have never really built good coping mechanisms because of it. However, recently one of my friends opened up to me and made me feel safe enough to be vulnerable around them. At the time it felt great to be open with someone and let it all out. The issue now is that I am feeling very strong emotions that I have not been equipped to deal with. I feel even worse because my friend has been through way worse stuff than I have. I often find myself on various mental health subreddits and compare myself to the other people positing on there and tell myself that I have not experienced anywhere near the amount of stuff that they have for me to feel the way I do. I worry a lot, most of what I worry about is that when I get close to someone they are going to leave me. When I was a kid there was another kid that lived down the street from me. He was a couple of years older than I was but we got really close and played together almost everyday, sometimes to the point where my mom would tell me to give it a few days before inviting him over again. As we got older, he wanted to hang out with other kids his age and when he would come over he would spend most of the time on his phone and not want to do much with me. I don't blame him for that. There is a lot of maturing in childhood. A couple of years is a lot when you're not even 10 yet. While I don't blame him for wanting to hang out with older kids, I think that watching him continue to come over and be on his phone most of the time made it hard for me to trust that people actually want to be my friend. Ever since he and I stopped hanging out I have always had this worry in the back of my mind that people don't actually want to be around me and that they only hang out with me because they feel obligated to. \n\nHow does this all tie into my post? Well, I opened up to my friend about some stuff and that opened up a whole lot of emotions that I had been hiding from other people as well as myself. It took me to a dark place. I started to talk through it with them more, but I felt bad for having little relational problems, poor self image, and imposter syndrome (all of which I brought on myself) when they had an actually rough life. I find myself apologizing to them almost every day for bringing my small problems to them and recently I have thought about not telling them the stuff that I struggle with because I am afraid that the next time I do they will leave me. On multiple occasions they have told me that they are there for me and that no matter what they are going through they will always be there for me, but there's that voice in the back of my head saying that they are going to leave the next time that I bring something to them. I don't want them to leave but at the same time I don't want to be left alone with the stuff in my head.",

I want it free because I don't have any money to gain a class for example. doing language class such as Spanish would be perfect but I don't have money right now.\n\nand I do have plenty of online friends and they are awesome to be honest, I have a community that is really supportive and they are really good people, but I want to try to have real friends and does that make a difference between real people and online people and should I stick to online friends?\n\nmy second plan is doing exercises, I would like to walk to start with, just walking few blocks away from home, but here is the problem I am facing, the problem is these streets reminds me my whole life here and all the traumas and creepy feelings. every time I walk just little in these streets I want to go back home. so I can't do that and I want suggestions on the subject.\n\nI am not planning to seek for a job as it is highly frustrating here where I live and not only seeking the job is frustrating but even the simplest job here takes me out of my mind and I don't want to do that right now, I have had the experience many times and all the jobs I had are heavily unpleasant experiences. and I can handle even for six months or even a year financially without a job.\n\nand I am planning to go for psychotherapy and it is really cheap and near me, hope they will be available that's it, because last time I checked they weren't. but if they will be available, what should I expect for a therapy? should I expect telling me how I should handle my life? or express my feelings? or it's like telling them everything like journaling and letting them analyze it and let them tell me their insights?\n\nthanks.",

    "text": "I know my friends do not owe me anything. Realistically, they are not responsible for helping me when I struggle. It isn\u2019t their job, it\u2019s mine, but it still hurts when things like this happen.\u00a0\n\nI was staying up late with a small group, and most of the time when this happens we kind of collectively end up discussing our problems. It\u2019s a sort of group-therapy operation. However, the thing about me is, I never discuss a particular aspect of my issues. A couple nights ago, I figured I\u2019d try. In my 17 years, I\u2019ve only mentioned my childhood sexual assault around my siblings, who were also involved. Though it happened so long ago, I\u2019m currently going through the court case that resulted after my brother admitted what happened to all of us during his third trip to the psych ward.\n\nMy friends were aware of the situation, but hadn\u2019t heard my side of the story, just my sisters. It felt so good to talk about it, to let this pent up anger sort of disperse. I never discuss what happened, but deciding to try was actually therapeutic in a way. However, due to the unfamiliar situation, I found myself asking them, \u201cBy the way, let me know if you want me to stop talking about it, I know it\u2019s an ugly subject.\u201d\n\nOne particular person responded. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t care.\u201d I laughed that off, it was just an odd way of wording it, right? But they followed it up with: \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t care. Talk if you want, I guess.\u201d I sort of thought she was joking, but then she noticed my questioning expression and emphasized it even more. \u201cI really just don\u2019t care what you want to say. It\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\n\nRealistically, it was an attempt to comfort me. Everybody, including her, knows that I get extremely uncomfortable around pity. I imagine she tried to act nonchalant because she thought it would be best, but I couldn\u2019t keep trying to mention myself after that. Watching her play on her phone, and just hearing \u2018no, I really don\u2019t care\u2019 on repeat in my mind did quite the job of shutting me up. Discussing that part of myself is such a rare thing for me to do, and to have it brushed off felt very disheartening. I know it isn\u2019t a big deal to her and the others, but it was a big deal for me to finally talk about that.\u00a0\n\nAnd, she\u2019s one of my only friends. As pathetic as it sounds, I\u2019m a very lonely person. I sort of fall into that middle-part of \u201clikable but not loveable\u201d. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m hard to associate with, I\u2019m quite extroverted and like to consider myself fun, but nobody pays me a second mind. I\u2019m an accessory not a necessity, and that\u2019s always sort of weighed on me.\u00a0\n\nWith my tourette\u2019s syndrome, I\u2019ll sometimes have these sorts of full-body fits. They\u2019re decently unpredictable, I can tell when one is about to occur, but it can happen without direct reasoning. I hate it when these happen in front of people, it is awful and frightening and I always end up crying. I don\u2019t want anybody to see me fall apart the way I do when these episodes happen, it is a sure way to make me feel pathetic.\n\nThe night after that conversation, I felt one start around 11pm, and I sobbed into my pillows as my body kept thrashing and my chest kept heaving and I made these ugly sounds of fear the more and more it kept going on. I have gotten used to this but in the middle of a particularly bad one I feel just as scared as the first time. I held tightly onto my pillow to try to ground myself as my stomach and chest just kept twisting, turning, my torso bending everywhere and my toes clenching hard enough to cramp my feet entirely. It was awful.\n\nAnd I could not get those words out of my head. \u2018I really just don\u2019t care\u2019. Fuck, I never thought I wanted anybody to care until somebody said they didn\u2019t. Never, do I want comfort when I am in pain, but laying on those sheets until one in the morning and fighting the urge to throw up the 1000th time my gut clenched and my body thrashed, I just wanted a friend to talk me through it, tell me stories until I could talk back, but I just felt so damn alone.\u00a0",

For some people it is deadly and without cure. If a person who suffers mental health issues such as Schizo affective disorder with bipolar one and two. They have crippling depression, anxiety and social anxiety. Paranoid hallucinations. Constant voices and shadow figures. They have taken all the prescription meds. They have had so many bad side affects due to different meds. Body twitches. More mental health issues. Night sweats. Weight gain. Nightmares. Suicidal thoughts. That\u2019s the side affect for the depression meds. More depression. They have Gone to the doctors and seen specialists. They tried various times over three decades to self medicate. Having gotten addicted to Heroin, pain pills and methamphetamine for nearly eight years desperately trying to feel past the pain. They got clean without help from rehab. They have never gone to rehab but found the strength to do what millions can not. They saw what wasn\u2019t working and changedg. It was a long hard battle and they did it without family and with very little friends. It wasn\u2019t about the drugs. It was about escaping the pain. This too came with extreme side affects. Physical Addiction was a side effect of trying to self heal. The therapists and the meds and the self medicating and all the side effects, they didn\u2019t do the job. This person has fought a long battle but find themselves too tired to go on. The pain and the sadness this person lives in has changed them. I\u2019ve watched as they have faded away in front of me. Healthy and sober. From the outside looking in you would never know the torture and the agony they live in every moment of the day. This person has asked me for permission to end their life. Not for help doing it but permission that they do it. With passion and conviction this person wants to end their life but won\u2019t or says they can\u2019t comfortably end their life if I can\u2019t be ok with it. I don\u2019t want to be ok with it but also.  I\u2019ve watched them fight this mental health fight for years and years. They have absolutely fought and it\u2019s heart breaking watching them always so broken.  I am not a religious person but I believe in something more. Should I be thinking of my beliefs or what\u2019s best for them? What if life isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for them. They seam to know what they want,emphatically. should I not listen? They have been hospitalized in mental facilities but also.. that\u2019s not a life. Not one they deserve. Should I lock them up in a dark under funded place that scares them. Force them to take meds that make them drool and feel nothing at all. Death doesn\u2019t anymore scare them. Going on with this heavy pain, that is the fear. They have a clear image of what they believe for an afterlife and they seem comfortable and ready to end this pain and move into the next whatever there is out there.     I can\u2019t live with myself if I say nothing or do nothing. I also can\u2019t live with myself knowing I am forcing someone I love to live in what they call a painful dark hell. Besides me, they have no family. No mom. No dad. No siblings or cousins. No grandparents. Just me.  His husband.",

    "text": "In 2012, when I was 19, I was working a part time job trying to find my place in the world. I had just been discharged from military service because while I was in basic training, an illness was discovered that disqualified me from service. I wasn't really sure where to go from there so I was living with my parents. \n\nI had always been close to my dad. Looking back, I was probably too emotionally dependent on my dad. There was no one I loved more, or trusted more. My mom and I didn't have a good relationship. She had a drinking problem and stressful stuff going on that she wasn't able to process and I was not yet diagnosed with Bipolar 1. Recipe for disaster.\n\nOne morning, I had the opening shift at the tech store I worked at. While getting ready, I could hear my dad outside loading up the boat to go fishing. He'd already left by the time I did.\n\nNot long into my shift, maybe 30m to an hour, my mom calls me. She insists I come home. Refuses to tell me why, just come home now. So, I apologize to my manager and yell her I have to go. This had never happened before so she understood it must be an emergency.\n\nWhen I got home, my mom was at the front door, a police officer was with her. It seems he didn't want to leave her if there was no one else with her. With the way my mom is, it made sense. When I got there, he left and all I can really remember next was my mom saying \"They can't find your father\".\n\nI don't really remember what happened immediately after. All that's still clear to me is her voice when she said that. How her voice cracked as she tried to keep it together. \n\nMy mom and I had our issues but there was never any doubt that she loved my dad. A lot of people say that their spouse is their \"best friend\" but after growing up with my parents, I'd say most of them are full of shit. Because my parents really were best friends. They always had a safe space to say literally anything. They never said a cross word about each other. Anyone who knew them knew there was no one or the other, they were \"an item\"\n\nMy dad was special to just about everyone he knew because he was such a loving and kind person. He is the only person I have ever known to truly embody unconditional love. Most people don't know what that really is until they experience it.\n\nNeedless to say, dad's death hit us like a truck. Someone who was also out on the lake, or maybe it was someone who lived on the lake, called 911 because they saw a little boat circling in place with no one inside. \n\nAfter he passed, the family basically splintered. My mom pushed me and my brother away. Kicked me out a month after his passing and we didn't speak for years.\n\nIt's been almost ten years now. My mom and I are talking again. Actually we have a pretty good relationship now.  But my birthday is tomorrow and I'll be 29. He passed away in June but for me turning 29 kinda just made it hit me that it really has been ten years. \n\nI'm not going to say it feels like yesterday or something. But it feels recent. Like it couldn't possibly been ten years ago. I don't know why ten years is so significant but that's how I feel. Has anyone else felt like this after a tragedy?",

We approached him to ask if he wanted to sit down and chat, and soon realised that he was actively slitting his wrists with a razor. We tried to stop him but he pushed us away and ran off down the road. I flagged down a couple walking nearby us to ask them for help, and they said that the guy wasn\u2019t our problem and we should just get home safe. During this time we lost track of him, and decided to phone the police for help because we thought he might die. We came across more people who we also asked to help, and they said that if he wanted to kill himself he should. Fortunately we found him again, sat with a another couple who had just stopped him jumping in the river. Whilst we were glad they were there to stop him, the man kept telling this kid that if he was going to do it then he should \u2018get on with it\u2019. The police got there and showed more empathy than everyone else put together has. As someone who has struggled with my own mental health and SH, I felt sick at the way people reacted to someone in such desperate need for help, and couldn\u2019t help putting myself in this boy\u2019s shoes.

    "text": "# Hey everyone, I'm new to Reddit. 22/M\n\nI don't really know where to start, I guess I'll start by saying I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, I deal with psychosis and I may be schizophrenic.  (I talk to myself all day, sometimes in the mirror.) I also have been dealing with extreme temperament issues my entire life and I am a Psychopath (I feel no empathy for others). I've attempted suicide on 3 separate occasions and was hospitalized each time. (Was in a coma for 2 of 3)\n\nI lose my temper QUICK and I hate dealing with it, I get mad over the smallest of things and know it's stupid as it's happening, yet I can't seem to control myself. I either fall into a fit of rage and scream at the top of my lungs or end up punching myself or objects/walls around me. I also have a HUGE problem with getting myself into trouble, I have been convicted of several violent crimes and just got out in August, that was my 23rd conviction. I did not make an account on this app to get on here and make myself seem cool, I hate everything about that part of my life. I spent almost my entire childhood inside of a jail cell, my first time being arrested was for battery. I was 13, my mom's current boyfriend had been hitting her so I grabbed a knife off of our kitchen counter and did what I had to do. Because of my age they couldn't really punish me to the fullest extent and there was a reason for my actions, so I was only sentenced to 6 months in juvenile hall. I did 4 and 1/2 months of that and was released due to good behavior. That landed me on probation though, let's just say I continued to re-offend over and over for the next few years and I spent almost 5 years in juvie overall. I wasn't able to go to public schools when I was out so I had been sent to an Alternative High School, I was working toward my last few credits and I had ended up fighting a person in the bathrooms. I had to sign a contract when I was allowed back to that school because I had been such a problem in the past. The first sign of trouble and they give me the boot. I have no education because of this and am planning to attend night school soon. I've currently been sleeping at my Mom's place, I don't have a bed (I sleep on a few blankets) which obviously hasn't been helping with my current state of mind. Now, most of you are probably thinking, why don't you get a job? Well, I live in one of the most dangerous places in the United States. People like to compare it to Iraq, you'll figure it out. The first month I was out, I went to a local gas station and was shot in my left arm and the back of my right thigh. I said I've had a few convictions so you can probably imagine the \"friends\" I've made over the years aren't so friendly. Now my PTSD is worse than ever and I'm peeping through my blinds every time a car passes.\n\nNo, I wasn't scared straight. I've been shot twice before that and I've been stabbed 3 times. Most of you might not understand the situation I'm in BUT I know most of you know how it feels to be..... fed up. Over it, I'm so sick of waking up every day wondering if someone's going to kick my door down and blow my brains out.  My family doesn't have the money to move me out of the state and I literally can't change my life for the better if I wanted to. To make the picture even bigger, there's a price on me. So it's not just a person or even persons. It's the entire south side surrounding me. I have nobody to go to, I cry every single day looking down the barrel of my pistol wondering if today is the day I go through with it.... I most likely will. Anyways I just wanted to vent/put my story out there.\n\nI hope everyone in this thread makes it through whatever you're going through. Everyone goes through different struggles in life, it just depends on what you make out of it. \n\n\\~iHateAtoms (I hate everything)",

I hate watching him miss out on all of the benefits of being that age. Its breaking my heart seeing him so nervous on his way to school in the morning that he will sometimes have a panic attack. He has a psychiatrist and a therapist. His doc has tried every med just about available with no positive results. He recently started seeing a new therapist, so no good or bad on that end but I'm praying for good results! He is so afraid of what others think of him. He thinks everyone is out to get him and that they're all talking about him. He cannot initiate a conversation with anyone outside of the house and even struggles asking a teacher a question. When covid shut down all the schools for a better part of a year, that only made things worse. His grades are exceptional and he isn't in any special education classes. His strongest subject is Algebra 3. He makes straight As in all of his classes but for some reason algebra is his thing. He is getting worse. Its getting to the point that he isn't doing any of his assignments in his classes. He is doing it at home after school. I ask him why he didn't work on them in class and he tells me it is bc of his anxiety, that he cannot concentrate. I feel terrible for him. It is literally breaking my heart. Idk what else to do or say bc most of the time it's the wrong thing or ot just doesn't help. He has another therapy session this coming Monday but doesn't see his psych doc til next month. He is currently on 3 types of antidepressants, a stimulant, meds of autism and an antihistamine for off label anxiety, which is not helping but making his skin red so he stopped taking it. Any other parents or anyone with a family member around his age living through the same as him are welcome to give any advice, info or encouraging! Thanks for reading!!",

All this stuff started around a few months ago when I started to like this certain person in my school, and at some point in almost turned into an obsession when I could only think of her. A few weeks ago however, being in school, people had figured this out and eventually she learnt about it as well. Then when her friends later asked her about me liking her, she stated that she didn\u2019t reciprocate the feelings I had for her. The first few weeks after this event went alright, but then I felt empty and felt kinda depressed. This accompanied with my anxiety and frequent anxiety attacks where I swear uncontrollably and just feel like having a heart attack, my quality of life overall has plummeted, and I feel like an empty soul running through the motions without having any enjoyment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions to improve my quality of life would be greatly appreciated.",

After some time i always start to absolutely hate them and despise everything about them, every breath they take makes me want to just yell at them to gtf out of my life. \n\nTo some degree i tell myself if they just ceased to exist i\u2019d be happier and start to convince myself of that.

Most mental health professionals I\u2019ve seen have ignored/dismissed this but it is ruining my life and making it difficult for me to live.\n\nSince I was little, I've been having these weird types of panic attacks (not sure if that's even what they are) where everything suddenly feels like a threat. It could be something as simple as a swing in a playground swaying \u2013\u2013\u00a0I see that and suddenly my brain goes into panic mode, thinking about how the swing might never stop moving, that its movements are uncontrollable, that it might cause a tornado/hurricane because when it swings it creates a little bit of air, just completely irrational thoughts that seem sane to me in the moment. It gets to the point where my thoughts spiral and everything I see, hear, feel, etc. becomes either an imminent or latent threat. Sometimes I end up completely tensing up and am even afraid of breathing, so I can't even take deep breaths or try the \"5 things\" method to calm me down. I've tried to tell myself \"okay, so what if \\[x thing\\] happens?\" but it only makes things worse because then I think that because I'm questioning my fears, the universe at large/karma/whatever is going to punish me for questioning it and make bad things happen to me. It's awful because it has such random triggers, and some of those triggers aren't even triggers sometimes.\n\nI know it has to do with a fear of losing control. I used to be on Prozac for depression, and while I was on Prozac I stopped having those kinds of \"attacks.\" I think I might try going on medication again because it's getting to the point where I can't live my life comfortably anymore.\n\nIs this a symptom of an anxiety disorder or of a larger mental illness? Every time I've tried to explain it to a mental health professional they've never really addressed it, so it makes me think it's not a big deal. Is this just me?

I tried once. Called access mental health and got set up with a therapist, I got more work hours, took them, and now have no therapist and now my work hours are cut so...  \n(Rant)   \nI need help and my boyfriend needs mental help, I'm at the end of my rope here. I am struggling to get a job or keep a job, he hasn't had a job. We've been together for 3 years and he says he's trying, and I believe him, and he shows me and he's looking, and no one is hiring. He's 21. He NEEDS a job.   \n(Important, so try to skim at least):   \nHe also needs mental health help. He is the sweetest kindest nicest guy ever except when he's not.   \nHe gets worked up and starts screaming and throwing a fit anytime I bring up literally anything. And recently because he doesn't wanna hurt me or lash out at others / the room he hits himself and he promised me he wouldn't hurt himself (I used to self harm, I've been clean like 4 yrs now) and it's scary like I'm worried he's gonna hurt himself or me and he is trying so hard to get help and no one is helping him. He even went to the hospital with me and they gave him meds and said to wait for access mental health and he's waited like three months and nothing and then they just told him the cancelled the pyschatrist.    \n I don't even know how it happens but we're fine talking about something simple and then he's yelling and getting aggressive. He's grabbed me before, hurt me, by accident by shoving or grabbing or throwing stuff etc the whole bang, and everyone that I've told says to leave him oh just leave him etc but like first off we've been together three years, it's not that easy and second off I have been financially supporting him for three years I'm not rich, how do I just up and leave? Yes I have family but they are also HUGE trauma source for me and it would be rly bad to move back.   \nHe's laid down infront of me and held onto me so I can't leave, he's unlocked the bathroom door on me when I refused to talk to him etc like really really not healthy stuff...  \nThe one time he started hitting himself and I walked out and he went and locked himself in our closet and started screaming something over and over!   \nAnd additionally, he's not like beating me and he's not trying to hurt me either, he just gets extremely worked up. It's never like \"I'm going to hurt you\" etc...but he does get really, really bad like stuff I can't even believe is happening bad.  \nHe has contacted access mental health and they aren't doing anything. He contacted our doc and they gave him meds and they aren't helping. He got prescribed a different one and we are going to try tomorrow but like I don't think there's anything that is going to instantly help this...   \nHe had an appointment setup for this month but the doc got sick and it got cancelled, everytime he tries to get help something ////s up and he's left standing there not sure what to do.   \nAnd the worst part is his f//ing family (that I actually care deeply about and he says they care about me but I doubt it) blames me and says I'm the issue, because he's so nice and never ever has acted like that around them before!    \nI told him today, after I was unable to go to work because he starts screaming in my face and blocking my path so I literally was unable to leave to go to fucking work that I'm done until he figures shit out.   \nYes, I have issues and I need to go get help but holy //// you can't just do that! I NEED to be able to work y'know???   \nNow he says he doesn't know how to get help and needs help to get help, I get that, I'm same way, but how the //// do I help him get work?  Especially if I'm working! And furtherly he says he is scared that if he tells them he needs help asap that they will bring him to police because he's hurt me, and I don't know how true that is but man I can't so this anymore.  \nOur relationship won't work otherwise... And I'm having a hard time keeping my own because of mental health, I can't get more hours so that I can get a car and be more reliable, I get to work 40 fucking minutes early because otherwise I'm late.   \n(Rant?)  \nAnd it hurts, I want to be good so bad I want to do good and have a good relationship and make people happy and keep working at my job, I absolutely love my job and I'm so scared because I'm going to loose it, there's nothing I can do, and I can't keep it anyway because they don't have room for me to keep working they don't have hours to give me.   \nI've stuck out my neck for them before working weird hours and they won't do the same even. I've been told stuff like \"what you expect them to split themselves in two?\" But then asked to work that exact shift afterwards, and then have them get all the hours that I need, and listen to them complain about having too many hours...  \n(Questions)  \nHow do I get mental health help?   \nHow do I help my bf?   \nDo I need to get away from him for a bit? Everyone keeps saying that but how do I do that and like what happens if he gets worse once I leave and then our relationship is just done?! I love this guy, he genuinely loves me back and he's a good guy, he doesn't want to do bad shit...  \nHow do I find work if I need to get more hours? I really don't wanna leave my job but I have to, they don't have room for me. How do I tell my work this and get the 2 weeks so I can start looking for more work???  \nHow can I help my boyfriend out?   \nThank you, sorry for the depressing as fuck convo and please let me know if this isn't right for this subreddit.   \nSorry if it's super messy and hard to understand I'm a bit upset right now.   \nPlease keep open minded. I'm kinda sick of hearing \"just leave\" it's not helpful.   \nThank you.",

Seems like the reason I've made it this far is because my immediate boss and mentor pities me and doesn't report all these slip-ups I have made, I can't stand myself any longer, I have a boiling hatred for the figure I see whenever I stand by the mirror - I'd strangle it with my hands if I could or had the guts to. I'm useless, no, I'm beyond useless. Not even a useful idiot. I can't even count fucking boxes for crying out loud! I'm a disappointment and failure by any metric, had everything handed to me in a silver plate and I still fuck up. My mind is always up in the clouds, living fantasies and imagining scenarios given my poor performance at work and in my personal life. I want to silence them, I want to bury these images and sounds but I simply can't! I try and try just to fail. \n\nI want to be normal, my life is too good for me to be this useless. Sometimes I wish I were six feet under to avoid making others for my personal hatred. \n\nI don't know what to do, I've struggled with dissociative disorders, generalised anxiety and depression for over four years but neither therapy or medication has helped me.

I need help, I'm drowning, please someone help me, please.",

    "text": "For the longest time, as long as I can even remember, i have lived within my emotional comfort zone. Many say it's normal to live life without going any further, and so i have thought too. I have thought that i am fully able to connect with others on an emotional connection. And NEVER have i actually believed that i am in reality not even in touch with myself and my emotions. \n\nEverytime i have begun to establish some sort of emotional connection or bond with another person, i have swayed back. I have been unable to take a part of the conversation without being responsive. Sometimes, i can't even say anything at all, i shut off. It's like my brain defends itself so i don't get emotionally attached. Usually, i would blame my ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). I would think that it's because my brain is too busy thinking about other things, or that i get distracted etc. But in reality, it has never been about my disorder, it has been about my emotional availability. I've had so many symptoms shown that i have blamed on my ADHD. \n\nAnother example can be the fact that i feel like I'm living my life in third-person. I know zoning out and daydreaming is normal for people with adhd, but i feel like this goes so much further than simply zoning out. \n\nI feel so out of touch with myself that i can't truly feel alive. I don't feel like I'm an actual person that has emotions and thoughts. A lot of my opinions have been given to me, have been shared to me. A lot of things that should make me feel emotional in some way, has not had an affect on me. Sometimes I've even thought of myself as a sociopath. But i don't want to hurt anybody, i simply can't comprehend and connect things on an emotional level.\n\nMaybe this is a trauma response. Or maybe i was never taught how to communicate my emotions. I have been pretty sheltered and isolated growing up.\n\nI have realized my problem, now i need to take actions to solve it. The problem is that I'm so used to living how life like this, that i have absolutely no clue what to do.\n\n\nTLDR:\n I can't connect emotionally with myself or with others. As soon as things get emotional, my brain shuts off. I feel like I'm living life in third person because I'm not emotionally available for myself. \n\nIf anyone would like to share their thoughts or experiences, i would truly appreciate it. It could mean everything to me, future me, and to everyone around me.",

    "text": "The last time my mental health was brought up to my doctor was when I was hospitalized for two weeks and treated for depression. That was almost five years ago when I was about 15. I had a severe panic attack and ended up in the hospital and got diagnosed with depression and put onto Prozac. I stopped taking the medication shortly after and stopped going to the doctor at all. \n\nMy depression isn\u2019t so bad anymore and most of it felt very situational (abusive and difficult family life)But I have since moved out at 18 and have a new set of struggles that have become too much these days and is affecting my work and school life. I used to be able to do school and work with close to no difficultly. Now I\u2019m lucky if I don\u2019t just lay in bed all day overwhelmed thinking about everything I have to do. I feel so unproductive. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019ve never considered myself as lazy and preformed very well in school until about two years ago when I started college everything just feels like it went to shit. I\u2019m constantly just exhausted. I could get the work done if I had the energy to do it. \n\nMy school/ work schedule doesn\u2019t help either. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. I work 5:30-2am saturdays- wednesdays and it pays 19 an hour because of the time. The job is 1 hour away and I have to be up at 7am for classes Monday - Thursdays. I\u2019m just too tired to focus but can\u2019t even sleep when I get home. I just feel constantly tired and lie in bed anxious about everything I\u2019m not doing that I can\u2019t get any rest. Any rest I get just feels undeserved and I can\u2019t sleep well knowing I\u2019m not getting work done that needs to be done. \n\nIm also nauseous all the time that I can\u2019t stomach a full meal which affects my health. It feels like really bad anxiety but I\u2019m trying to ignore and suppress it but I just feel like I can\u2019t anymore. I don\u2019t know how to bring up any of this to my doctor because I don\u2019t even know who my doctor is. I dont talk to my parents anymore and they have all my health care info. So I wouldn\u2019t even know how to go about getting help. \n\nMy community college offers free therapy, but I honestly think I need medication. My parents both have mental health issues and are on a lot of medications, especially my dad. So maybe it is mental health? Maybe it\u2019s situational? I dont know\u2026",

I won't go into details except to say that I resolved it. It's Monday and I'm feeling much better, I have support, and am taking my medications again.\n\nThe issue I have is that I didn't explain to anyone at work on Friday why I randomly left during break.

I live in a country where there's increasing acceptance of mental health, but still, a lot of employers can't seem to shake the feeling that 'mental health' is just another excuse for 'I didn't want to work that day'. I've only been working there for a month, and still in my probationary period, so I feel they'll simply fire me if my excuse isn't good enough.\n\nShould I lie or tell them the (vague) truth?",

I know this doesn't make me look like a good person but it's the truth. I told her about my numbness when we broke up and my voice was cracking, I wanted to cry but stopped myself.

The reason I\u2019m so worried about this is because I\u2019ve heard it starts off with little things and turns a lot worse eventually. Sometimes I also see figures in the corners of my eyes. Also sometimes I feel a little delusional because I always believe that people are against me and out to get me. I listen very deeply to other\u2019s when I can eavesdrop because I worry so much it\u2019s gossips about me being stupid and worthless. This could.

When I fall asleep I have the most vivid dreams - so vivid that they wake me up and I have trouble falling asleep again.\n\nI don't even know what I'm looking for when posting this.\n\nMaybe confirmation that it's normal to feel this way.  Maybe that I do or don't need therapy (I wouldn't even know how to talk to any medical professional about this). Maybe that I should pick up poetry and put all my miserable feelings into texts nobody will ever read. I. Don't. Know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.: sorry for rambling",

    "text": "So I\u2019ve been bottling up a lot of emotions and I\u2019ve kinda decided not to care about anyone. My family is shitty but who\u2019s isn\u2019t. My grandma died a week ago and honestly I could care less, she was an asshole and only started problems, she was pretty stupid. My mom did so much for me, but only when I was her perfect son. At some point I just went down hill, in her words I became \u201cdistant\u201d \u201casshole\u201d \u201cinsensitive\u201d \u201clike if you have no love for your family\u201d and I\u2019m not psychopath trust me, I know that. It\u2019s not the way my brain is \u201cwired\u201d I just chose this year that I wasn\u2019t gonna care for people anymore especially my family because I used to care what they did and or expected something\u2019s. But I kinda stopped doing that it was just making my life shitty. So I don\u2019t worry about they\u2019re problems or life\u2019s. The only problem is that the one thing I do care about being my dog, is now getting kicked out. I\u2019ve tried to do everything. I potty trained her, I clean her poop, I feed her l, I buy her food, I pay 100 dollars a month to keep her, I bathe her, I shave her because my mom hates the shedding, but their are times where I forget to take her out in time in the morning and she poops in the bathroom. Now my mom was about to kick her out before I started to fight with her, had this big argument and she hit me (I\u2019m 16 lol) in order to shut me up. I am so tired of not being able to express the way I feel even when it\u2019s a normal conversation she gets all offended and mad. Like what I have to say has never mattered in this house. Even now that I help with bills. \nAnyways I started yelling at her to slap me more, to keep hitting me like she\u2019s always done. Funny thing is, she didn\u2019t hit me again she just stood there shouting at me to shut up. I expected her to hit me again. In the past she has beat me up with broom sticks while I was in the floor like a fucking cockroach just spazzing out pleading her to stop and she would do it more. Telling me to stop crying as if I could just suddenly stop crying after being beaten up. But this time I told her to keep hitting me and she didn\u2019t.  Then she walked off and it happened. I started crying silently. But then she kept on talking shit from her room to me. And I just laughed, I just busted out laughing uncontrollably. But I was also still crying. Tears were coming out of my eyes but not the ones you get from genuinely laughing. The tears you get when you go through a breakup. \n\nI know I\u2019m not crazy but this was weird. I haven\u2019t cried in so long. I haven\u2019t felt like crying for anyone in so long. But loosing my dog truly hurts me.even thinking about this again is making my eyes water as my throat feels like it\u2019s knotted up.",

    "text": "   As someone studying in the medical field, honestly, the single best decision I ever made for my mental health was to get medicated. As simple as that. Even with my career choice, even I had certain prejudices towards getting treated medically for my mental health. Its not something  thats easy to confess, being in my field. I used to tell myself i didnt have a problem, its just your circumstances. I could always beat it if i just tried hard enough. I was telling myself its such a cliche, the depressed grad student in their 20s trying to find his footing, if everyone else can get through this phase of their life, so can I. Atleast thats wat i thought. I just didnt want to acknowlege it. I had too much of an ego towards it, that i would be a lesser person, that too knowing more than the average person the potential benefitis of seeking help. It was the stigma of it.\n\nCouple years back before the pandemic, i got the courage to acknowledge wat was wrong. I bit the bullet and fessed up to my primary care physician. He was enthusiastic and encouraged me to try something. I tried a few first line drugs i i used for anxiety and depression. I was suffering from side effect, ones that could potentially hold me back in my education. Thats the excuse i gave myself and stopped after trying for a couple months. I began to drink more heavily to cope and got to the point it was undeniable i was becoming an alcoholic, weather it was cuz of actual addiction or cuz of my represed anxiety/deppresion. It was most likely a mix of both in hindsight, consisting of all the stuff i didnt want to think about and chugged along using liqour as my crutch, heavily for the better part of 2 years. It was crippling anxiety and depression that i knew was creeping up and getting worse year by year.\n\nWhat lead to a change eventually was i landed up in the hospital with Acute Pancreatitis. It was a mild case but the cause was obvious and was incredibly embarrassing to and for my family, but i came out relatively fine. It became a wake up call and i told myself im going to be smart and seek help. Went back to my primary care and started trial and erroring again and eventually landed up with the right medication with minimal side affects that would not affect my proffesional life. I saught a therapist, as well as a substance abuse specialist. It was all a big change personally for me, but after a couple months of medication and some therapy, I started feeling better. I acknowledged the personal, proffesional and famillial problems that kept my issues going for years, and made whatever changes I could to address them. I was still very much myself but just felt my crippling physical symptoms of my anxiety just fade away. The chest heaviness and constant negative thoughts from slowly started to dissapate. It hasnt been perfect but it wass doing its job. I still felt like myself but just better.\n\nI came to the realization that, tho i had a number of issues in my personal life that initiated and continued to to contribute to my mental state, my problem had become a chemical one, and i needed to recalibrate. Getting help for it was so easy compared to what i worked myself up over it to be. Studying pychoactive pharmacology is differant from actually experiencing it, but now that im finally on medication, it makes me feel like an idiot why I didnt seek help before.\n\nEverything isnt 100% better, but all my physical symptoms like chest heavines from anxiety just dissapated. I redicovered some of the joy and happiness i had when i was much younger. Its been kind of wierd, but i just became less dead inside. I noticed my empathy came back into my life. I find myself experiencing legitamate emotions again, rather than just the dreary murkiness i kept myself in for so many years. Movies and music started to really move me, more than usual but not in a crazy mentally unstable way. I was just connecting more to the characters. It was my empathy and appreciation coming back. I cried sometimes in movies before but now i get way more emotional and easily with whatever struggles the characters are going thorugh. Movies ive already seen get to me on a rewatch. I was constantly teary eyed. This is all from legitimate emotional moments mind you, i havnt become crazy and cry during something like Jackass. I'd probably laugh way more tho. I went to go see Spiderman: No Way Home over christmas and im pretty sure that movie made me cry more than any movie before. And ive seen Shawhank Redemption...I was teary alot through some of the first half, and I was balling for the last hour. And you kno wat? It felt good. It felt good to cry in those moments. \n\nI Feel like an idiot for not doing this 5 years ago. So much could have been different. I dont see my pills as an embarrassment, but like a lifeline, especially when i saw signs of it working. Now i see it as a friendly aid today. Whether they will still be there in my life 10 yrs from now is a question i wont get answered till i get there. \n\nI kno what im going through pales in comparison to what alot of others are going through, and the problems in my life are a dream when compared to others. What I will say though is that whatever the cause or circumstance, everyone is going through something, and their are avenues to help. So im writing this whole preamble to get to a point. If you feel like you may be suffering from any form of mental health issues that are impeding on your life, whether it be anxiety or depression or OCD etc, and you are willing to acknowledge it and are willing to put in the effort into feeling better, please seek help, whatever form that may be. Regardless of what the state of our healthcare system is in, along with the beaurocracy and politics to go with it, dont forget that alot of the world can not get access to even the most basic of health care. There are people right now suffering in the other side of the world from things way worse than finding attainable healthcare. Im lucky im from Masschusettes, home of the best health care in the world. I would be and was an idiot for knowing i needed help and not taking advantage of the perks of living here.\n\nAs someone in Medicine I can say we are, moving forward, actively trying to prioritize and integrate mental health more into your care, along with triying to make mental health services more easily attainable for you. We believe mental health wellness and your physical health are very much connected in more ways than we have previously thought. So you may surprised what services are or have been made available to you. These are  privileges that we take for granted every day. So for all the problems in our health care system, atleast try to seek help. For some people all it takes in bettering your mental health lifestyle changes and better self care. For some its incorporating more exercise into their life. For others its therapy. And if your are willing, medication.\n\nTLDR: I avoided seeking mental health care for a long time and became basically an alcoholic who landed up the hospital. I saught help after that and feel better. I was surprised on how much of an affect seeking out medication and some mental health services changed how i feel despite my hesitancy. My message to you is to not be discouraged from your preconceived notions or what people have taught you. Mental Health is not for the crazy. Its for everyone.\n\nThis was typed in a stream of consciousness, so if its all over the place, I apologize. Started out as a comment, ended up with this.\n\nThanks for reading\ud83e\ude7a",

So my best friends have been spending time with my other friends, and hardly any time with me. I know I can join them but I\u2019m scared of doing so, because last time I joined them they just ignored me. It was like I was a ghost walking around speaking but nobody could see or hear or even know I was there. Whenever I would say something I would just not be heard or be ignored. I haven\u2019t been joining them uninvited because I\u2019m scared of being ignored again. People have told me to let it go and let them go, but that\u2019s way easier said than done. When I try to let it go and let them go it just makes the happy times and memories come back in my head and makes me even more depressed that I might be losing them. I\u2019m scared of losing those I care about, this might sounds crazy but my friends are like my family. Since I haven\u2019t had much social interaction I\u2019m still learning to deal with the feeling of being third wheeled and replaced. So most time I\u2019m not quite sure how to go about it and whether I should tell them or not. Should I tell my best friends how I\u2019m feeling?

With the way the world is right now its been making me really sad, i have 2 young kids with a 3rd on the way. I have been working and pushing myself extremely hard for the past 10 years, my parents split up when i was 16 and my mom left. \n\nI stayed with my dad which was a mistake because of how abusive he ended up being once my mom had left. I was the only one left at home and i was the one he took all his frustation out on. He was a long haul truck driver so he was usually gone 3/4 weeks a month, which is why i stayed. He was abusive to my mom and when she left she was shattered, i didnt think me staying with her wouldve helped, i think looking back it wouldve helped us both recover faster. \n\nI worked a full time job from the moment she left, dropped out of school because of my anxiety and depression. Bordered on alcoholism and drug abuse for a while, wouldve ended up dead if not for my wife.

Its just never enough, i never feel like i can get ahead. \n\nLately its been really bad, i cry every day at work, ive lost almost 20lbs in 2 months, i dont want to get out of bed, i want to quit my job, i want to give up. But every time i see my kids i just think \"i do it all for you\". I just feel so lost, so hopeless. I know so many other people are in the exact same situation as me and that also kinda breaks my heart. No one deserves to feel like this. Ever. I just want to be okay...i thought i was...i went to therapy, i take my meds, i try so hard...and it never feels like its enough...maybe i just need to try something else...\n\nSorry for the novel...just let loose i guess",

My name is Jaycee Quick and I\u2019m 21 years old. I\u2019ve been facing severe mental health issues that I\u2019ve tried avoiding for such a long time now and depression is the demon that haunts me endlessly more than any other. One thing that no one ever told me about depression was how many days and nights I would sit here in my pitch black room with my empty gun in my hand held against my head pulling the trigger and hearing it click hoping one day I\u2019ll have the balls to load one in the chamber. The deepest depths of my soul know it\u2019s not the answer but my mind says otherwise. The agony of human suffering is something I\u2019ll never be able to understand. I face the same questions all of humanity has faced when it comes to death. What\u2019s it really like ya know? I also hate the fact that I\u2019m still just a boy and not the man I should be at this age. I hate the fact that I don\u2019t have the balls to do what\u2019s necessary for me to get better mentally. I hate that I have to deal with all of these thoughts and emotions alone. I know others suffer much more than I could ever understand and for that I feel guilty feeling the way I do. I don\u2019t want to invalidate what it is I feel and I wish the way I feel was something I could fix without having to face the demons inside myself like depression. For those that feel alone and miserable I want you to know that I feel that way too. Sometimes I feel like today might be the day I finally put the bullet in the chamber and then it\u2019s all over but I hope somewhere someone will read this and understand it and relate to me. I don\u2019t mean to dump all of this out there seeking pity or anything from anyone. The only thing I seek is for just one more person to know and understand what it is I feel so that maybe they can not feel as alone and broken as I do. We all might have a destiny or maybe we all might be just floating around existing for the sake of existence but today I\u2019m choosing to exist one more day hoping someone will see this and choose to go on one more day too. Whoever it is that reads this if anyone reads it at all know that I love you and I want you to keep going for just another day so that I can know it\u2019s possible for us to keep going together. We don\u2019t get another chance if we end it all. Thank you guys.",

He fidgets with his fingers, swings foward and backwards in his chair or just constantly moving his feet around (I don't know what it is called, its like the thing you do when you are waiting.) I also feel like he has problems with focusing and remembering things. I could talk to him for 30 minutes, and then he just asks what we are talking about. He also doesent remember things that we talked about just minutes earlier. He also told me he has problems focusing in school. One example he told me is that he just stared at a fly for an entire class instead of the teacher. He also does weird stuff with his things.  He has to place his stuff (when he puts a thing down) exactly 90 degress at the side of the table, or it has to be symetrical to the edge. Also, whenever he presses a button, he presses it 6 times. Every. Single. Button. He does it religiously. The last example I have, is whenever he goes to the toilet, he spits in the toilet exactly 6 times. Knowing all of this, I am just lost at what to do. He refuses to go to the doctor and he said he whould run away if I made him go there (He also has a fear of doctors). What do you think? Does he have somekind of mental problem? Every piece of advice is appriciated, I've lost hope a bit. And again, apologies for my poor english.",

You need to fit as a human being into a society you cant just be alone)\n\nAlso fun part I don\u2019t not ONLY have aspergers, I am gay which makes me feel even lonelier, cuz number one, almost all gay people are heavily steriotyped so the potential mates is heavily low.

    "text": "Hey all. &lt;3 I'm heading someplace really bad and I don't know if I can climb out of this one. Trigger warnings for suicide and world events.\n\nFor context: I'm 30 years old, diagnosed with DID, depression and generalised anxiety. I'm medicated for depression and high heart rate, with optional limited supply benzos for bad panic attacks and breakdowns, but honestly, the past while, I've been taking them at night just to get a couple hours of sleep. I'm being assessed for autism and ADHD, and suffered a horrible mental health breakdown/burnout when I was 11 years old, after which I lost my ability to participate in society - I've been living on government aid since turning 18, and have very little ability to function in the everyday sense. Taking care of myself and feeding the pets takes literally all of my energy, so you can imagine what the house looks like.\n\nI've had a few major fears in my life since early childhood. Being Finnish, Russia was always one of them. War, in general. Another one was a global pamdemic, which sprouted around the time the bird flu started appearing. Cancer is the third, though let's hope it stays off the list of things I'm now living with.\n\nThe pandemic has been tiring. I don't know how else to put it. I have barely left my house. I'm not scared of it - haven't been since the beginning - just tired, submissive to it. Most recently, I didn't see a single person in real life for four months, discounting a family gathering for Christmas (five hours) and the cashiers who check out my groceries at the store. The only friend I see locally lives 200 miles away. My town is very small (about 7 000 people), and there's nowhere here to go, not that I'd have the energy to do that anyway. My income is so small that I typically go a week of the month without anything on my account. So this is life. I have a good group of friends online, mostly from the States, who I talk to in a call every day. We play video games, which is a somewhat productive thing to be doing socially speaking. So I'm not lonely most of the time, but being this isolated, the lack of any real interaction, human touch, sensory fulfillment, I don't want to know what this period of time has done to my brain.\n\nI'm in treatment - I have a wonderful online therapist, a trauma/dissociation specialist for my DID since there was no means for me to get one locally (treatment for DID seems to simply not exist at all in Finland, I was handed my diagnosis and kicked out of the outpatient clinic as too difficult to treat and told to find a therapist, which there were about three of that I could physically reach, none that were taking patients.) I've been with her for about a year, and we've made a lot of progress in that time. I was approaching a level of functionality I haven't ever had before, with established self-care routines and everything. Then the four month isolation hit. And then Russia. Constant flood of \"it's going to be a nuclear world war, everybody's going to die.\" I'm too tired to care at this point. Everything feels so pointless, hopeless. I've never gotten the chance to be happy or feel loved by anyone. I've never worked a job and I'm never going to have a family. I've never had enough money to do anything. I have a disorder from chronic childhood trauma that made developing normally impossible, and spent my teens self-harming and wanting to die, being unsafe at home and constantly mistreated by powers above me. My twenties, I remember nothing but the never-lifting fear, spending months trapped in psychotic paranoia, unable to sleep, unable to think about anything but dying, how I either wanted to or feared I would.\n\nSo, like I said, this is life. If it isn't Russia that will kill me, even then I'm the lowest of the low in social hierarchy - any support to people like me is always conditional, always the first to go. I am very, very obviously not only mentally ill and neurodivergent with at least a learning disability but, like described above, likely autism as well - but visibly LGBT as well. I have a history of medical transition, though I live and present as my assigned gender today, but even ignoring that it's obvious things hormonally/developmentally are not normal for me, I am utterly unable to act like I'm normal. My attraction is primarily same-sex, with a very, very deep-seated fear of men (I have a single male friend and I would neither be in the same room alone with him nor ever trust him as far as I can throw him in a real world situation - he is not, as far as I have any evidence for, dangerous in any manner but to me, every male is a threat. I did not make friends with him because I wanted to - rather, he is part of my friend group and considers me a close friend of his.) There is no way on earth I could ever pass as gender conforming or heterosexual. I never have, not even as a child. And watching anti-LGBT sentiments and far right ideology rising everywhere in the world, even if the pandemic and the Russian invasion didn't exist, I'd have a difficult time looking ahead.\n\nAdd to this the other wordly worries I can't do anything to control, like climate change.\n\nI don't see any hope anymore. My DID system has good communications and we've discussed the situation briefly - all agree that there is a point where suicide will become an option that we will seriously consider. It feels that the only thing at this point that we have a measure of control over is how we want to die, and we'd rather it be on our terms than waiting for an enemy's weapon or other violence, persecution, homelessness, starvation, exposure to take care of it. Right now, we still have the option of passing away in our sleep, making it as comfortable for ourselves as we can. Nobody here wants to die. Not one of us. But it doesn't feel like there's any hope for a life worth living ahead. There is no glimmer of light out there at this point. There is only evil, pain, and fear.\n\nSo I don't know what to do. We've tried expressing these feelings to our therapist, but she presses that we simply have to accept that we don't have control, and focus on the now. The now is full of grief and fear and isolation and loneliness and unresolved trauma with no hope for a better future. I suffer from heavy amnesia, a core symptom of DID, so I have absolutely no recollection of a life before it became this way. All I remember is fear and injustice and struggle. I don't believe I've ever had the smallest chance for happiness before and now I definitely don't see one approaching.\n\nIt feels like I wasn't made for this world. I'm too fucking soft, always were, to survive it. I don't know what I'm expecting from this. I don't expect anyone to have a solution. I guess I just wanted to reach out.",

I have a  media degree, which also gets torn apart because everyday people don't know what to do with it and its hard to join the film industry cold turkey. I'm still working on my screenplays. \n\nI have 3 months until my lease is up and I am so lost right now. \n\nBased in Australia, I'm very close to quitting my job, putting my stuff into storage and backpacking through New Zealand when they open again in July. \n\nI mentioned this to my mother who was relieved that I was finally leaving so that I don't annoy her anymore. She also mentioned just recently how strange it is that I don't have a partner and kids at my age. \n\nIt sucks not having anyone who supports who you are or what you want to do in life.\n\nAnyone out there who is struggling right now, I hear you!",

    "text": "Hello everybody, I am looking for people that might share the same experience as me regarding their mental health. I am a 30 years old woman and in the past two and half years (I stopped going this August) I was in therapy to help me cope with depression. My therapist said that is not a severe case, I just suffer from \"episodes\", that's the term she used, and in the period I was doing therapy I got really better in many ways.\n\nThe thing is that, despite being more conscious and able to manage myself, I keep having really bad moments, either I can't eat or sleep (the latter is the worst) I keep crying with no reason, I am unable to focus and in the worst cases I have really bad thoughts about how to end my suffering (that I do not intend to follow, they just pop up in my mind).\n\nThe thing about this episodes I keep getting is that, in my opinion, they are related to a monthly cycle: fifteen days before I am expecting menstruation I start to feel more and more sad and anxious and everything crumble around me (I stop eating or sleeping, I don't respect deadlines, get in argument with friends, stop calling my parents ecc...). During my period or immediately before/after everything return to \"normal\". The things in my life that make me sad or anxious are still there of course but I feel able to keep going with my life and solve the issues (if possible).\n\nI talked about this correlation I see to a psychiatrist, my therapist, two gynecologist and endocrinologist and everybody kind of dismissed me. Everybody said to me that premenstrual syndrome can affect the mood of a person but only in the three/four days before the menstruation arriveb and not in a such strong and pervasive way and also that fifteen days is a long amount of time to be considered PMS.  Either they don't see a correlation or they say I am exaggerating.\n\nI respect the doctor and the medical knowledge that I lack but I am starting to feel really tired and overwhelmed by this thing, the feedback I got from these various doctors made me feel like I am \"crazy\", so I would like to know if someone has experienced something similar and can share It with me how to get proper help",

My mom told me that \u201cNo matter who you befriend in life, your friends will never have your back like your family does\u201d I always just used to play off what she said like \u201cyea yea sure\u201d because to me my friends were loyal, me and my friends would have fun hanging out and they were they only two people i ever hung out with. I always talked so nicely about them and i would always be texting them or going places with them and what not. But last year, in like November something happened with me and my family and i didn\u2019t talk to them for almost a month, maybe a bit more than that. Once i did reach out to them again I apologized for not talking to them and told them that something had happened with my family and that I was sorry for not responding to them. They never texted me back, and i was honestly hurt and disappointed. I thought so highly of these two friends, my only friends that i had, i have no more real life friends. But i thought so highly of them and I would always drive them places and we would hang out and what not, and i was so shocked too that they were straight up ignoring me even after i told them why i didn\u2019t respond and i apologized. after a week i checked our discord server, all 3 of us had a discord sever together that we owned and I saw that they had removed all my permissions to edit the server settings and demoted me to just a member. Now I know that it\u2019s just a server but it felt more like a final message to me letting me know that they weren\u2019t the loyal friends i thought they were. I thought back to what my mom said about my friends and i was kind of frustrated that she was right, but this also made me love my mom even more, cause no one cares of me the way she does, not even my \u201cfriends\u201d. I also saw a post by one of them about how my two ex friends and some other people were all going to museums and doing things that we said we would do together. The whole thing just has had me in a bad mood these past few weeks and i just wanted to tell it to someone, even if it be strangers on the internet, because i don\u2019t have anyone to listen to my problems, i mostly just do the listening. Thank you for listening.",

    "text": "TL;DR: I have depression. Father and sister are angry with me for not going to a Christmas party, which I said I wouldn't be able to attend, and haven't spoken to me since.\n\nI have been struggling with my mental health over the past 6-12 months(ish), and have continued seeing the same therapist who had previously helped me through my anxiety issues. Recently I started taking medication for depression, and I'm pretty hopeful that will help me further.\n\nSo my sister and father have... pretty strong characters. They see the world in their way and are generally not very intuitive when it comes to empathy. My parents have been divorced for over 20y.\n\nWhen I told my father a while back I have been struggling, he basically just said it's because I don't do enough; I need to go out more and see more people. Thing is, we got a dog in June 2020 (which we had been planning for since a year prior). We now have friends in the neighbourhood we see almost everyday for walks, often go for big walks in weekends, ... So I've been more social/active than pre-pandemic to be honest. He's always been very pushy about things, and quite guilt tripping when I didn't want to/couldn't. He's also not very reliable when it comes to agreements.\n\nThen there's my sister. I honestly always got along with her pretty well, but she can be... quite the fury. The relationship started to break last september when she was throwing her son a birthday party. My mom was going through cancer treatment so my sister wanted to have a \"potentially last\" big party with her. I knew she didn't feel good enough to go to a party, let alone with the fear of maybe catching something. But when I had my sister on the phone on my own birthday a couple weeks prior she ended up making me cry and feel so bad about not feeling okay to come and be around many people, even though it was all family.\n\nSuffice to say the thought of having to call either of them makes me nervous, especially lately.\n\nThe final straw happened end of December, a week before Christmas my father decided he wanted a last Christmas party at his house with me, my sister and our partners. In the same call he mentioned he was selling his house in January.   \nI ended up telling him that week wasn't ideal, and specified that on Wednesday evening at 7 we'd be getting our covid booster shots. He threw a hissy fit and hung up. Queue a couple days later I receive an email that we are invited for Christmas dinner on... you know it: Wednesday at 7. I repeated myself saying that does not work because of the booster shot. To which he replied \"Since when do they vaccinate at night?\". I didn't feel like it was worth replying to this, I made my point that I wouldn't be there.  \nNot unimportant to add: my partner and I have both been sick after each shot, she usually goes to sleep before 9, and currently has trouble with night blindness. So obviously we don't feel comfortable to go then, as we feel it's unsafe.\n\nFast forward to that Wednesday. We got our booster shots and were waiting the 15min before we could go when I start getting calls from my dad. Being where I did I didn't pick up and just sent a picture of the waiting room.  \nDad: \"Please a word of explanation. Do we wait with dinner?  \nMe: \"No you don't have to wait.\"  \nDad: \"The question is: What time will you be here?\"  \nI didn't reply to this as we were going back to the car to go home.  \nDad: \"...what time...\"\n\nAnd that is the last I have heard from him. Over the next couple weeks I tried calling my sister to maybe talk about it and maybe through her try to mend things a little bit but there was never any response, so eventually I sent her a text in the sense of \"hey I've been trying to call to see how you guys are, but must be calling at the wrong times :)\". This was not the case, she is also angry with me and is refusing to talk to me.\n\nI've been talking about this with my wife, my mom, my brother, psychologist, doctor, friends, you name it. Everyone has different suggestions on how continue, but the general consensus is put my own mental health first.  \nThing is, I don't feel bad about how they're feeling, I only feel sad about the situation. I feel no need to talk to them since I realised how much the idea of talking to them stressed me out.\n\nWhat do you think?",

to therapy anymore. i know i have bpd through my own thorough research and confiding in two friends with diagnosed bpd, both having near identical experiences as mine. i also have \u201cdiagnosed\u201d social anxiety, mdd, panic disorder, adhd (i dont trust the psychiatrist i went to so i\u2019m not sure if this is misdiagnosis due to bpd stigma, i fit all the criterias tho) and i\u2019m constantly struggling in daily life. it doesn\u2019t help that i live in a toxic household with a narcissist mom, a mostly absent dad and an older sister that couldn\u2019t care less about me. they don\u2019t believe that i\u2019m mentally unstable, they think i\u2019m being dramatic. my dad is a bit more nice about it but he\u2019s almost never home so i\u2019ve never been able to confide in him either. i\u2019ve been to a psychiatrist twice and was prescribed medication immediately but it didn\u2019t help at all because my mom was there with me n she made it look like my depression was due to lack of social life, it is not. this painted an incomplete picture in front of the psychiatrist though n the only advice he gave me was to \u201cgo out more\u201d and then come back in 2 weeks, i did try that but i couldn\u2019t remain consistent because i ended up having a depressive episode and my mom never took me back to him after. i can\u2019t go back again now either because my mom is close to him and i know she\u2019s gonna twist everything again if i start talking about her emotionally abusive behavior towards me. i was planning on just enduring it until i was able to move away for college but i don\u2019t think thats possible anymore, my grades are awful (i get an average of 60-80%) and though my dad is rich, he won\u2019t send me away to the states unless i get a scholarship which i can\u2019t with my current grades. i can try to improve my grades this year but they\u2019re most likely not gonna get me a scholarship anywhere because our uni applications start this year in august so the applications will mainly focus on my previous grades. i haven\u2019t been able to do anything academically outstanding to make up for my grades either because of my anxiety. i\u2019m terrified at the thought of staying here for longer than i need to and i\u2019m starting to feel suicidal once again. i cant confide in anyone properly, my friends know but i don\u2019t wanna burden them with my problems especially when they have their own to deal with. my parents genuinely do not give a shit about me, no matter how much i try to get them to understand they never will. my mom has literally seen my self harm scars twice and both times she told me to stop being (r slur) and get closer to god. my sister is the same, she\u2019ll act like she cares but the second i don\u2019t do what she says, she\u2019ll use it against me. its always been like this so i\u2019m not hurt by these things as much anymore but the thought of having to deal with it until i\u2019m able to move out at 20 or something is beyond fucking terrifying i\u2019d rather die than stay here but i don\u2019t know what to do to help myself. i\u2019ve tried managing my bpd symptoms so i don\u2019t lash out at them and make the situation worse for myself but it doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s too much to unpack and i can\u2019t do it alone. i just got out of a 3 year relationship as well, he was the only one who kept me grounded but he took advantage of that and gaslit/manipulated me throughout. i feel so lost now, i genuinely don\u2019t know how i\u2019m supposed to continue to live like this. i\u2019ve tried so hard to be there for myself but there is not a single corner in this house that makes me feel safe. i don\u2019t even have my own room to lock myself in, i have to share a room and a bed with my sister that treats me like i have the plague because i sometimes have poor hygiene during my depressive episodes. i\u2019ve been trying to be better and prevent that frok happening often though, but she never sees that and there\u2019s no other room i can stay in unless my dad goes out of town again (my parents sleep in separate rooms so i\u2019ve started to move into his room when he\u2019s gone) which he does often but when he\u2019s back home, my mental health goes from 6 to a -1 and i can\u2019t say anything about it because he\u2019s gonna stop coming home completely and i don\u2019t want that. i genuinely don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\nfor more context about my lack of access to therapy: i live in a third world country where mental health is still a taboo, there\u2019s not many good options and my mom would never take me to another psychiatrist because she doesn\u2019t trust them. i tried online therapy but it wasn\u2019t a good experience, they made me wait for 2+ hours only to ask to reschedule it for the next day when i was in school lol. it was a free session so i didn\u2019t mind but i\u2019ll definitely not be trying that again so i don\u2019t have any other options left. \n\nadditional info: i think i\u2019m also vulnerable to addiction because of my recent urges to get high or vape and addiction also runs in the family (my aunt is an alcoholic and my dad is a smoker) i haven\u2019t done anything yet but thats only because i haven\u2019t gotten the chance to, if i ever do then i know i\u2019ll take it immediately and we\u2019ll just have to see what happens after \n\ni usually cope by binge watching shows or talking to my friends to keep myself occupied. if i don\u2019t do this i get all kinds of thoughts and the urge to self harm or run away gets stronger and i just end up feeling like shit but i\u2019ve recently started to go out for a walk too, though its not ideal cus i have to go with my mom and it\u2019s draining to have to constantly be around her, knowing the damage she\u2019s done to me. i also recently got into makeup and dress up at odd times just to feel good about myself, which helps me cope a bit so i\u2019m doing okay for now. i just wanted to let this out because i don\u2019t know how long i can continue with these coping mechanisms, i\u2019m already getting tired of them.",

    "text": "I'm gonna give you some context to understand the situation. My mental health has been severely bad from the age of 12 but due to many reasons I was not sent to a professional to get help. This however changed a year ago.(I'm now 17) my therapist soon realised that I was mentally ill and I was diagnosed with severe depression and ptsd. However after some months my therapist and psychiatrist realised that I was schizophrenic. I've been having these symptoms for many years and thought that they were normal so I was tormented for years.. first of all even tho it was clear that I was dealing with schizophrenia my therapist and psychiatrist didn't tell me directly. For example when I asked some questions to my psychiatrist he was referring to it as a disorder that made me hear voices etc never saying the word schizophrenia..they didn't was to get into details about it and it seemed like they were kind of hiding stuff from me...also when My therapist found out about it she was kinda...excited I can't describe it but she seemed interested in it in the wrong way which made me feel like a test subject. For instance I was clearly upset because I was explaining what a hard time I'm having with some of the symptoms and she seemed enthusiastic (she was smiling also). Moreover some months ago my depression was getting better but due to my eventful life that didn't last long.. so after some time of being okay I was at my worse not being able to take a bath,get out of bed, eat etc also my mindset was really negative and I was having suicidal thoughts. For many weeks during my sessions I was telling my therapist over and over again that my mental health was not okay and she would intentionally let me be at my worse. This continued for 2 months I was so mad because I felt like I was not validated.. I confronted her and she told me that she wanted to see for how long me being down would last..I felt so misunderstood and alone...I found it wrong.. and the last thing is that both of us realised that there was the possibility of me having a personality disorder (might have to do with the schizophrenia idk) but she was never open about it leaving me in the dark.. she told me that there is no reason in knowing what I have because I will give it too much validation and it will be harder for me to get over it... I found this wrong because I was having a hard time with the symptoms and just wanted to know what is wrong for me...imagine going to the doctor and telling them your arm hurts really bad and they just decide to not tell you what is wrong with it.. that's how I felt...my therapist explained that it's not the same (refering to the example I said) but idk am I overthinking all this?was it okay? Am I just exaggerating? For me it didn't feel right...that's it sorry for the long text:)",

I'm living with my mom and sibling but I get anxious even interacting with them most of the time. I spend all day watching YouTube,TikTok and reading fanfiction. I wake up and immediately regret it and only look forward to going to sleep so I don't have to worry about everything. I don't have any friends or people to talk to and am shaking and anxious just thinking about posting this knowing someone will read it. \n\nFrankly my life is pathetic and Im wishing I could just stop dealing with it the only reason I'm still here is because of my sibling and mom but recently I keep hearing voices telling me they'd be better off if I died. Honestly no one would miss me besides them since I've effectively stopped living in the sense no one has seen me and I just kind of exist trapped in my room laying on a popped air mattress and waiting to die.",

One thing I've noticed is that (especially on tiktok) people make it out to be something that it's not. For example many people associate tics and tourettes with going around screaming curse words, but only 10% of people with tourettes have verbal tics. And only 44% have severe tics, that means that a majority of people with tourettes may have few to none tics, you might not even notice them. Also, people forget that tourettes isn't only about having tics, it also affects your brains \"speed\" and capacity, which for me and other people I know Is a way bigger issue than having tics. I studder, have sleep issues and struggle to read because of my tourettes, and that sucks waaaaaay more than the few tics I have, so next time you hear something about tourettes, be sure to remember that it's different for everyone and that it's not always visible.",

Quetiapine/Seroquel in the US was the one I used the most but made me near to the point of being vegetative and the Drs just wanted to up the dosage. Because most of the time I look coherent and to the naked eye I would just look like I was \u201caway with the fairy\u2019s\u201d I don\u2019t think I would be eligible for disability allowance. Even after suicide attempts due to the mental health services in my area being very packed I was sent home after a stay in the A&amp;E. I\u2019ve luckily managed to deal with these issues over the years and worked jobs and had relationships etc but it\u2019s still very crippling I self medicate I with benzodiazepines and sometimes alcohol more than I should and I feel it\u2019ll probably be my downfall. \n\nI said I\u2019d try to make this short but I guess that hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nThe closest I\u2019ve gotten to feeling at peace is when I used mindfulness techniques and studied Buddhism and meditation but with work and being someone with little discipline at the moment it\u2019s hard to get into a good cycle again. \n\nAfter telling many psychiatrists about my symptoms I don\u2019t fall under the the catergories of a paranoid schizophrenic as I can tell my voices are not other people using telepathy which is what these symptoms try to fool me into believing my and I don\u2019t hear them like they are in the room so I just go into the undiagnosed mental health area. \n\nDon\u2019t really know what outcome I expect from this post just needed to vent and telling people is tough and when I have in the past it\u2019s something that will expectedly scare people or have them look at you like a vulnerable victim which I probably am. \n\nThank you any responses welcome",

CLONAZEPAM 2MG TAB (1/2 tab when necessary)\n\nim really concerned about Seroquel here. I think the psychiatrist mainly prescibed me with Seroquel (**Quetiapine)** because I mentioned something along the lines of struggling to sleep sometimes. Now Im not sure whether its worth it to take it even in a low dose since im concerned about the side effects where people gain weight whereas im trying to lose weight and i dont really have bad insomnia. (I can handle it)There's also an article on Verywell mind saying that Seroquel should be considered as an anxiety treatment only when other anxiety medications like Prozac, Zoloft and, Celexa have proven to be ineffective. I have not tried any of those medicines before. Also, people in the psychiatry subredddit mostly were not okay with using Seroquel as a sleep aid.\n\nSo pls help me here( btw this is my first time taking these kind of drugs) :\n\n1. Should i still take Seroquel since there are a few studies suggesting that it might help with anxiety acccording to a few studies or just skip taking it all together since the risks probably outweigh the benefits?\n2. I also have terrible driving anxiety. I simply cant drive and it terrifies me. (Im 18, who just started learning how to drive, but always get panic attacks during driving lessons and sweat a lot) When I mentioned this to my psychiatrist he told me to took xanax and klonopin as he prescibed but then i also read that people shouldnt drive under the influence of Benzos. So what im supposed to do here? Just take those benzos anyways or is there any other alternative to help with my driving anxiety?\n\nI know i cant expect very credible medical advices here.. but please share what you know regarding my situation as it can help me out a lot..Thanks!",

I basically did a bad thing that I regret nothing crazy though. but I have this fear of impending doom that one day ill get arrested for it and my whole life will be over and I hate it. I had a panic attack at the library today and I had to leave really fast. I have Bipolar II disorder and OCD which makes it difficult to deal with my thoughts. I have these thoughts in my head and they stop me from living an enjoyable life. I just hate myself and feel like garbage because I have done this thing and I feel like ill never live a normal life because of it. I just don't know what to do. I talked to my friends about it and they said it was no big deal and that nobody really cares that I did it. However, I know logically that I wont get in trouble for it but my brain lies to me and bosses over the thought that I will either go to hell or get in trouble for it which both are false. I was hoping that maybe you guys could just tell me Im not a bad person and tell me some techniques to forgive myself and move on. I didnt hurt anybody or do anything hurtful to anyone but it just sucks that I feel like I cant live a normal life because of it.",

    "text": "I guess this is a hot take. And it's not the normal post here so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets removed but.\n\nI've noticed that everyone thinks they're a therapist and they have all the answers to trauma, healing, and therapy now because of TikTok. (i.e. That toxic guy you dated isn't a narcissist just because the relationship went bad)\n\nBut it just gets under my skin at how quickly they'll tell people they don't even know that if their healing from trauma they cannot love or be loved. \n\nBut if they were really in therapy they would know that's not true. AT ALL.\n\nYou need to be committed to healing, to loving yourself and to learn boundaries before entering a relationship yes. You must learn the importance of recognizing bad habits and communicating when you're unhappy and build enough self awareness to be able to verbally communicate when you're triggered and how your partner can help. Yes. Sure. It even helps to understand that you must seperate past trauma and experiences from current experiences and not deflect things onto your partner. Yes. Absolutely. \n\nBut despite what people might say- your trauma does *not* define you. It does *not* define when you're ready to love someone again.\n\nYou *can* heal while still being in a loving relationship.\n\nInfact you must *first* experience a normal healthy relationship *to heal* from past toxic relationships.\n\nIt sounds shitty and counterintuitive but hear me out-\nBecause as a trauma and abuse survivor this is how it was framed to me be my own therapist...\n\nAll the bad behaviors you learned to protect yourself in toxic relationships from the past will gradually be unlearned as you understand that love is *not* conditional. You will learn that you won't be abandoned for voicing your upsets and that you are safe. \n\nMost importantly by entering into a healthy loving relationship after starting therapy and continuing to work on yourself, you will learn that healthy love doesn't present itself in stipulations or need to be manipulated. Because you will be loved in the most softest, kindest, patient yet thrilling ways.\n\n\nPerhaps those ways might confuse you because you're not used to them. But you not only deserve to be loved in those ways, it's just as important to understand that to be healthy you must aquire a need for that kind of love. And accept nothing less. \n\nTrust in yourself. \nTrust in your therapy. \nTrust in the awareness you have gained.\nAnd most importantly: trust the process.\n &gt;Not your friend who has never been in therapy, and thinks they know better about what you need than you do- and most definitely not internet WebMD Tiktok certified therapists.\n\nDisclaimer;;\n(Of course all of these situations are only ideal if *you* are ready to put things you've learned in therapy to use within your relationship. You must have patience with yourself and awareness to continually work at things and not self sabotage. The point is that you won't learn this until you experience it in real time with someone you love and trust. i.e. don't be an asshole and blame it on trauma. Your partner *is not* responsible for fixing you. YOU must want to fix yourself and do that work for you.)",

    "text": "Hello Reddit, a little background on me\u2026 I decided to move across the country with no family or friends right out of college and I\u2019m starting to feel really lost as to where I belong in life. I got my bachelors degree in psychology and worked my first big job as a behavioral health tech in a mental health center and I honestly couldn\u2019t take it\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it was the management or the nature of the work, but I felt like I was constantly failing with no training or guidance. It was a relatively new center and they counted on unexperienced staff like me to hold it together. Not even management knew what they were doing.. eventually after 9 months I decided I had enough and left that job with no backup plan. I tend to do that a lot which makes me frustrated with myself but luckily I had enough saved up to make it to the next job in one piece. I worked for a call center about a month and left one day because I was being teased for mental health issues which only made them worse. I left that job for a job in financial services where the boss brought me in and sought to offer me a new opportunity in a new field. It was a blessing to have a job and a new opportunity, but same thing happened not even a few months in. My mental health was declining and I was getting teased and bullied at my place of work. I ended up getting fired for a clerical mistake that I should\u2019ve been more careful about, but I had been looking for a way out for months. I was miserable and everyone could pick up on it. I am now without employment and living in a completely different state than family, and even though I\u2019ve had a couple people lend a hand out and offer a friendship, I feel completely uncomfortable accepting because I just feel like I would hurt them or bring them down. I don\u2019t really know what to do, especially considering I left my hometown trying to avoid going back to a living situation with my parents\u2026 does anyone have any advice or have gone through/ know someone who has gone through something similar? I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place here and all I can do right now is make the money however I can to pay rent, but I have no idea where I\u2019m headed or what I\u2019m doing",

She tells me that It\u2019s not worth taking a questionnaire until my life isn\u2019t stressful (for context, my life is busy enough most days don\u2019t fit on a planner and I feel like crying half the time from stress) and also I can\u2019t have it because my grades stay high.

    "text": "18M.\n\nTL;DR - After 4 years of relative improvement, my suicidal thoughts have returned.\n\n...I don't know where to start. This year has been horrible, and it's not even 1/4 over. Maybe some context.\n\nI slid into a deep depression in 2016. When paired with the crippling anxiety I've always had (yay autism), I was a trainwreck. By 2018, things had gotten so bad that I constantly thought about taking my own life. And in the Summer of 2018, I attempted suicide twice.\n\nAfter a week in a mental hospital and some medication changes, I slowly started to feel better. My depression started to lift, and although my anxiety didn't change much, I was able to keep it somewhat under control. By the time 2020 rolled around, I thought I was almost out of the woods.\n\nThen came the Pandemic. And I got even better.\n\nI don't know why, but 2020 (despite being called the \"worst year ever\" at the time) was the best year for my mental health in nearly 5 years. Maybe it's because everyone else was as miserable as I had been, maybe it's because I finally had a good excuse to stay inside and not deal with people, but 2020 was almost refreshing.\n\nIn 2021, though, it was back to business as usual. I wasn't as bad as I was in 2018 (or 2019, for that matter), but I still felt noticeably worse than I did in 2020.\n\nBut holy shit, this year, my mental health has taken a nosedive.\n\nMy grandmother died in January, and I didn't know what to feel. Our relationship wasn't as simple as my relationship with my late grandfather (whom I genuinely hated), so I felt... confused. My dad started bickering with my uncle about what to do with her house, and I don't know whose side to take. My uncle's been making a lot of mistakes, but at the same time, my dad's being extremely hard to work with. So dealing with that was... not fun.\n\nIn February, I debated if I should confess to my crush. We're very close friends, and she's been extremely kind and helpful to me over the years. I decided against telling her, not because I'm scared of rejection, but because I don't want to lose her. She'd be my first girlfriend, and from what I've seen, first relationships always end badly. And I treasure her friendship more than most things in life. So that was draining.\n\nAnd then World War 3 started, and so did the suicidal thoughts.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. Should I tell my psychiatrist and have him give me more pills? Should I go to an expensive therapist and learn generic coping skills I'll never use? Should I kill myself? Should I just wait in peace for the bombs to fall? Should I head back to the mental hospital in the middle of a Pandemic?\n\n...ugh. Sorry if you read all that.",

    "text": "My biological father abandoned my mother when I was a kid and our family struggled to make ends meet for awhile until my mother met my stepdad and had 2 more kids. Making me the eldest of 6 children. My biological father leaving really affected my mental health most of my childhood until now when we\u2019ve started reconnecting. I\u2019m a 21M btw. Well my little brother suffered the most from my father leaving bc he didn\u2019t get along with my stepdad and they often argued or even fought ( which I had to break up by pinning my stepdad into a corner). My brother was a bit of a rebel partly due to my father being gone and my mother simply not having enough time to raise him properly as she had 5 other children to tend to on top of working 12 hr shifts. And my biological father was never around to support us. This left me to take on the parental role to all of my siblings but especially my little brother bc I know how hard it is growing up fatherless and trying to find yourself. Also I made sure to try and keep him outta trouble and look over him like he was my son. The problem arose when he moved with my father for a bit bc of a fight with my stepdad. Him living with my father for a year is when his behavior took a turn for the worst and when he moved back he was on a downward spiral. During this time I also have basically been staying with my girlfriend and her family over the pandemic. I feel ashamed and like a failure due to my inability to help him out more with his life and I struggle with not feeling adequate. I feel as he is my responsibility bc my parents really failed him and just gave up imo. He\u2019s a bright kid and is far from dumb but he didn\u2019t have a healthy environment to cultivate the genius in him and I feel as if I could get my own place and help him his life will be 10x better. I\u2019m graduating from community college this summer with my degree and I feel good about my accomplishment but I just can\u2019t shake this feeling of guilt, shame, and despair over this situation with my brother. And I\u2019m scared about the trajectory he\u2019s going down and if I\u2019m not able to help before he\u2019s in jail or worse.",

I'm overweight and trying to shape up with a work ethic of next to nothing no motivational drive.   \n\n\nNothing. Its what I am and what I can do. Nothing at all. I feel helpless constantly from both my own situation and my grandmothers failing health. My only joys being painting and gaming. Which is the only thing I do for the majority of the day I.. I'm worthless.. I cant even write like how I want cause I'm to much of a spaztic unmotivated idiot.  \n\n\nThrough Various means and other things I have fucked my life in many small and large ways to such a point I don't feel I can do anything about it. My anxiety at such a point that Thinking about my future and how to fix it can cause severe panic attacks. I stay at my grandmothers as much as I can as since December I have had no room at my house with my mother. Her storage unit having been not paid for a while so we go get everything from it and it is thus placed into my room.  I have begged her for months to fix it to no avail.  \n\n\nI have been with my grandmother for the majority of my time for the past 5 or so months before that both for her past mentioned failing health as well as my awful sister. She and her partner had a falling out so her and both her kids came to hour house. Completely took over the basement and the area I called home. Trashed it and made it an utter disaster and it has stayed that way for months. She sees that my room has had stuff put in it from my mom and put her own things in it to just fuck things up more.   \n\n\nI'm.. I'm helpless to do anything I. I don't know what to do anymore. It terrifies me that ill stay this way for the next 5 years. That everything I'll do is in utter vain. All for nothing. My life just feels.. over. It is my greatest fear that ill never be anything more than the failure I am currently in one form or another. But I simply lack the drive and work ethic to help myself. so much has just led me into this.. Learned helplessness I guess for a lack of a better term.   \n\n\nIll look at the situation and my mind will just. reject it out of laziness or mild anxiety or any number of other reasons. Causing me to feel worse about myself as nothing changes causing me to blame myself and spiral further down into depression from there. Some days I'm perfectly fine. Others I curl up in bed and wont leave it for hours on end Cuddling a pillow for some form of comfort.   \n\n\nI.. I don't know what to do anymore.

    "text": "I've put myself down, lied to myself to try and make myself feel worse, and finally when I started opening up to people I told them too much. And instead of listening to them and trying their advice out, I kept thinking the bad things I was thinking about myself.\n\nWhen the one person in the group I cared for the most out of the group approached me about it, I got upset. I had already been upset because I had seen someone that I cared about upset, aaand I was also upset that I still cared about her, when I thought I was over her. I am over her, tho, just don't like seeing her upset. She doesn't know. She has a boyfriend.\n\nAnyways, when the person from the group approached me, I let out all my anger and bitterness out onto her, and I didn't stop. I felt like I had messed up once again and I was afraid that they weren't going to give me a second chance. Once she told me to stfu, I finally did, realized what I had done and immediately regretted everything. In my rant I had actively tried to make her hate me as much as I did myself. I don't know if I succeeded.\n\nI know that at one point, the girl from the group did feel a certain way about me, and I her. Then she said she couldn't feel that way about me. Yet, she still said and did things that made me and a friend that I trusted and told think that she was still into me. But after what I did, I don't know if she'll forgive me.\n\nI think. I think eventually. Eventually she will, if she hasn't already. Eventually the entire group might. I have tried to apologize to the entire group. It went... Well, most were quiet. The only one that spoke was the one who told me that she wasn't scared of me. She said that after some time and reevaluating of myself, I might be able to come back.\n\nThat's better than what I was expecting. Almost the opposite. I had thought the girl who didn't really like me (the girl who does's best friend essentially) would've told me to jump off a bridge and I would have. So. Better than expected.\n\nI just need to know what to do now. None of you may have the answer. You might. But right now, I'm going to stop hating myself so that I can love the people I care about.",

I would do embarrassing things without realizing it.  \n\n\nI quit taking the meds for years before i was the age of 25. These same meds i listed I also took throughout my life.   \n\n\nI had a lot of friends and it seemed like people were accepting me for who I was.\n\nI never had reactions like what im about to list\n\nWhen I was in jail I would notice this guy who was shaking his hips constantly he was a heavy meth user. I was also a meth user in my past and when I took the same medications as him I would do the same thing.   \n\n\nWhen I was out of jail I was prescribed latuda. I would have very severe side effects like my entire body tensing up and my jaw wouldn't close. I had to go to the hospital for Ativan.   \n   \nDuring this time I wouldn't  take my meds, they had me on medications like depakote which didnt feel like it did anything. I stopped taking the meds and ultimately didnt notice anything.   \n\n\nSo I was put on seroquel and the seroquel seemed to be doing just fine. I had my life back and it seemed like everything was going well until my doctor adjusted my meds from 100 to 150 mg, I started having very severe side effects. I wouldn't stop doing really dumb things and I would constantly do stuff that made my friends and family hate me. I had no control anymore over my actions. when I told my psychiatrist about this he decided to up my meds from 150 - 200 mg and i started having really bad panic attacks and couldn't control anything anymore.   \n\n\nI then decided to quit my meds a week ago and after my withdrawal it seems my life is back to normal. It was like something was lifted off of me that was stifling everything that was essentially \"life\". being able to feel emotions and feeling excited for the first time in years.",

They\u2019re aware, but there\u2019s times where I just feel like a broken record where the sky is always falling. However; I\u2019ve found that reading through old Reddit posts about people having these experiences too helps.\n\nAs some background, when I was a young kid I got in a really bad four wheeling accident that left me stranded alone in the woods for hours; No one knew where I was. I was diagnosed with PTSD, although I think I was too young to understand the implications.\n\nIt feels like every day I wake up and go to war with my own mind. I have vivid imaginations of my own Demise on a near daily basis; from what I can see now there is no end.\n\nThere are times i feel so doomed that I\u2019m not worrying so much about dying but more what the best way to go is.\n\nEvery time I say goodbye to my friends and parents I cry because I feel like it\u2019s actually the last time I\u2019ll see them. I want them to know how important they are to me.\n\nI was at a concert earlier today and I had to find a bathroom stall where I could just sit and cry in peace while listening to what feels like my last concert ever. \n\nI\u2019m dealing with thoughts about existence. What are we really here to do in this world? If I were to perish tomorrow what would I look back upon that would justify my existence? Sometimes I\u2019m scared that I don\u2019t have a good answer.\n\n I\u2019m dealing with thoughts of my parents passing away and my inability to cope with it.

I\u2019m currently on anti anxiety meds and that makes me worry too because now it feels like I\u2019m running out of options. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever hurt myself though, I\u2019m way too scared of dying.\n\nThis just doesn\u2019t seem like something that can be solved with medications alone. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if any others have these thoughts too, and if there\u2019s even a way out.",

    "text": "This is just a rant for myself and i don\u2019t know how to word it. I know I am able to control parts of my life, I can control the way I think about myself and other people. It\u2019s just difficult when you constantly cycle through every possible nuance and situation and change your opinion on everything every 5 seconds. It\u2019s difficult to explain how I think because it\u2019s definitely not linear. Well, first off I don\u2019t like myself. I feel weak when I think this way since I really have no real reason or excuse to think like this. I feel pathetic because this type of thinking strays me away from friends, family and from doing homework properly. I feel like I\u2019m constantly being judged, thinking i\u2019m doing something wrong, or feel like I don\u2019t deserve them, or they don\u2019t deserve someone like me, or I\u2019m just annoying them they would\u2019nt possibly want to actually talk to me\u2026I want to stay home and be alone since I\u2019m usually more comfortable that way. But then I get the sudden burst of wanting to talk to everyone and everybody I meet for a week straight feeling this sense of euphoria and doing things that I love again. But then I come down from it right after and want to just hide in a hole and not exist. I wish I could live in that state of mind forever because I feel like I\u2019m not living up to my potential at all. I know this mindset is unhealthy and toxic. But it\u2019s difficult to break out of. This cycle is exhausting and I don\u2019t know what I actually think. \n\nI feel stupid whenever I don\u2019t know something and feel bad that I don\u2019t. I feel envious of others and I hate this feeling. I\u2019m never good enough in my mind this is why I have no confidence or self esteem whatsoever. But then during those highs I feel like confident and assured of myself\u2026.but then it ends up dying again. I feel weak. I hate that my emotions control me so much. I have a weak mind. I thought I was better than this. \n\nIt didn\u2019t used to be like this before. I used to trust everyone and considered everyone I talked to my close friend. Now, it\u2019s hard to feel that \u201creal\u201d connection with anybody now. Maybe its due to pandemic. Maybe its due to my close friend blocking me for some reason. But the thing is, I\u2019ve always had this type of thinking before too. It just\u2026didn\u2019t affect my outside life as much. I never really talked to people about how I thought since I didn\u2019t want to trouble them. But now, I get every opportunity to talk about it and it just makes me feel worse. I feel like I\u2019m just seeking attention now. I want to be someone that people rely on. I want to have close friends that I can talk to about anything. Sorry this post is so long and probably didn\u2019t make much sense at all. This is usually how I talk to my friends about it and they don\u2019t really understand. I\u2019m finally going to see a therapist hopefully by the end of the month. I really really do want to get better. Thanks for reading all of this if you did &lt;3 hope you have a great day.",

    "text": "(F, 15) if that matters \n\n\nI'm sorry this is long, I just want to make sure I have any possibly important information and also to vent about the situation considering I've told two people and I wasn't able to properly explain it.\n\n(Background)\nI've struggled with paranoia probably at least since last year (I'm not entirely sure I have a shit memory) regarding people being in my home/room/closet/under my bed, pretty much anywhere I cannot see.\n It doesn't really happen everyday and its not bad. I'm pretty good at ignoring it and distracting myself from it or sometimes I will just check under my bed so the paranoia will go away. I sometimes have to check multiple times because if I am not actively seeing the area which the paranoia is coming from Ill still sometimes think someone could be there even though it doesn't make much sense (this usually only happens with the under my bed part, I think bc the possible danger is closer to me.) In those cases I'll keep reassuring myself that there's no way someone could be there if I just checked. This also hasn't really been prevelant when I was younger, and right after my sister started going to her bf's house for the night more often (she's the only other person who lives in our pretty small basement) it was bad for a couple of nights. One night I grabbed a weight and kept it next to me so if anyone came in my room I would have a weapon. I did get used to this when she moved out and didn't experience the paranoia as strongly, I also felt little fear most of the time. I also dont/haven't really wanted to clean my room not just because I'm lazy but also so I'll feel more reassured that my floor is essentially boobytrapped.\n\n(Now onto what I'm worried about)\nThis all starts with me finishing a videogame, it's called \"The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\" for anyone wondering and I think it's important to preface that this game does have a creepy vibe to it and I always felt that while I was walking around that someone could be right behind me in the game and carried some minor paranoia around while playing (but considering I had a lot of prior knowledge on the game I knew this wasn't the case.) But this did all happen after I finished the game, and maybe being a little more emotionally vulnerable seeing the ending of the game contributed to this (maybe plus the paranoia I already was experiencing while playing the game) but after I finished it and I had no music or anything on and was on my phone researching about the game (I don't remember very well how exactly it started) but I do remember being In the silent room at night and I started feeling this building paranoia and fear. (Usually when I have paranoia it doesn't come with fear unless I feed Into it but this time it was already there) I started looking towards my closet and my door and stood up in the middle of the room pretty much frozen and had to build up the courage to fully close my door, the fear was consuming but after I did that I felt some relief and continued to just stand in the middle of my room, sitting down in my chair felt to vulnerable and I started thinking about how someone could be under my bed so to see the blindspot I sat against my dresser so I could be directly facing the bed and easily able to see both my closet and the door to my room, but the fear just kept getting worse and I had a small panic attack and noticing the other two slight blindspots on the left and right sides of the dresser I started getting more scared and then I had the horrific thought that someone could be in my dresser drawer because it's large enough, I still remember the fear that went through my body when I realized that, so I just stood in the very center of my room because I was terrified. I was able though to slowly calm myself down though, remind myself to breath, and I started to distract myself with my phone and the fear started to fade away and I was fine for the rest of the night. What does this mean?? The fear and paranoia probably lasted at least 10-15 minutes.\n\nI've never felt so much fear in my life, and the rationalizing I always used to do couldn't combat the emotion I was feeling. Thankfully In this situation knowing that I would be able to hear them if there really was someone in my house really helped me.\n\n I was also trying to get as much information as possible because I'm not sure if this was purely caused from maybe playing a scary game and it's nothing to worry about or if it was a delusion I might have been experiencing. It also may be more concerning considering my sister (who does smoke idk if this can influence things) told me that she has experienced some aduitory hallucinations with some that you definitely cannot rationalize. Shes also 21, so I know were both in the typical age range for developing schizophrenia and it can be passed genetically. I'm definitely more worried about her but I just want an outside opinion if I should maybe talk to my parents about this and see if we might have a gene that runs in the family.\n\nAlso sorry about the recounting of the events the only thing I remember clearly is just the fear so I tried to recount it the best I could.",

I couldn\u2019t complain - it was the bed of my own making after all. But it has been 5 years. And I have cried no less than 1000 times. And yes I cheated and I deserved to feel bad but I feel like I\u2019m serving a life sentence. \n\nI was 26 and I had been in 3 long term relationships and never cheated. I met and dated Mary for close to 6 months  and I went off to grad school - and that\u2019s where I cheated on the person that deserved it the least. Eventually I came to my senses and decided to do right by her, so I let her go, broke-up with her, and cut off the \u201cother girl\u201d. At first it felt like a normal breakup, but then everything slowly crumbled. I descended into a depression as I agonized and ruminated over I hurt and betrayed this girl, someone I knew would never do the same to me. I would randomly cry thinking about how shocked she must\u2019ve been, how hurt she must have felt, sometimes crying 10-20 times a day. Sure all of this is expected at first  but these feelings went on and on unwavering, unabated, and only getting worse. \n\nFast forward 5 years later, after months of therapy, a year of being on antidepressants I still flash back to her crying. I still agonize over the little things that I should have said or did wrong in the relationship. And most of all I still literally cry over the fact that 6 months into the relationship, she had already said I love you and I was just starting to flirt with saying it - but never did. \n\nMy therapist helped me conclude that I have an almost obsessive and persistent sense of guilt but I still don\u2019t know how to fix it and it has taken over my life. \n\nI even feel guilty because I feel guilty - because I recognize that it was ME that hurt her and I was just dealing with the natural consequences. Society really crucifies cheaters and I have internalized all of the those things you always hear like \u201conce a cheater always a cheater, if he cheated he never loved you, he never deserved you\u201d and just that general fuck you, youre shit attitude etc. i get it, all sympathy deservedly goes to the victim but when do I get to heal?

These morning have made it almost impossible for me to go to school so I\u2019ve stayed home a lot.\n\nMy mom wants to come into the school with me and talk to the principle about my missed days but I\u2019m afraid they will look at my grades and I\u2019ll be judged and yelled at. I\u2019ve e honestly been falling behind in classes because these days I only feel slightly okay when I\u2019m distracting myself with things like games or running. I tried to do homework on of of my bad days but I couldn\u2019t I just felt so unmotivated and stressed out. This feeling makes me feel almost empty or trapped it may sound weird but it feels like I\u2019m drowning but mentally. \n\nOne of the biggest things stopping me from wanting to go back or just making my stress worse are the comments from my classmates whenever I\u2019m there now. So many comments saying \u201cwhy are you here\u201d or \u201che\u2019s literally never here\u201d and it always happens first thing in the morning when I step into my first class. I feel like the teachers hate me because I\u2019ve missed so many classes and have to ask if I can postpone my tests to come in later. My partner tries to help me and I feel bad when I don\u2019t feel like their advice is useful or helps me in anyway. Whenever I talk to my step dad it usually sums up to \u201clife sucks so take it like a man and push through\u201d and my mom usually just branches off and only talks about her job and her experiences. \n\nI\u2019m so tired but I am both unable to sleep and very scared to sleep. The feeling of dread every morning I wake up when there\u2019s school close by it just is one of the worst feeling I\u2019ve experienced. My mom finally decided to send me to school \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if you are throwing up or dying\u201d I\u2019m honestly lucky to have missed so many days and I\u2019m not surprised by her decision but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. I have this feeling like everything will be so much better if I just go to a different school or move to a different state and restart. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThis was longer than I had expected",

I take a knife and drag it down my arm, my leg, my shoulder. Usually not enough to bleed, but it scratches and stays for days. \n\nWhen work gets too stressful and the people just won't stop, I dig my nails into my palms. I scratch my arms. I scratch the back of my neck until it stings. \n\nWhen it's really bad I find a sharper blade. And I see how much I can take, until all that there is in that moment is the pain I'm enduring. Because it's better than the pain I cant see. \n\nIts never dangerous, at least it wasn't. Now I'm scared it's moved from just sad emotions. Before it would be maybe I would get mad, I would dig my nails into my head or pound on my legs. But then I took a knife I thought was dull and pulled it across my arm 6 times. Quickly, no thought other than the anger and the release I wanted. But it didn't help. I watched the blood that used to comfort me well up, and I cried. I had done something terrible, and terrifying. \n\nIm so scared. I don't think I'll do it out of anger again. But I can't even stop these small things- twisting my skin too far, hitting my legs, dragging my sharp nails on my skin, reaching for that knife. \n\nI don't know how to cope. I can't cope with the feelings I'm feeling now. I'm so scared. I'm so sad. I'm so lonely, and lost. I want professional help, but I live in America. We don't have the money. Everything costs too much, and even now I feel like my problems aren't worth it. \n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to die. I'm too young to die from some stupid mistake I'll never be able to undo. But I don't know how to prevent it. I don't know how to cope. What do you do when the person you love most is the one person you can't talk to? I don't know what to do. I cant handle all that there is to this horrible life and the world we live in. I can feel myself slipping further into the hole I thought I climbed out of a long time ago, but it doesn't go away. It'll never go away will it? \n\nAnd this urge, the urge to feel something that I can be in complete control of. This urge to punish myself for the bullshit of the outside world. Will that ever go away? Am I going to die because I'll never have someone that can really help me?",

    "text": "About 6 years ago, I was devastated by someone I loved. She walked away, at a moments notice, and told me \"no one wants a man who cries and has depression.\" So I stopped crying.\n\nNow I lay awake every night, thinking about all the people I push away or I say mean things to, because I'm terrified the second I tell them I care about them or I love them, they'll walk away. But now, I *can't* cry. \n\nGoing on dates scares me and I usually end up breaking things off immediately, because I'm scared to get hurt again. I'm scared they might actually like me, and that I might develop feelings, and that they might walk away like my ex did. But I still can't cry.\n\nI made a new friend online, super nice sweet and kindhearted. And what do I do? I torment them. I say mean things, I push them away, I got drunk and told them I love them and then in the morning told them it was a drunk text and I lie when I drink (I don't. I'm actually most open when I've been drinking). I push so hard that I actually think I might have caused them mental and emotional pain, and oh my fucking God do I feel like shit for it. And every time I try to apologize, I can't find the words. It's like \"I'm sorry im a piece of shit, you dont deserve to be treated like this\" doesn't exist in my vocabulary. And it hurts. I'm sure it hurts them way more. But I still can't cry.\n\nWhen COVID started, I got laid off for 6 months. Which was fine, the unemployment more than took care of things and I was actually getting more than I made at my job. But, I had time to sit and think. And started to realize I was in a state of pure depression/depersonalization (sometimes, usually just depressed). I realized that for all the friends I've made over the years, whenever I really needed just something as small as a hug, I had no one. And it hurt. Still now, I can't even get a simple hug and a \"it'll be alright\". And I still can't cry.\n\nAll I want is to be held and told everything will be OK, and be able to cry and let it all out. I want to be able to open myself back up and accept the depression and all the pain I've endured, whether for myself or for others (being strong for those who can't be takes a toll eventually). I want to bawl my fucking eyes out so I can feel a little bit better again.\n\nBut instead, I just can't cry.\n\nSide note: I'm not suicidal and I do see a therapist. Therapy doesn't really help all that much tbh, it's just a bit of an outlet. I really just needed to vent somewhere tonight.",

    "text": "Last night I found out that my partner of 3 years had been cheating on me for 2 of those years.  We were long distance so I guess that\u2019s why it took me so long to find out.  And even with that, I only found out because they\u2019re \u201creal life\u201d girlfriend told me.\n\nObviously I broke up with them after I found out what happened, but I feel so, just like, used and violated by them.\n\nI sent them nudes and we sexted and they were probably sleeping with other girls at the same time or around the same time-frame.  I feel so dirty.\n\nLike, I don\u2019t blame myself for what they did, but I keep getting stuck in this thought loop of \u201chow could someone be so horrible and do something like that to someone they claimed to love?\u201d\n\nIt really fucks me up cause the whole time we were together they acted like I was the only one for them and they always said how much they loved me and appreciated me and all this shit, but during that time they were literally cheating on me.\n\nThey did a lot of other toxic, manipulative shit too during the relationship, such as threatening self-harm/suicide whenever we got into big arguments and they thought I was gonna break up with them.\n\nI feel like I have so much, like, legitimate trauma from what they put me through.  And I tried to ignore it for so long cause I thought (foolishly) that they would get better (they claimed to have mental health issues that made them act the way they did), but clearly that never happened.\n\nAnd now that the relationship is over I don\u2019t know how to process everything I just learned literally only 24 hours ago.\n\nI wasted almost 3 whole years of my life on them.  They were my first real relationship, or at least what I thought was a real relationship (clearly it wasn\u2019t for them).  We started dating when I was 17 and they were 16, so since I had nothing to compare the relationship to at the time, I think I missed a lot of the red flags and whatnot.\n\nI wish I would\u2019ve ended things sooner, but I was just so afraid of what might happen if I did.  I stayed because I felt obligated and also because I genuinely thought we\u2019d get married someday.  Like, I told them so many times I wanted to marry them someday and they were always like \u201cme too\u201d and \u201cof course I wanna marry you\u201d while they were actively fucking other girls.\n\nIt literally makes me feel sick thinking about them.\n\nPlus apparently they were cheating on me with a 16 yr old (when they\u2019re 19), so that\u2019s just straight up illegal.\n\nI want to move on from this break up and I\u2019ve tried to delete anything on my phone that reminds me of them (plus I of course blocked their number and Snap and stuff), but I just\u2026 idk\u2026 I literally told them like all my deepest secrets and shit and I trusted them.  I considered them my best friend.\n\nThey literally betrayed me.\n\nAnd when I confronted them about it last night it seemed like they barely even cared.  Like they admitted to cheating, but barely even gave me a half-hearted apology for it.\n\nThis whole situation has just fucked up my mental health so much and I don\u2019t know what to do now.  I know I need time to heal from the break up, but does anyone have any suggestions for what might help?\n\nI\u2019ve talked about it with a close friend of mine, so that\u2019s helped a little.\n\nI just don\u2019t wanna keep feeling the way I do now, which is physically nauseous.  Like I already deal with anxiety anyway, so this whole thing has not helped with that at all.\n\nI just wanna feel okay again.",

I also tend to work difficult jobs that require a lot from me mentally, emotionally and physically. Currently I work with children in a school district as a senior behavior technician (essentially). I\u2019ve been in this position for 3 years (also the longest I\u2019ve stayed at one job). Anywho, a great portion of my job is dealing with kids that are having a difficult time.

Nobody understands that \"just keep going! \" \"you can do it!\" \"It's up to you to make things better for yourself! \" I get that but it's so, so hard I've been trying, I've been trying for years but I still haven't gotten anywhere. I can't afford therapy.\n My titamama is miserable. It's all of her own doing but it's hard to watch. \nMy mom is destroying her body from over working. She's in so much physical pain. But she can't afford the surgery to help her. It's all my dad's fault. \nHe doesn't care if we're all hurting as long as he gets to steal money from my mom then everything is all good.\nI'm worried about my little brother. He doesn't show it but I know nothing is easy for him either. There's so many things he wanted to do and should have gotten to do but my dad gave so many empty promises and always does what he can to either avoid helping or to get kick my brother when he's high.\nI'm also worried about my baby brother. School is so hard on him. He feels like he's being cornered and that everyone is against him. I'm scared he'll end up like titamama. \nWhat got me to writing this was a few hours ago. I had made a post it didn't get very much attention but in case it did, I was talking to myself about what I was going to say. Then I started to cry. I cried because I finally said what I've been wanting to say. I was kind like my own therapist. Even tho I always knew why things were so hard. I live in Mississippi America.",

    "text": "I was in a car crash where I shouldn\u2019t have survived about a month ago due to an oil spill where I lost total control of my car. Since then I\u2019ve planned to rebuild that car as a hobby and got a second one to drive in the meantime. Unfortunately since I\u2019ve started to drive again this past week since I\u2019ve recovered from my injuries I have this terrible feeling that my car is swaying all over the road even though it isn\u2019t (My dad is a mechanic and does the maintenance on my car &amp; drives it to test etc when I\u2019m concerned). I have dreams when I\u2019m drifting off to sleep like I\u2019m falling but it\u2019s the car swerving in the accident and then I get jolted awake right before the impact. Does anyone have any advice for mentally recovering from such a bad accident? I\u2019ve had some severe issues with depression and psychosis in the past which I am managing well at the moment, but there\u2019s nothing I love more in the world than driving and it\u2019s so upsetting and stressful to me that I can\u2019t get enjoyment out of it anymore and I\u2019m scared it will ruin my progress. I\u2019ve read articles saying take it slow etc but not being able to physically bring myself to drive over 40mph is really bothering me and limiting my independence. I don\u2019t think the problem is the road or the car anymore I think there\u2019s something wrong with my head reliving this crash every day",

    "text": "(Tw: sexual stuff, miscarriages)\n\nI didn't really know what to title this nor do I really know what I'm talking about because I'm just mentally flooding and overloaded at the moment, but I don't really know where else to post or ask this. \n\nQuick background: I have complex ptsd, have had a lot of trauma surrounding sexual situations, and have also had so many miscarriages that it's ridiculous. There's more along with those issues, but those are what's relevant to this specific post.\n\nI had a therapist but have been unable to afford therapy for about a year now due to having tons of medical bills thanks to rapidly declining physical health, so that's a thing, too.\n\nAnyway... my ex spouse and I split up a few years ago and with how close we were, I really haven't had any interest in anyone because it just seems pointless since no one will ever compare to how we were together. I've accepted this. We still speak on friendly terms occasionally, but we both live in different cities now. No badness or problems, but previous interference in our relationship and marriage from INSANELY horrible family members combined with us losing multiple children thanks to my health = everything ended. (That's the long story short.) I have never before or since been so madly in love with someone and so deeply connected. However, the universe hates us and wrecks it every time. (We've been trying to. Ale it work since high school and we're now both in our 30s.) I've had a few flings since our divorce with very physically attractive (to me) individuals and was very pleased with those interactions aside from dealing with the physical pain that comes along with intercourse for me. (I have endometriosis and will be having it removed AGAIN in a few weeks plus getting a hysterectomy since all of my organs are just having a bad time in general.) Never any mental closeness though, so that's always lacking. In general, sexy time is just problematic in one way or another for me. Been pretty normal for decades now. I usually don't have it phase me, enjoy what I can, the end. Moving on.\n\nCut to the present, and I'm having horrible thirst for fictional characters from movies because why not (safe/fictional/totally hot), so reading some smut for kicks just seems like a great idea when I can't sleep. Great times for the imagination, happy brain, but no bothering with physical mess because again, arousal or doing anything about it just leads to pain. Really hoping this resolves after the \"final\" surgery. Literally just reading and enjoying the mental images tonight when the flood gates burst open.\n\nAnyway, I'm down for breeding kinks all the way, but it's making my head so scrambled right now that I'm now just... I don't know. I usually like it, but I'm having a mix of getting triggered and crying because I feel like I'll never experience that true closeness with anyone in the same way ever again (never have before or since my ex spouse no matter how many partners I've had---and also that \"almost nearly making a baby\" deal is incredibly scary and vulnerable and can often lead to that close attachment feeling and the risk is about to be permanently gone for me), AND also I'm having this crushing fear that losing my reproductive organs is going to make me so unappealing and disgusting that I'll never be suitable for human contact again. Cant really have fun with a breeding kink if I can't can't breed anymore. I mean, technically I'm done having kids and REALLY don't want anymore, and it so would make life far easier with no periods and fluctuations, no pregnancy risks, and just overall would make things a lot more awesome because there's no fear of more pregnancies and more losses. But also I feel like if I ever have any male partners after this surgery, things won't work right on the inside, nothing will be the same, I'll just be disgusting and fake and missing what I need to be to be... me, I guess. Because it's defined who I am for so long. Which is weird to say, but I think that's part of the problem? That i feel defined by my pregnancies and losses and constant ability to screw up and ALWAYS make more babies but also have them die not long after I discover they're growing inside of me? Hyperfertility is a bitch. Seriously. And feeling like an unintentional murderer just because my organs keep creating and deleting unviable offspring for decades is just a whole other deal to unpack, but that's not what I'm here to talk about at the moment. (For those who say I need to just use birth control and resolve the problem, I've done that off and on for quite a while. Currently on nothing due to being inactive and also about to get sterilized af. Other than two pregnancies, the rest were created in committed relationships when a viable child would have been fantastic to bring into the relationship. It's not a cycle of self-inflicted foolishness, if that's what you're thinking.)\n\nI'm also thinking maybe I'm subconsciously freaking out because I'll never be able to have children ever again too. Which is good because only 2 out of my 10+ pregnancies have made it and I'm too sickly and exhausted to ever make more, plus aging is rough, but I feel like losing my organs should reduce the trauma levels because I'll know I can never relive those experiences again. I'll also never cramp, feel the same pains, feel cervical pain (the worst), or bleed and have the trauma of childloss thrown in my face month after month after month like usual. My current mental health is incredibly poor, but I can't die no matter what I've tried, so I just keep on pushing forward and carrying on despite that. Gotta do the whole mom thing, and I also have a lot of really great pets to care for too, so I can't let my cptsd take me away from my kids nor furry and scaley babies. However, constantly having spontaneous pains from hell and tons of bleeding is the most triggering crap on the planet, and it makes it so hard to function.\n\nI don't know what the exact point of this post is. I got on the internet to find smutty romance fanfiction and instead am having some wild midlife uterine crisis or something. I guess any advice or input would be great because I can't sort my own thoughts and feelings at the moment but am feeling quite confused, conflicted, and distressed. I don't know if I'm scared of surgery (even though i REALLY need it and want it) or if I'm struggling with relationship issues or what. Idk. It feels like a mix of never being close to the love of my life again (at least for a while--I try to be hopeful things will one day get back to being okay even if it takes us until we're 80 to work it out---it's been a thing for 14+ years already) combined with whatever tf I just typed above regarding the organ/baby situations.\n\nI don't know.

    "text": "So I have this friend that I've know since secondary school who may been living in delusion, quite possibly for several years. Only pieced it together yesterday after my cousin found it strange and did some digging. Story time.\n\nGoing to call my friend D and the guys in this as story John, Bill and Greg. \n\nSo back around 2017, I remembered wanting to reconnect with old friends. Found D on Facebook and we started talking. D tells me that she's been going out with this guy and that they've known each other since she was 14. His name was John. John worked as a martial arts instructor at a gym. He was also a cancer survivor currently in remission. Anyway, they have all sorts of celebrations, especially on valentines day. I've always wondered about the strong filters D always used on the photos. More to that later.\n\nSo suddenly, John and D break up. John drinks and takes drugs excessively and shares some of the photos he took at the club with me. The photos look staged. John and D get back together. John suddenly goes back home to the states and he decides to do legal euthanasia.\n\nD is heartbroken and meets Bill. He is about 30 or 40 years her senior. They are happy for awhile until D finds that he hadn't been honest with her(Bill was trying to quit smoking, she found the cigarettes). She claimed Bill hit her. She wants to come home.\n\nShe comes home and gets together with John's best friend, Greg, who has had a thing with D since they dated when D broke up with John. They get married and post mushy stories on Facebook. \n\nI've always found it odd that John, Greg and D all type the same way when they chat with me. John is American and Greg is British and I'm pretty sure they pride themselves with a better command of English than bad grammar and broken texts. Also I and a few other people constantly get tagged to all their posts. \n\nIt is now 2022 and I'm almost convinced almost everyone I've  said so far is fake. Greg is actually a gay British actor with a loving husband and two children. Every single photo of them(D and 'Greg') together has been weirdly cropped and a funky filter placed on top of it. Every time I ask to go out with them, she always has a reason to why they can't meet.\n\nOut of all the guys I mentioned, I think Bill was the only real one. I mean all of us knew she went overseas and according to another friend, her Instagram suddenly lit up one day after being so quiet.\n\nI am now seriously worried for her. I believe John and Greg are fake and she's living in a delusion probably way before I reconnected with her.\n\nHow can I go about with this without chasing her away?",

    "text": "I have always been a pretty extroverted person for the most part of my life. Right from when I was 11-12 years old, I was the only one among my peers to have friends from different age groups, and the older I got, the major part of my friend circle consisted of seniors or even older people. I have been into extracurriculars from a pretty young age, doing stuff like MUNs, debates, elocution, quizzes, writing stuff and all of that, and it was often that I was the youngest person in the room. I also have done academically really well for the most part. I think it all made me feel like I was growing up a bit faster than most of my peers, and while constantly being in competition with people older than me or more qualified than me definitely was a great learning and confidence-building experience, I don't really know where it all went wrong, because by the time I was 16, I felt kind of damaged and really burnt out. \n\n\nI don't really understand what happened, but the more I think about it, I feel like nothing really did. I have always felt this way and I think I am coming to terms with that fact. For the past two years, during the pandemic, I was allowed to sit with those feelings and I realised that my knees still shake when I am on stage, the way they did 7-8 years ago. My voice still quivers slightly when I speak, I still feel all the nerves even though I feel like I should be used to that by now. I feel nervous making even the simplest of conversation nowadays, like I have to overthink every word I say, even to people I should be able to trust. After hanging out with my friends I end up thinking secretly that they don't really like me even though I have absolutely no reason to believe so. I still go for debates and stuff, or rather, my mentors and teachers and parents push me for it and even though I do openly express that I don't feel confident or I don't feel ready, they just go like \"You've done this your whole life, you'll ace it\". I do end up \"acing\" it, for the most part, but I can't make them understand just how anxiety-inducing the whole event ends up being for me, it reduces me to a nervous wreck, and people around me don't wanna believe that because \"you look perfectly fine though, what's wrong?\"\n\n\nMy friends and peers are the same, I don't think they fully understand or believe me when I try to tell them about how I really feel, or how nerve-wracking everyday simple things are for me. \"But you're so confident, so outgoing! You're just overthinking stuff, don't worry\" I am sick and tired of hearing this. I know I'm overthinking stuff, and knowing that doesn't help. It feels like the me that people around me know, and the me that I know are two different people. I don't really feel like the person they tell me I am. I am so tired of not feeling okay, and so tired of everyone telling me I'm perfectly fine when I feel far, far from fine.\n\n\nI want to feel like this person everyone around me seems to think I am. I do not want to be this nervous, anxious, overanalyzing, overthinking mess inside. I am so grateful that I have a good home, a good upbringing, and so much of other good things that so many people are deprived of. I do not, not for a second, believe that my problems are the most important ones in the world and I understand and sympathise with so many other people in this world who have so so difficult lives. But that doesn't really make mine easy. I feel like I'm constantly crumbling inside, I have been crumbling inside for the past two/three years, and no one believes it because I don't look the fucking part. \n\n\nI could do with some advice. About what I should do. If I can do something. I have tried therapy, and I just wanna say that therapy is not for me. It just hurts more. I makes me feel even more broken. So if anyone, who has felt something similar, or can suggest me something, please do.",

    "text": "To start off with, I'm a person with extremely high morals and empathy. If someone else is upset, especially if it's to do with me, I can't help but feel sick with sorrow.\nHowever, I've recognised lately that I might have a big issue with romantic validation. I'm 15f, so still a teen, and I'd say I have a very high romance drive, as teenagers normally do. However as everyone else gets into relationships I find myself to turn down anyone that asks me out despite my longing for romance.\nI tend to have a relatively flirty personality and get attached easily, as I start talking to a guy I find myself head over heels almost instantly, like any other teenager. However as I get to know the person more and more I begin to have episodes of doubt whether I actually like them, and then next minute I'm head over heels again. The problems mainly resides when they ask me out. I realise that I can't handle the idea of being in a relationship with them (I attempted it before and it ended terribly as a lot of relationship I knew I didn't like him) and vowed I'd never date someone again until I knew I 100% liked them because of that, because it sickens me how much I can hurt someone. However I find myself having a few romantic encounters the exact same way, and once they ask me out I feel sick and panicked that I've led them on without realising, since I blind myself that I'm not actually in love with them. I feel like maybe I just like the idea of someone liking me so I feel worth someone's affection, but once I've gotten that I need to have that progression of someone falling in love with me, with someone else.\nIn addition to this, a while ago there was a guy I was talking to him, I'd liked him for around 3/4 years however we only started talking about 3 years into my crush on him. I was head over heels for him however I started panicking about him liking me, it was when I realised I had an issue. Once he asked me out I knew it wasn't fair to be with him so I turned him down. I should add that I have no intention of ever telling him this next bit, but we aren't very close now, however we sometimes talk and we were still bestmates for around a year after he confessed, and I have known for ages that I still like him, however whenever those feelings of disgust to date someone come back I feel ill thinking of dating anyone, so I know it's unfair to tell him. Yet I sit here longing for what we had? I don't understand myself. I'm so hooked on love and then suddenly I have such a deep despair at the idea of someone loving me.\n\nI know I sound like a terrible person, I feel that way too. I'm not trying to create sympathy by saying \"I feel bad for leading them on\" I'm just using it to express the emotional dilemma.\n\nIf anyone understands the junk I've just written, please dm me or comment to help me.",

    "text": "Note: This post is all over the place and might have a lot of useless information in it. I don\u2019t even know if I should post this here or post it at all.\n\nSo I (18M) don\u2019t really feel anything besides the basic emotions (happy, sad etc.), like I don\u2019t feel sympathy, empathy or really care about anything. I have a history of very bad anxiety and depression (both diagnosed) and attempted suicide twice when I was 16.\n\nHere\u2019s a little background:\nFirstly I was the middle child in my house and from around the age of around 10 tell I moved out (17) everything was blamed on me, no matter what. Every little thing had to be my fault even though I had nothing to do with  80% of it. There was 24/7 fighting in the house between my parents and siblings.\n\nSecondly from the ages 12 to around early 15s I was off and on with this girl, she would constantly cheat on me, use me for sex, string me along and really mentally hurt me. I lost my virginity to her on my 13th birthday, it was not consensual (nor where the other hundreds of times over the next couple years) at all and I just thought that it was normal for a girl to do whatever to you. From the age of 13 to 15 I would either walk or bike over a km to get to her house no matter the season. I was working at McDonald\u2019s at the time (around 13 and a half since it\u2019s legal where I live) and would spends every little bit of my paycheque on her, buying her whatever she wanted. I would do anything and everything for her, from stealing to walking across my city to pick up some McDonald\u2019s, just for her to send me home a couple hours later once she was satisfied. I thought this was all completely normal at the time because I was madly in love with her for some reason. Looking back on it I was really naive. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the information above is the cause for any of what I\u2019m experiencing but I think it might be. Not being able to show sympathy, empathy or care about anything is really affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. I\u2019ve been living with her and her dad for around 9-10 months. She is a very caring, forgiving, loving and overall an amazing person but I\u2019m causing a lot of arguments, tears and stress between us. I love her to death but I\u2019m afraid of the future ahead of us if I can\u2019t fix myself. I can\u2019t afford therapy either, which is a bonus.\n\nIf anyone could give me any advice, it would mean the world to me. Thank you for reading.",

They really help for the anxiety attacks but that\u2019s about it.\n\nLet\u2019s fast forward to the past 6 years or so The issues that have been contributing to how I am now \n\nSo 6 years ago I had to stop working due to the cartilage in my hips being worn away and causing a huge amount of pain.    I love working and I loved my job but was unable to do it .\n\nIt took 5 years for a surgeon to agree to do full hip replacements  they all kept telling me I\u2019m to young and that in 25 years they will have to be replaced again that I\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019m 50 or older before they will do it.    Great so what do I do now I have 4 kids and bills to pay.     Finally I found a surgeon that would do it as I live in the here and now and who knows if I\u2019ll even be around in 20 years.    \n\nSo I had one hip replaced.    It took a year for most of the pain in that hip to disappear  but there\u2019s still pain there and we can\u2019t figure out why\n\nThey will not replace the other hip until I\u2019m pain free in the one that\u2019s already been replaced.  Great so I\u2019m off work until its all figured out and fixed \n\nAbout 3 years ago my now wife and a 4 month long affaire.      I didn\u2019t know for sure but I was almost 100% positive it was going on      When I confronted her about if she lied and lied and lied some more.     I ended up telling her lies to make her think I had gotten txts and pictures  making her think I had evidence  she finally confessed . \n\nI was heart broken we had been together for 10 years at this point \n\nI\u2019m not sure why she did what she did but at this point in our lives she was taking on more responsibility at work and had just found out her mother had terminal cancer.   \nI had found out that my grandfather also had terminal cancer and along with the issues with my hips wasn\u2019t in great shape I was getting very moody and maybe wasn\u2019t the best person to be around     \n\nIt\u2019s been 2 years and I haven\u2019t gotten over the fact that she cheated on me I think about it all the time as much as I try not to it just keeps playing over and over in my head \n\n\nAt this point my depression had gotten worse     \n\nSo both my mother-in-law and grandfather passed away from cancer 2 months apart  \n\nMy grandfathers passing hit me kinda hard we were not really that close as I was growing up but rather the last 14-15 years we had gotten a lot closer. He was my fishing buddy. \n\nSo the affair the passing of two people in my life and the loss of work has really done a number on me. \n\nAnymore this is how my days go \n\nI wake up at 7am some days get the kids ready for school get them on the bus eat and by then I\u2019m exhausted mentally and physically I end up laying back down and fall asleep.   \n\nI have no drive to do anything I can\u2019t force myself to do anything I sleep 90% of the day  as hard as I try I can\u2019t seem to do anything else \n\nMy wife and kids don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s hard to try and explain things to them and try and help them understand \nMy kids a number of times have called me lazy and often point out that all I do is sleep   This kinda hurts my feeling but there kids and I know that they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with me \n\nMy wife gets upset with me all the time and makes sometimes rude comments I try and explain to her but I see she doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through    She thinks that all I have to do is stay out of bed and things will change not understanding how mentally and physically exhausted I am \n\nI try really hard to get up and do things but just can\u2019t seem to get any drive or motivation to keep going \n\nIv been to the doctor and we have switched my meds around but nothing seems to be helping  \n\nI\u2019m so lost right now.    I wish I could just get up and do things like a normal person I wish I had the drive and motivation  but no matter what I do I don\u2019t.    \n\nSo now my days are filled with wake up eat then sleep    Wake up the next morning eat and sleep.   This all is taking a toll on thins with my kids and wife and honestly I don\u2019t know what to do anymore   \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far thanks very much for sticking it out and taking the time to read my complaining  I hope I didn\u2019t jump around to much and that this post makes some sort of sense",

    "text": "So I've never thought I was depressed. My life is practically perfect. I have a loving family, money to live very comfortably, friends that care about me, high self esteem, etc. But literally today I started recalling some weird behavior that my parents sometimes warned me about. \n\nMy biggest worry is not having a passion, or a hobby that i enjoy doing, and thus relying too much on going out. My parents have been worried about me spending too much time on my phone and not doing anything for some time. I always thought once I'm in college and studying math (what I believe is my passion) I would stop doing it and enjoy. \n\nThese depression like feeling started with COVID when I was alone at home with nothing to do, no hobby, no going out, just homework and watching TV. But again, I knew once everything was normal I would be fine. \n\nI've been on holidays (no work and no college) since December 10. December I hung out with my friends a lot and had a blast and January went on vacation with my family and a friend and again had fun. February I hung out with my friends a lot, but everytime I was alone this empty feeling struck. Like wondering what could I do. \n\nThis is the first reason, the second being some family troubles. My father has been really stressed about the budget of our kitchen's remodelatoon and a bit depressed over work. Furthermore, my sister told my parents she has been dating our cousin for 3 years and they both are pretty hurt (both for the incest and the lies). \n\nAll this is led to me losing interest in math and science. And without that i feel empty, like I have nothing to do in life. I have always been lazy, so I don't consider having a hard time waking up, having a big breakfast, doing chores, etc a symptom, but there's that. \n\nI am a week away from starting university and studying math. I really hope my passion is still there. I even had a feeling (without knowing it's relation to depression, although it is know obvious) that it may not be worth living. It was brief. It was like, all this decision I have to make, things that i have to worry about, things that are hard, etc It may be worth it to be dead. But I think that may be caused by me seeing my father stressed, my mother sad, my grandfather injured and sad, my sister's situation blowing up, and me constantly thinking I have to decide if I want to be a professor, programmer, quant  or scientist right know. I've stressed myself over that decision that is 5 years away from having to be resolved.\n\nI know it's long, but I would appreciate if you could tell me what to do to be fine. What I came up with is (before I thought about depression, actually) is starting college, start working out, do things I don't want to, try hobbies, lower phone use)",

    "text": "(diagnosed ASD and BPD, throwaway account, )\n\nI have a psych appointment soon which I have little hope for cus the mental health service I have recieved has been so bad and my autism makes is difficult to communicate well so theres a few things I have just never had the chance to bring up and following an event last night I'm unsure whether it is worth bringing up so far into my time with 'treatment'.\n\nLast night I stayed at my mums because we got back so late from something. her and her BF went to bed and I went up about an hour after. Over the period of around 30 minutes I grew increasingly scared that a hushed arguement was going on between my mum and her BF in the next room. I waited it out and waited it out. It sounded like it was getting worse. I make out some words and sentences, even though it was a bit muffled. I texted her when I got really scared to ask if everything was okay or if it were the neighbors arguing. At times it sounded like someone was hurt. The arguement went quiet after the text and it took all of 3 minutes before I was almost physically sick and shaking. Another text sent. Heard something that sounded like someone scared or hurt. Jumped up, tip toed to their room because I thought a weapon could have been pulled and I was ready to run out to call 999. Looked round their door. They were both fast asleep.\n\nI freaked out for another 10/15 minutes, shaking, crying, feeling so sick and scared, before eventually calming a little and the exhaution of 30 miles in 2 days and that sudden pound of emotion knocked me asleep. It wasn't a good nights sleep.\n\nI have had similiar happen, but again, non of this is stuff I've told anyone. Like, turning the shower off and looking out because I could hear arguing and it scares me so much, guessing due to the exteme fighting I had in my household as a child. It isn't all the time. Last night I recognise as being extreme. Even when I got up this morning I was terrified the neighbors had hurt each other badly. Apprently there is sometimes late-night bumbling and fumbling from the neighbors (both very old, very deaf, and one with bad dementia) but I was making out the sentences in my head, coming from my mum and her BF.\n\nAnother example is my own neighbors coming in late with friends (thin walls in flats lol) and they were drunk and loud talking and I somehow convinced myself through what I could hear that one of them had passed out and died and they didn't know what to do due to the alchole and guessing drugs they'd consumed.\n\nThis is at the back of my mind right now because today has been even more of a shit. I'm just worried because sometimes this happens when I am alone, so its hard to reassure and I can't exactly ask my own neighbors to keep their arguing down so I don't freak out. I also worry when this happens when others are around me. I am really private and this is really embarassing at times and often is the first trigger to trigger others. Now I'm just so on edge still.",

    "text": "TW: suicide \n\nI don't even know where to start. I'm not diagnosed with any mental illness but I do believe I may have treats to anxiety, depression or DDD.\n\nThis is gonna be all over the place. For a few months I've been feeling inadequate, unnecessary and useless. It got worse at the start of this week, things with my partner got complicated. But it got really worse when a friend from Uni committed suicide 3 days ago. \n\nAbout my friend: \nhe wasn't part of my main friend group, but we still got along well. He was fun to be around, he was a nice, loving person. I never thought he was one to do such a thing. I never knew how much he suffered. I wish I could have been a closer friend to him, even with that, I don't know if could have helped him. \n\nHe died on the 10th, which was his birthday aswell. It didn't make sense, he had plans for a birthday trip on this weekend, he had paid at our Uni to be able to take his exams, everything seemed to be normal. I found out at the funeral that everyone had canceled on him for the trip. I can't help but think he was expecting just one person to be with him to not do what he did.\n\nAt first I wanted to think that it wasn't suicide, maybe he had an accident, an allergic reaction, too much alcohol. Later I found out that he hung himself in his garden, it was definitely not an accident. I haven't told that to anyone else, only a few people from our class know. I know my friends have questions about why and how. I don't know the why, I don't wanna judge it either. I would have preferred to never found out about the how. I would have preferred to still think that maybe it was an accident. \n\nAbout how I feel in general: \nfor a few years I've been feeling that I don't really matter in anyone's life. I do have friends and family,  I do love them but it feels like I'm such a secondary character for everyone. If I died for whatever reason, I don't even know if my friends would find out quickly. \n\nIt's been months that I feel unnecessary for everyone else. I feel like my existence doesn't matter. I know it's my own fault because I don't have the energy to reach out to anyone. But nobody asks me how I'm doing either, and when I do speak up I feel dismissed. Either by them not taking my feelings seriously enough, or by them telling me that they are having ever harder times. Especially with th last one I feel awful, because even though I try to listen and be supportive, I can help but feel like I'm being shut down. I feel like I require so much attention and I hate it, so I end up not seeing anyone for weeks and being really self conscious about how much I talk about myself. \n\nThis last week has been even worse. It's getting difficult to find joy in things I loved just a few weeks ago. Sometimes I feel like my body and my mind aren't my own. I sleep very little even though I'm always tired. And hours can pass with me feeling unconscious even though I'm awake.\n\nI don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I need help, but I don't have the means to get it right now. I don't have a job and my savings are running out quickly. I want to survive this. I'm afraid that if I reach out to anyone in my life I will just feel dismissed again.",

And he said 'I'm not telling you about my family, that's my busines' so abruptly. \n\n*He then broke down about his family and went silent, so I felt like a therapist but this whole time I was there he just shut down and sat with his hands on his head, there was no ounce of fun. I even comforted him, hugged him, relaxed him even though he was mean to me most of the day.\n\n*He called me an idiot multiple times as a joke sure, but it made me feel so shit.\n\n* I was also not looking for a relationship yet as it's been 2 weeks of knowing him? but I felt like I wasted my time. I had no fun at all.\n\n*Told me that my car makes me up myself (red mini cooper convertible) \n\n\nI just felt like a punching bag the whole time.

    "text": "I have a very very limited range of emotions. Many people can feel happiness, empathy, love, anger, etc. But I can't. I can only feel scared, sad, or absolutely nothing. I am also unable to feel any sort of empathy. Barely anything makes me excited. The only type of anger I can feel is frustration or agitation. The only time I have ever been truly pissed were when I was wronged. I also have autism and have trouble knowing what is socially appropriate. As you can imagine, this makes things even more difficult. \n\nI know this may sound extremely stupid, but it came up in a conversation about Chic Fil A on Discord. People were talking about how people shouldn't eat at Chic-Fil-A due to the company's history of donating to anti-LGBT causes. I mentioned my reasoning for my decision while some other people were mentioning their reasoning. In short, my reasoning was that where the money from a company goes does not affect whether I like the product/service of the company, which does not affect whether I still consume the company's products (Please no bashing me in the comments or DMs. I'm not in the mood for that). People seemed to act offended. They talked about stuff like blissful ignorance, that I shouldn't have an opinion on this if I'm not LGBT, this is a horrible mindset to have and it should be changed, nobody should admit that thing out loud, etc. I read through their messages and from an intellectual point, I now sort of understand why they are unhappy. \n\nBut no matter what, I can't feel the same anger or caring about causes and others that they do. So my mindset doesn't show any sign of changing anytime soon. I can't just make myself feel something by force. I have tried to see if I could ever feel something like that with anything. I have gone as far as to watch videos of accounts of victims (from families of 9/11 victims, other terrorist attacks, the Holocaust, etc.) of the events. Still absolutely nothing. \n\nAnd I had trouble knowing how to word stuff or share stuff appropriately. I have had absolutely no way of learning what is socially appropriate unless people actively get mad at me. Resources online for autism seemed geared at parents or children. And I am neither. Social groups for this where I am are either scarce or for those with severe intellectual disabilities. I ask what I did when I offend people but they either don't let me know or say that I should've \"known what I did.\" I am starting to get a better idea of knowing why someone is offended if I get more context.\n\nWith all of this, my sense of ethics is very different. I won't go too deep into it. But I will say that some would say that I lack humanity. My mom called me inhuman. I also tend to have a flat affect (likely from autism and schizophrenia during episodes) so I come across as emotionless, cold, and callous. And I don't like the idea of completely re-wiring myself to fit what others want/expect.\n\n I am forced to pretend in order to make people able to tolerate my presence. And I am a horrible actor. And the few people that call me friends are people who don't know about this. \n\nI'm not a sub human. I'm not a monster. I may not feel much emotion, but I can still feel. But nobody will ever see that. \n\nI am starting to think I should give up on trying to form bonds with other people. I can't relate to others. Bonds can't make me happy. And I need to accept that everybody who gets to know me will hate me.",

Slightly faint and nauseas, but I pushed through it. Sometimes the teacher was talking and I zoned out and felt almost underwater and then i'd zone back in, \"time\" felt weird a couple of times if that makes sense.

My dad has told me he is on the brink of suicide because he doesn't know how he's going to go on living this way with these sufferings. We pray to God every day and have been doing so for months but nothing is improving (please don't comment anything against Christianity its important to us you don't need to tell me you're an atheist)\n\nHe takes anti depression medication but it is not working. My dad is unable to get any work done he will sit at his desk and stare at the monitor screen. I can't help him at all and if he loses his job we will lose the house and I'm sure that once he loses his job he will kill himself and I'm so so scared and worried. My dad had already gone to a mental hospital and is seeing a psychiatrist. I tell my dad to take time off of work but he just keeps saying he needs to work harder and he's doing his best. I know that his best isn't very productive because I'm in the same boat as him we have very similar issues. I also have anxiety, depression, brain fog and tinnitus. I had to withdraw from school because my own brain fog is so bad. I also can't work. Neither of us are on disability.\n\nI just wish we could feel better. I'm so scared of my dad being dead. I don't want to be homeless. I already sleep and have bugs crawl all over me since we live in an old house and they come through the window. Ugh I just need God to help us.",

Then the bus went over a bump and i noticed that he had his entire hand on my crotch, under my backpack which was on my lap. It felt like an eternity but after some time i asked him to please stop doing that, and he immediately did. I left as fast as i could and quickly walked home crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow when i asked him and he stopped, i got a look at his face.

And then i wonder if i should feel bad for him because there was something weird going on, like he had a compulsion.

    "text": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question but my post was removed from r/psychosis for reasons unknown to me.  If it\u2019s not a good place for this content, I apologize and appreciate any redirection to the appropriate subreddit.\n\nFor context, my boyfriend and I have been dating for only about four months but he found me in a time of my life where I honestly kinda have no one after a falling out with my friends.  I stay with him every weekend Friday-Monday morning until I have to leave for school.  He has been nothing short of wonderful to me.  I love him so much, he is so pure and honest and after facing many obstacles with myself he felt like a light at the end of the tunnel for me.  Also to preface, he is extremely intelligent and trades cryptocurrency/NFTs online and is pretty successful in it\u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to work anymore.\n\nIn the couple weeks preceding him being in the hospital, we\u2019ve been arguing out of nowhere but nothing too crazy until 2 weekends ago when we took a short trip together.  He drove the us home (about 2-3hr drive) and talked the ENTIRE time without breaks getting progressively more frustrated the whole time.  He talked even when I was pretending-to be asleep and began saying things that just did not sound right or make sense.  Ever since, when we\u2019ve facetimed this week he has been the same way just talking at me about existential topics and conspiracies.\n\nLast Saturday, he wouldn\u2019t stop again.  There were no breaks of normalcy at all and he kept getting frustrated with me for not understanding and being tired (I was up all night minus maybe 2-3 hours, dealing with this from 8pm until I left at 3pm the following day).  During this time, he kept repeating specific topics, terminology, and phrases.  It started to click for me that something very wrong was going on with him.  \n\nHe lives at his grandparents.  At around 12pm, I woke up to him yelling at his grandmother after she asked him if he was okay.  Not sure what prefaced this, but once he got back in the room the repetitive speech and arguing continued again except even worse than the night before.  He was angry and talking a million words a minute with no real flow of thought.  It was like I wasnt even there and he would not stop, despite me just sitting there crying in silence for the entire 30mins this must have ensued.  Eventually, he calmed down and we went downstairs to eat something.  Once we were in his kitchen, he began yelling at me and calling me stupid because I couldn\u2019t understand his philosophies.  His grandparents walked in and he began yelling at all of us and saying he hates us all.  He got in my face and told me to leave then retreated upstairs.  His grandparents gave me their # and we spoke briefly about how we were worried about him and they told me they would thinking about having him admitted.\n\nOnce I left, within 20mins I was being bombarded by texts guilting me for leaving (despite him demanding i did).  To make a long story short: he texted me from about 2pm that day consistently until 8am the next morning with little to no breaks in between each message.  Talking in code nonsensically, calling me evil then switching and saying he loves me.  I don\u2019t think the specifics really matter, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about the same few topics such as Noah\u2019s arc, this crypto-yet-based-in-philosophy discord community he is in (which is very cult like based on the understanding I have of it now), the author Neitzche and his book \u201cbeyond good and evil\u201d, the meta verse, &amp; more.  I texted his grandparents and his mom screenshots and didn\u2019t sleep all night terrified of the possibility of him hurting himself or someone else.\n\nThe next day, his mom and grandparents had a sort of intervention with him and he ended up going to the mental hospital willingly.  Doctors said they found ketamine in his system and think maybe the dabs he takes or dab pens may have been laced and he is in drug induced psychosis, but we don\u2019t have any final diagnosis right now.  We also found out he hasn\u2019t been sleeping the past couple weeks in order to keep up with his discord based in Canada (different timezones).  The first few days were rough.  We can speak on the phone any time, he was crying, even hysterical the first day or so and wouldn\u2019t speak on the phone more than 1-4mins without urgently saying \u201cgot to go\u201d and hanging up.\n\nFast forward to now, a day short of a week later.  He has been able to make progress I assume due to being medicated and getting sleep.  I was overjoyed yesterday because he stayed on the phone with me for 18 whole minutes and it felt like I was finally talking to my boyfriend again.  We laughed told jokes talked about fun things we\u2019d do when he got home.  And then it all seemed to crash again.  He told me today he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with the way he acted, that he still believes everything he said in his episode, that he resents and hates his grandparents and mother for sending him there.  He said he\u2019s going back to exactly how he was before when he gets out and wont take any medication.  It felt even worse hearing him say that because he said it so coherently after such a good conversation.  He was apologizing to his mom and saying he loved her no more than 48 hours ago.  \n\nIm so lost.  I love him so much I want him to get better.  I feel like the hospital is lacking by not having conversations with him specifically about what happened in his episode and giving him real behavioral therapy rather than just giving him antipsychotics.  Im worried about him, its ALL i can think about even when I go to sleep I dream about him.  I can\u2019t escape it even in school, work, my hobbies for more than a few minutes.  I\u2019m the only person he will even speak to on the phone right now and in his words, \u201cthe only good thing in his life.\u201d  I don\u2019t want to abandon him when he needs me but my mood and mental state is so dependent on how he is acting everyday which is not sustainable or healthy.  He is such a light in the world and such a brilliant person.  Outside of being my boyfriend or anything romantic I believe in him as a person and I want nothing but amazing things for him in his future.  Im at a loss.  I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or comforting words would be so so appreciated.  I feel so alone in this outside of talking to his mom daily, no one really understands or can relate.  Thank you so much for reading if you made it this far.",

    "text": "\nEverywhere I google, articles I've read on the topic claim that succesful outcomes are driven soley by an individuals desire for change and under no circumstances has therapy been proven ineffective for patients who are ready and compliant.\n\nAs someone who has not been to therapy but is thinking about going and has a generally positive outlook. I still find this perspective to be extremely counter-productive, condescending, and offensive.\n\nOf course, anyone who goes to therapy needs to come with an open mind and be cooperative in their treament. Furthermore, establishing an inner sense of responsibility for managing ones health is important. However, why is the onus put squarely on the client if treatment fails?\n\nJust because a treatment has been proven to work for some or even most people does not by extension mean that should it not work for the outlier would it mean that they're the problem.\n\nThat's just not how it works. In medicine, when a vaccine is developed and works for the majority people it is administered but some people have an adverse reaction due to an uncontrollable response in their body, nobody blames them.\n\nSo I don't think it's even remotely fair to essentially blame someone who is ill for them continuing to be ill despite genuinely trying to get better.\n\nIn psychology the term resistance is asscribed to individual's who don't do their homework, or reject the therapists advice on how they should address their problems. That by definition is considered resistance, but I'm not referring to these people.\n\nI'm talking about people who are doing the things being asked of them and still feel terrible for some reason or another. I find it disheartening to know that the people supposed to be trying to help us actually believe these things.\n\nThe weirdest part is that even the therapists who do not believe that deliberate resistance is the issue when things don't go right, they still have this underlying belief that the inherent resistance of the client to change is instead part of the pathology that needs to be treated.\n\nIt's kind of disgusting to be honest. It portrays clients as these weak, truant and selfish people for not being able to change despite being willing participants in their treatment.\n\nIt makes me feel somewhat hesitant about persuing my own therapy, because my fear is that if it doesn't work I'll feel worse off for \"not having tried hard enough\" and people will judge me for it.",

I try really hard to be happy for them and not ruin their day by bitching about not being invited, but that results in me sitting alone while everyone else is making memories together. It's gotten to a point where I would be invited to things and say no, specifically because I thought they were only inviting me out of pity and they would have more fun without me. This resulted in my friends not really inviting me to anything anymore.   \n\n\nRight now, all of my college friends are spending their spring break together in Nashville, while I sit in my room alone.

(persecutory). that \"someone\" is our neighbour, who she believes gasses our flat and specifically her rooms to try and kill her/get her to move out, and that he's in possession of this \"air purifier\" that is killing her, and also cooks all the time on purpose.\n\u2022 this had led to me needing to call the ambulance for her with \"symptoms\" such a chest pains, drying out/burnt skin and eyes, metallic taste in mouth, etc, from the neighbours alleged cooking and gasses. \n\u2022 ive had to stay at my boyfriend's house for weeks because she forbid me and herself to stay there as it was too \"dangerous\" (even though i always feel completely fine, while she describes her symptoms as if she's dying) and also staying in the garden at  freezing temperatures because she is too paranoid to stay in the flat. we have called the gas company and the fire brigade multiple times to identify a leak that my mum insists it exists \u2014 it was confirmed that the property is safe with no leaks. the last time the fire brigade came, i was called to talk to them in privacy and they told me they're trying to be a diplomatic as they can but they know my mum is just imagining this.\n\n\u2022 she is obsessed with the neighbour being out to get her, though in the past she has concentrated on other neighbours with similar types of delusions. she constantly messages the landlord about this problem which to an outsides would look like borderline harassment with the amount of texts. speaking of harassment, there have been countless times where my mum has screamed at the neighbour and she's also kicked his door at 3am thinking he is cooking. \n\n\u2022 i have offered my mum to sleep in my room/swap rooms but she insists that she can still feel the gas strongly and that i can't tell that it's affecting me. she has slept in my room on my floor, in my bed, in the corridor, kitchen, right now she is sleeping in the bathtub.\n\n\u2022 the landlord has agreed to move us to another flat of his, but i have made up my mind that i will not be living with her anymore. this was a secret until recently, when i broke it to her a few days ago she refused to take it as my decision. she's told the landlord ive agreed to move in with her to this new flat, when all ive told her is the opposite and to respect my decision. she now is trying to force me to do a masters degree so she can claim benefits from me living with her as a student which is masked by \"good intentions\" by saying i will not get good pay or promotions without one which is absolutely not true in this time of age. she tries to manipulate me by saying if i loved her id do this and that. 3 years ago, she has forced me to pursue a business bachelors degree while not caring about what i actually want or am interested in. she's also said i can live anywhere i want, as long as im down on her papers and she's still getting her money.\n\n\u2022 i have been suffering from her physical and verbal abuse before i turned 18, as of now, she acts entitled to my student loan and seemingly manipulates me to get her money from the government. needless to say, the toll on my mental health is huge, i am exhausted and stressed from her. \n\n\u2022 i have plans to move in with my friend who knows what i am going through, i want to leave ASAP to protect my wellbeing. my moving out will likely happen very fast and i will have to pack up and leave when she isn't home to avoid bad conflict. i have always tried to communicate my needs and wants to her but i am never listened to, instead ive always been forced to do what she wants. i do feel guilty about leaving her alone, which will very likely get me disowned, as it has happened with our previous family members, who i am regularly compared with. it troubles me when i think of her all alone. we don't have any family members in this country, or many friends who can support her.\n\n\u2022 i have emergency services saved on my phone in case she ever harms herself. in terms of her mental health, she rejects any hints of her being mentally ill/having delusions so a formal diagnosis is very unlikely unless it is by force.\n\ni have left out a lot of details. again, sorry if there are any unclear sentences.",

    "text": "First timer to antidepressant medication here and quite frankly rather worried about taking it! I'm 29 living in England currently.  \n\n\nThis might be a bit of a disorganised mess as I'm not sure how to best put it so please, expect some rambling as I try to get my bearings in text.  \n\n\nI have just picked up my prescription of Sertraline 50mg (Zoloft) and it's just sitting on my shelf making me more anxious if I am to be honest. I guess after talking to my doctor about my mental health and breaking down over the phone at work about it, she had decided that the first priority is to make me feel better. Hence the prescription but I can't help to wonder and worry if I actually need it or was it prescribed to me because of me breaking down over the phone making it sound worse than it might be.  \n\n\nTo offer some information, I'm under a lot of financial stress and familial obligations currently placed on me to take care financially of my parents. My mother fell ill with sepsis and pneumonia which landed her in the ICU for a while, later rendering her disabled and unfit to ever go back to work. She receives some small benefits but since they don't amount to much and my father doesn't earn enough on his own I have to subsidise my own wage (which is not much to begin with) to pay for their mortgage and general bills such as water, food, electricity, heating and so on. I am also in charge of taking care of the house.  \n\n\nI have lost interest/enjoyment in most of my hobbies, doing them now mainly to just have something to do. I've grown extremely easy to be irritated with people around me, and prone to crying when I reflect that I'm 29, currently living with my parents with no savings of my own and practically working for money which I don't even get to spend on myself at all. Those thoughts don't help when all my friends around me seem to be getting on so well in their lives/careers. I work as a retail assistant in a place I absolutely hate therefore from the moment I clock in I have to be social with a lot of people, not all reasonably polite, and by the time I get home at 9 pm I just load up a plate of dinner and shut myself in my bedroom with it, hoping neither of my parents will want anything from me, to repeat the same cycle the next day.  \n\n\nI have sometimes wondered if it would be easier if I just didn't exist but I honestly don't believe I'd ever want to pull through with that thought as I don't actually want to die. Quite opposite, I want to live and be able to do all kinds of things.  \n\n\nAnd despite having even put all of that in writing I'm still doubting the decision of whether I should start taking my prescribed antidepressants. I have tried counselling before in my 3rd year of university with regular sessions for half a year but I didn't feel like it had helped me at all. I'm not even sure if this is what it's like to be depressed as this has been my life pretty much for about 5/6 years now and I have learned to somewhat keep myself above the surface.  \n\n\nLong story short, I'd very much appreciate reading someone else's view/opinion over this, especially someone who's been or is currently on antidepressants.  \n\n\nThank you so much if you have made it through this jumbled mess of mine!",

I've read the rules of the subreddit and did my best not to break any.  \nMoving to the substance: I had a thought today and I wanted to share it and ask you about your views on the subject.  \nIt is often advised to have a routine, to create a schedule and plan what you want to do in every hour of the week. I tried it several times, but often, when I should be e.g. reading I feel I'd like to spend this time writing, or playing music or doing anything else. I just do not feel like reading. I like to do all of these things, and all of them bring me joy - would that be bad to substitute one for another, as long as I feel I do something worthwhile? Feeling compelled to do a specific thing causes I do not want to do that thing that much.  \nSometimes you can read an advice we should act more like kids: do stuff that we just want to do at the moment. Niklas Luhmann (known for Zettelkasten note-taking method) related he usually do what he feel like doing (https://notes.ceilfors.com/Luhmann\\_always\\_worked\\_on\\_something\\_easier\\_and\\_interesting.html) and it seemed to work for him.  \nI did not find any studies that would favour that approach, but it seems sensible to me.

I do know the claim about \"chemical imbalance\" is just a trope, and an advertising trick. The whole taboo about being sad, anxious or confused, thinking strange things and similar, have probably put a huge pressure on people in modern times, specially since it's normal to connect people doing crime \"crazy\" and explaining evil things people do or say with some kind of disorder. So then people will try to be as normal as possible, it seem obvious to me that many people are only playing some kind of game, pretending to be some type of \"average personality\" that they can share with others with no danger of being thought of as crazy or criminal, not dangerous, not bad etc. Also if anyone are told they are mentally ill, they will probably, no matter how hard they try, feel bad about feeling so bad, and have to cope with even more stress and sadness because it's impossible for a human to ever get normal. The truth is that most are weirdos. Who knows what kind of strange ideas those around us have? Sometimes I feel I'm normal and the world is insane. War and such are in no way normal. Neither is sickening wealth in some and letting others die in starvation and lack of basic needs.  \n\n\nAnyway, this is just me ranting. I got mental health illness, I've been told.

Going further back when I got in my High School - Basically, I was a very sober and usual guy I'd say but things changed when I started my high school, I made friends who were ambitionless drunkards and ig their company did affect me when I was thinking about my career and stuff. I kinda almost partied every day during those two years but still, I managed to get great grades and win awards in competitions and stuff so like every teenager I got cocky ofc. Then finally 2months before the exam came I thought I'd clear it anyways but yeah I couldn't, I cried all night and stuff. It was back in August 2021 tho. Then I decided not to go to normal colleges and maybe start preparing again and did so. While I was preparing I did meet a great person and decided we'd prepare together, the person was in their 12th standard and they had to give exams for both 12th and the entrance so it was stressful for that person ofc, but yeah I did get great help from that person and maybe I was kinda dependent on that person too. It was going great until now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week - Basically I gotta text yesterday from the person I was preparing with that they have their exams and a lot of stuff so they won't be able to continue now and stuff, Which I totally understand and I wish they do great, But it's just that now I do not have anybody or anything to look forward to in my preparation, the exam is probably in 3months, I've made good progress as of now but yeah I mean it feels like I do not have much look forwards too now Idk what to do. I really wanna clear this entrance and get into a great university but it's just that it kinda seems hopeless now and Idk if this is a phase or what but I'm definitely not feeling like myself and have no idea what to do.\n\nSo sorry for writing so much stuff, I just wanted to tell this somewhere maybe, I know it might not seem very serious but my whole life depends upon the exam and I don't know how to get myself back on track. \n\nI hope people reading this suggest me something, It's totally alright if this gets ignored, at least I could say this :))",

It branches from a real situation but turns the situation bad if that makes sense. For example, I'll be helping my partner out with something if he's sick, and my mind plays a scenario where I'm doing exactly that, but he snaps at me and we have an argument. We never actually really argue we're very good at communicating our feelings and thoughts generally. So in the intrusive thought scenario I'm mad at him and then in real life I become mad at him. I don't take it out on him I just try to let it simmer down on it's own but it really really bothers me to the point that I start to spiral and worry if we should be together if I'm that easily annoyed at something he hasn't done.

Everyone makes mistakes but still I keep thinking about it and am dreading going tomorrow to the meeting where we will discuss our findings. \n\nCan someone please help me, like how can I stop feeling so sad and embarrassed about this small thing and why is it that big of a deal to me.\n\nI guess it could also be because I sent a message I misunderstood and to just ignore my email.

Other than that I've not eaten since being admitted 10 days ago. I don't even feel that hungry; it's like after 3-4 days my body just rarely recognises that im hungry\n\nI don't feel I deserve to eat, im a cunt. I've been a cunt all my life and will be a cunt until the day I die, hopefully soon, definately before my mom who has cancer. She's the only reason im alive right now and my relationship with her and the rest of my family is terrible to say the least. They unconditionally love me and I hate myself for it, I don't deserve love. \n\nI went into care at 12, you'd think I'd chill after this but I just became a bigger cunt. My whole life has been me being an imp to society and now that I've came to terms with it I just want to die. Im not dead because my mom is alive and battling cancer, yet I cannot even speak to her without being under the influence because of the tremendous guilt I feel. \n\nI've cut myself a lot, I hadn't cut myself since I was 13, im now 22. I've contemplated stabbing myself numerous times and went into respiratory arrest two weeks ago due to an overdose after I self harmed. Im lucky to be alive but I feel unlucky. If I were dead my family would finally be able to close the book on my life and get on with it. My mom has cancer she doesn't need stress, im battling the thoughts of ending this chapter in their lives by killing myself or fighting through and trying to repair relationships. Either should help my moms mental state. Just one solution is guaranteed to stop her ever worrying again.\n\nEdit: my family don't even know im in hospital. I do prefer being the ignorant selfish cunt of a son than being seen as the attention seeking 'poor me' fucking prick who does nothing to help himself or others. Which is what I am... without the attention seeking part!",

    "text": "CW: Sexual Coercion\n\nAs a child I witnessed (overheard) a sexual encounter between two adults, Dana and Greg (not their real names, using for clarity), I knew that I genuinely didn't really understand or react to it at the time. At the time I really didn't see this to be traumatizing in any way. For a long time, I basically forgot it.\n\nAs an adult with a better understanding of consent and first-hand experience dealing with just how scary and exploitative landlords can be I remembered that incident really vividly while in a period of extreme financial precarity worrying about rent. Dana was Greg's landlady, and she regularly, (and with hindsight quite inappropriately) was extremely palsy with her tenants and got drunk with them. Knowing from my own experience I can't say I'd be comfortable in that situation or even capable of saying no. Dana also regularly acted towards me and others in a way that made it clear she was oblivious, or perhaps willfully oblivious, to the way she wielded power over other people. You really cannot consent while drunk to your landlady of all people.\n\nI really wasn't traumatized by this at all as a child but now I somewhat regularly and unpleasantly recall it. Feeling these incredibly irrational and overwhelming feelings of guilt. I wish I could talk to Greg about it in some way but I don't even know his last name and wouldn't want to re-traumatize him. I have no contact with Dana anymore but I have mutual friends and family members that I feel I can't speak to about it because I'm such a black sheep socially. I'm so worried about acting like Dana myself that I am hypervigilant to the point of neurosis about consent during sex. When people talk about sexual violence as a thing exclusively done by men to women I get really mad. \n\nI feel like I have some PTSD adjacent symptoms but so much of the literature on the subject is about traumas that were clearly and obviously traumatic at the time. Is there any research or work on the subject of cases like mine?",

Of course, I would never stick with it and it would go away quickly. However, the past few weeks have been very difficult on me in terms of my mental health. I haven't been eating much because I just can't bring myself to get out of bed. It is not because I want to lose weight, even if I should. I am simply too out of it and not in the mood to cook. \n\nI tried to cook something yesterday but the chicken I had in the fridge smelled like Satan's asscrack after a workout. So, naturally, I shoved down some chips and a whole entire bottle of diet Pepsi and called it a day. Of course this type of eating will result in you losing weight, but I have also been losing sleep and losing my mind. I also didn't get my period this month. (Not pregnant) and I have no energy to do anything so I am left with three huge assignments due by Friday. \n\nWorse than this? I missed several classes last few weeks because I just couldn't move. I can't even cry. So, when I finally called a friend of mine (video call) and she said \"oh btw you've lost weight. Keep going\" I was shocked to feel the way I did. I felt like I got caught doing sth bad. It is not intentional. I'm not anorexic. I'm just in a slump. But that comment made me realize how much I didn't want to be unhealthy. It was bad and good. \n\nBefore, I would've loved hearing this. Especially when I was deliberately starving myself. Now, hearing this made me uneasy. It isn't my choice, I am not doing it on purpose. I have no control over it. It feels like I am losing a battle. \n\nAnyways... It's 3 pm and so far I have had 1 yogurt drink and 1 red bull and half an instant noodle. At least I ate something solid.",

    "text": "I can't really talk to somebody about this, so let's see what strangers on the internet have to say about this.\n\nHi, I'm a student from Europe. Any people have experienced something similar to this, or may know what is going on?\n\nFor the last three weeks I have felt severely paranoid. In the evening, I sit at my desk and it feels like somebody is standing behind me, and I keep seeing shadows in doorways. When I listen to music I hear weird noises that aren't supposed to be there. Sleep is also causing me trouble, I don't sleep well and have nightmares because of this.\n\nYesterday night I was looking for a book in my room and listening to music through my headphones, suddenly it felt like someone was attacking me, an overwhelming feeling, like there was somebody touching my shoulder to grab me. I almost let out a loud scream had a panic attack after that and couldn't calm down. It was terrifying . Luckily I had my cat by my side and kind of calmed down after an hour.\n\nAnother important thing to mention is that I have a severe phobia of any kind of insects. Since spring is coming to my country, there I have seen countless bees and bugs, thus I can't really go outside anymore. When I left the house today and saw a bee, it suddenly felt like they were swarming all over my body. It absolutely terrified me, but my phobia is nothing new and I have gotten used to it.\n\nUsually listening to music or going for a walk (only in winter months with no insects outside) has helped, reading a book or having some fresh fruit. The last few days have been tough, because these things don't work anymore. I feel like I'm loosing my mind. \n\nI used to see a therapist for said phobia, depression and PTSD, but I couldn't see them for the last two months for insurance reasons, although I am working on getting an appointment again. I am really not sure if I should mention anything of this, since I'm only seventeen and afraid that somehow my parents may find out. \n\n I had some similar paranoid thoughts since childhood, but they have grown so much over the last month. \n\nDid anybody here have a similar experience to this? I obviously understand that I can't get professional advice from the internet, just wanted some opinions, and maybe some advice on how to cope with this if anybody ever felt like this  :)",

    "text": "Throwaway account here.   \n\n\nSo this is probably going to be long. Very long. And all over the place as so much has happened and I'm horrible at explaining these things so I'll try and break things up into groups. No need to respond, just want to vent all this shit since my therapists/partner don't want to listen and I have no one else I can talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHouse:\n\nWe lived in a 4 bedroom farmhouse with A LOT of people consisting of my two grandparents, mother, father, brother, aunt, uncle and uncles girlfriend and son. My brother and I shared a room, my grandmother slept on the couch in the living room, her son and his group turned the family room into a bedroom. The place was always a mess, I don't think I can recall a single time in my life that it was actually clean. The kitchen always had dirty dishes on the counter, baskets upon baskets of unmatched socks lined up against the wall, rotten food on the counter and cat puke, so much cat puke. Our laundry room/pantry always had mounds of clothes on the floor, so much so that I experienced my first death in there. We had a lot of cats, like too many to count. None of them were fixed and the females were outdoor cats so they would constantly get knocked up. One of the cats ended up pregnant and had her litter in the mounds of clothes. Since there was so many things on the floor no one knew about the nest of kittens and one ended up crushed by someone stepping on the mound. \n\nThis place was a literal death sentence and how child services never came by despite so many people dropping in is beyond me. \n\nThere were ashtrays everywhere. My grandparents and mother smoked like chimneys in that house. The bedrooms were always a mess, our front yard looked like a junkyard. There was broken cars everywhere, bags of garbage torn up alongside the shed. Bottles just thrown out on the deck. Old toys that no longer worker in piles around the yard. We could have aired our own episode of 'Hoarders' while living there.\n\nBecause of the mess, a lot of my friends were never allowed over. Their parents would see the state of the home and deem it unsafe for their children, and rightly so.\n\nUpbringing: \n\nMy mother (18) and father (17) conceived me over one too many shots of tequila and referred to me as the 'Tequila baby' and the 'Mistake' when I was growing up. My mother never had much to do with me, she was too preoccupied with a massive online multiplayer (MMO) to care what I was doing. My fondest memories of her was playing Dark Age of Camelot with her, sneaking sips of her rum and coke, and pretending to smoke the cigarettes she asked me to fetch from my grandmother (I was about 7-8 during all this) for her. My father who had dropped out of high school when I was first born had been juggling several jobs and his schooling while she took care of me which translated into drink, smoke, play games, and pawn child off to my grandmother.\n\n\\--\n\nMy brother was planned and he was my mothers pride and joy. She loved him with every ounce of her body. And the more she loved him, the more she resented me. She would remind me every day my father was at work how I was the child who wasn't meant to be. How their lives would have been so much better had she of just found out a little bit sooner that she was pregnant so she could have gone through with the abortion. How I was fat and how not even she could bring herself to love something so pathetic. When my father caught word of how I was being treated, rather than break things off he got heavy into drinking and started becoming physically abusive towards her, which in return made things all the worse for me. \"It's your fault, it's your fault.....it's your fault\" I was always told it was my fault. I remember a point in my childhood when I ran away, I was young and scared, and didn't know what else to do. When I was found, my mother locked me in a room for several hours. I wasn't allowed to eat, wasn't even allowed to go to the bathroom. When my dad came home from work I remember him yelling at her demanding he know why the door was tied shut with rope when he was told he opened the door and just stared at me. No embrace, no endearing words, nothing. He just handed me my gameboy and said don't do it again. Like thanks?\n\n\\--\n\nBrother:\n\nMy brother and I are 5 years apart and despite that 5 year difference he was abnormally strong as a child. I genuinely feared him. He had my fathers temper and anything would set him off. He used to chase me and our cousin with knives, threatening to kill us. Had tried suffocating me with a pillow on multiple occasions and anytime there was a blunt object, he would beat me with out just for fun. He used to say how the more I screamed, the more fun it became. Despite all this, he was considered the golden child. I don't know if my parents and grandparents honestly believed him when he would say \"I didn't do anything\" or \"She started it!\" or if they just turned a blind eye but I dreaded coming home from school and having to be cooped up in a room with him. Asides for the pillow, his other weapon of choice was a metal handled swiffer and by the gods did it hurt. Rather than fight back I would cower under whatever I could and just accepted my fate. One day I actually did fight back, he had hit me so hard the skin on my nose broke and I was bleeding. I took a can of Pepsi Max out from the fridge and threw it at him as he was walking away. It hit his head and split it open. He didn't need stitches or anything but there was blood. Of course, I was grounded and locked in my room.\n\nAunt:\n\nPfff, this woman is a complete joke. Nasty and a narcissist. She used to lock me in one of those big wooden wardrobes for hours because it was 'fun'. Then would gloat to her friends on how her discipline was the best in town. Hell, she tied me up to the stair rails one day tight enough I was bound there and unable to move without hurting myself then proceeded to take pictures and laugh. Her room was probably the dirtiest out of all them in the house (yes, even worse than the laundry room). When she had her two kids she would just throw the dirty diapers on the floor and call it a day. When the smell got so unbearable she would summon her mother (my grandmother) to come clean it. Had her parents pay her mortgage then kicked them out on the curb once it was paid off. Nothing nice to say about her.\n\nHygiene: Parents never really cared if their kids were clean or not. Was never taught that brushing your teeth 2-3 times a day was a thing. Didn't even know how to wash my hair or body until I was way older.\n\nSchool:\n\nFrom primary - grade 7 I was always bullied. Elementary school was probably the worst. I always went to school with unwashed clothes and looking like a grease mop. I didn't have many friends and had a hard time socializing with the other kids. My best friends were three boys who were complete nerds. Highly uncool, but I loved doing our Pokemon roleplays, slicing our fingers off while trying to battle each others beyblades and getting into intense card battles with our yugioh cards. However, as my home life started falling more and more into chaos, I began drifting apart from them. Eventualyl I started drifting apart from everyone, especially when my mother and father separated. When mom left, things got worse at home. Dad became even more of a drunk and started getting extremely physical and verbal with me. He started to hate me because I looked too much like my mother and would often tell me that. \n\nI started going through puberty in grade 4 (Year older than all the other kids, started a year late due to my birthdate) and ended up with horrible acne, I also started gaining weight and my breasts were more developed than the rest of the kids. They always made fun of me for my appearance and I remember a kid (Emily, her face used to piss me off, lol) who would always say \"If you actually washed your face, you wouldn't have pimples\" I remember it made me so self conscious  \nWhen I got into grade 5 I almost never showed up for class and when I did I never had any work completed. My grade 5 teacher was a hockey enthusiast and broke our class up into teams based off the NHL. The goal was to earn more points than the other team by completing assignments, doing good on tests, etc and by the end of the year the winning team would win tickets to a Mooseheads game and a pizza party. Now my class had a lot of sports junkies in it and of course, who wouldn't want to win free pizza? This set up a rivalry amongst the kids and me being anti-homework, set the students on my 'team' against me. They hated me all the more when our team (Anaheim) lost. \\*shrugs\\*\n\nWhen I hit junior high (grade 7) my hormones were absolutely raging. My face was always inflamed and the breakouts were absolutely crazy. To top things off my weight had gotten significantly worse and my hygiene still hadn't improved. The boys in my class always made fun of me but I didn't mind, it was attention albeit not good attention. My home life still sucked, mother disappeared to the States and stopped returning calls, brother was still psychotic, mess in the house became worse, grandfather was always angry and father was always drunk. I no longer hung out with my trio of nerds and instead started hanging out with two of the more popular girls in the school. They were pretty, social, and likable .. unfortunately, they would pave the way for my addiction. \n\nAddiction:\n\nThe two girls mentioned above had tried ecstacy during the summer before grade 8 and had told me how awesome it was. The way they said it made them feel, well ... I wanted to feel that to. I just didn't know how to get a hold of it. One day I was going through my dads drawer and lord and behold I found a pipe and black baggie. There being a pipe I thought there would be weed in the bag which I would have taken a few pieces of to smoke in my makeshift pop can bong but instead of finding that beautiful green I found several pills akin to the ones my 'friends' had spoken about along with a capsule with some unknown powder in it. Curious I took the contents to my room and popped two of the pills and after a little while I started feeling AMAZING. I never had so much energy before and I was so happy. I called up my 'friends' and asked them to meet me at the school, when they did they confirmed that it was ecstacy that I had. I think I was around the age of 14 when this happened. Anyway, from there I got further into my drug experimentation and I was loving every high. I had already started smoking and drinking when I first started grade 7, but this road to grade 8 drug exploration beat all. The unknown capsule I had stolen, I parachuted. Came to find out it was a meth bomb. Thanks dad.\n\nSpeaking of, once my dad found out I had started getting into harder drugs, he actually ASKED me to see my newly acquired dealer and get him something. He would give me an extra 5-10$ so that I could get my pills anytime I picked up for him. Anyway, I had made all kinds of friends along the way during that summer although now I realize they weren't really my friends, the only common interest we had asides for anime and music was drugs and alcohol. I started getting heavier into the pills, would steal some of my friends opiates, almost always stole money from my grandmother to supply my habit and would attend class high. When the high got too much to handle, I would just leave class and go hang out with the other druggies for the day. I started not coming home and would stay out all night. Eventually I just stopped going to school all together. By the time my grade 8 year was over, I had lost over 70lbs, lost a tooth or two, lost my virginity, had several pregnancy scares, two overdoses and a craving for pills, coke and alcohol.  Thankfully, the addiction only lasted for two and a half years.  \n\n\nPartying:\n\nI had become the complete opposite of what I was before. I went from introvert to extrovert. I had no fears, I would speak up for myself, had all these people I could talk to, showed confidence in what I wore and how I spoke. I was considered the life of the party. I started partying with an older crowd and due to my size they always called me the baby of the group and would look out for me. This feeling of acceptance, it was something I had never felt before. I never received this kind of love from my family or peers at school. I felt like I truly belonged. The only problem was, we were almost always drunk .. or high. This is going to sound extremely conceited but, I was considerably one of the more attractive girls within this new group I had found and with that warranted a lot of attention and advances from both girls and guys not that I was complaining during this time. Looking back on it, I'm lucky my risky behavior didn't end up getting me killed or sold of to some sex trafficking ring. \n\nRape:  \nDuring my partying years (14-16.5) I had met this guy at multiple parties. The first time I had met him, we were all strung out on all sorts of things. His girl friend (who later became very close to me) and him had gotten into an argument over something and he had hidden himself from everyone else. His good trip turned bad pretty quick. Anyway, I found him and was completely blown away by his appearance and how he spoke. He was not only beyond good looking but an intellectual as well. As lame as it sounds, I guess you could say it was love at first sight. Him and I became close, we were always together. Everyone that knew us always thought we would end up together, the problem was .. he was still with his girlfriend, and although nothing happened between us while they were together I still felt bad. When they had finally broken up, I talked things over with her and she said \"If you want to fuck, that's fine. Just be careful.\" I didn't understand the just be careful thing. It wasn't until far later that she opened up and explained. After several months, she came to me and told me he had raped her. Of course, being so high up in the clouds and madly in love with this guy, I didn't want, would not believe her. That put a huge strain on our relationship, but I didn't care. I was with the guy of my dreams. Fast forward a month or so later. I'm at his place with another friend of mine (B) and we're having a few drinks. I'm about ready to black out when he calls me to his room and throws me on the bed. I tell him, I don't want to, I'm not feeling well, pretty sure I'm going to be sick, etc. Does that stop him? Nope, he shoves it in my ass and I just shove my face into the bed and cry. B comes into the room, throws him off and I just cry into her lap for what seemed like hours before I passed out. Needless to say, I believed his ex after that incident. Her and I reconciled and she told me I can't let it stay silent, otherwise it will just keep happening. Said \"When your ready, and it might take a while, make sure you tell your story\" When I finally felt ready to tell someone, I told his friend group which had become close with me what had happened. They believed me right up until he dismissed everything. I cut myself for the first time that night.\n\nSelf Harm/suicide: \n\nI burned myself a lot, however I never really cut myself until the night everyone accused me of lying about being raped. Despite having burn marks all over my arms, no one in my family ever really said anything and kind of just brushed it under the rug. Flash forward to when I was 22 and I tried overdosing on my antipsychotics, spent 3 days in the hospital. My fathers remark \"Oh look, now we have something in common\"\n\nPregnancy:\n\nI ended up pregnant at 17, I was already off drugs but was still heavy into drinking. Quit everything cold turkey. When my dad found out, he called me a whore and choked me. If it weren't for that aunt I was complaining about earlier, who knows what would have happened. I moved in with my partner, worked a minimum wage job as a cleaner and kept pushing preparations for the baby aside. My partner cheated on me several times while I was pregnant but no matter how many times I tried to leave him I kept letting him come back.\n\nFlashforward cause if I don't more things will pop up and I wont stop typing:\n\nI'm now 27, have no actual skills or experience in anything. I have no talent. No idea what I like or dislike. Have been living in a place crawling with bedbugs and mold for 4 years and can't keep it clean for the life of me despite trying every damn day to clean it. I'm stuck living on the system while I attempt to finish school and raise my child. Have tried every day getting a job but unfortunately have no child care. I literally have no friends since I decided to shove them all away when my daughter was born because I have abandonment issues according to my therapist. Have been a recluse for  almost 4 years and because of that have developed severe social anxiety. It has gotten to the point where it feels as though I've become a mute when I try to speak to someone or I become extremely awkward. I'm still with my cheating partner despite being beyond miserable with him. He doesn't help out around the home because he \"works every day\" but yet feels it necessary to throw his stinky work clothes all over the apartment and trash on the floor. He doesn't offer much in regards to affection and loves guilt tripping when I don't want to put out. Which by the way, my libido has dropped to practically 0. My practitioner put me on Seroquel and since taking them, I went from relatively attractive and confident to imo ugly and self conscious. I have packed on the weight (went from 120lbs to 200lbs since starting Sero). My hair is basically all falling out, I look 10 years older than what I used to. This image of myself definitely isn't helping the social anxiety, if anything it's just made things worse. Oh and I suddenly have amenorrhea. Have gone in for all kinds of blood work but everything comes back negative so there's nothing medically wrong with me. \n\nI'm constantly thinking about what it would be like if I was dealt different cards. Would things have turned out better had someone of taken the time to get me the mental health help I needed when I was younger? What if people stopped turning a blind eye and actually called child protective services. Would I have had a chance then? \n\nI've only worked that shitty cleaning job from when I was pregnant and have since been either fired or unable to secure work since then. Despite having my high school no one wants to fire because I don't have past experience with the type of work. \n\nI'm constantly looking for a pity party because my mood is so far in the dumps I just want someone ANYONE to acknowledge me, hey! we see and are here for you! but can't have that happen if I've pushed aside any person who has ever tried to help me. \n\nThe only reason I haven't attempted suicide is because of my daughter. I want her to have a chance in this world and not end up how I did. \n\nI have I think one person (who i don't even see, because god forbid I be normal and leave the house once in a while) and the last time he had seen me was like 5-6 years ago. He still checks up on me but I'm too damn self conscious with how much my overall image has changed that I keep blowing him and his fianc\u00e9 off whenever they ask if I would come down. I even blew off their damn baby shower because I just hate myself so much.\n\nWhat's worse is I know people have had it far worse and I can recuperate from this, and I know I will .. but in the moment, it just feels damn well near impossible and my heart truly goes out for all those who are dealing with this crap.   \n\n\nWhew, mental illness is the worst.",

    "text": "Today my day went as normal, until i was to go open a door outside. I realized then i had forgotten my keys. I really neededt to open the door quick, as inside was a pump i needed to give to my dad so he could pump up his bike. But as i said, i didnt have the keys, so i went inside and looked for around 5 minutes. My dad shouted at me, asking if i got the pump. I said no, sweating heavily, and then said i couldnt find the keys to the door.  \n\n\nHow could i not find the keys, i had failed my dad. I had failed him in one of the most simplest of tasks, opening a fucking door. I rushed into the bathroom and had a mental breakdown over what had happened. My mind raced with thoughts of my failure, nothing else. Reality was gone, i saw nothing except a repeated image in my mind of me failing to open the door due to the lack of keys. I sat there for 15 minutes, constantly having a battle against myself in my own mind about what had happened. I ripped apart a few calender pages and 2 toothbrushes until i finally calmed down, although shaking and stressing over what my dads reaction would be when i came out. I could only think of all the bad things that couldve happened. However, he had found the keys, and wondered where i had gone. I just pretended to have had a bathroom break and we continued working on the bike like normal. But i constantly had the though of that in the back of my head, infact, while writing this, i still get bad memories from that, even if i now know that thinking like that is dumb.  \n\n\nThis is one of the many series of events ive had for the last 2 years, where i can fail to do anything, and everything falls apart. I also constantly am scared that people will shout at me, spout negative things about me, or generally attempt to humilate me. Hell, once i had a thought that my friends were all going to humiliate me infront of a crowd of people with shameful stories of mistakes i had done in the past, and then proceed to leave me alone, with nobody else. I constantly say \"sorry\" after everything mildly wrong i do. I feel like i need to do that so the people around me dont get mad at me. Everything something even mildly bad happens, my mind shuts down and can only think about the thing ive done, and the consequenses i shall suffer.",

    "text": "This whole novella of a rant is probably more for me because I know I can't tell anyone I know about it and writing in my journal doesn't do the trick anymore. \n\nMore and more I'm feeling scared of being trapped as the only caretaker of a bipolar friend and more and more I get angrier towards our mutual friends who seemed to have \"abandoned\" me to this role. \n\nI know that these are all bad things to say, friends should help each other out and people have a lot of shit on their plate too. That's why I'm here - I got nowhere else to vent. \n\nMy main friend group consists of 4 girls I met in college. I'll call them L (the bipolar friend), M (the married friend), B (the teacher), and D (my best friend). We've been friends for 14 years. In Nov-Dec 2020,  L, our bipolar friend, was going through a massive depressive episode - weeks before, her 6-year relationship ended and things at work weren't going well also. 11PM one weeknight, L texted if she could come to our house. She was already harming herself. Her doctor advised her to go to the ER but she's broke so the only thing she could think of was to go to me so she can stop harming herself. I can't let her come because I live with my parents and siblings. There's no room for her here. Instead, I told her to wait for me. I took a quick shower, packed a bag and went to her (she's 23KM away). I was supposed to take an Uber but my brother saw me, took pity on me and drove me since it was already late. I had WFH the next day so I packed my work laptop too.\n\nWhen I got there, first thing I did was I hugged her tight. We cried/bawled. She had wounds all over her arms (she used her razor, like she's shaving off her skin). We sat on her mattress. I cleaned her wounds (they were bleeding but not very deep so we didn't go to the ER). I was so surprised to find that there were more wounds under her skirt, on the side of her thighs. After cleaning her wounds I fed her soup from home. I don't remember much after that. The morning after I bought her breakfast and we both tried to go to work. \n\nFast forward to I told the rest of the group what happened. We talked to her therapist as a group. More episodes happened. She was almost admitted to a facility. Etcetera. Finally convinced her to leave her stressful government job. Of course, this caused more anxiety. Through all of her unemployment I was there for her. She'd call me crying, feeling like a failure after job interviews. We'd make lists together (making lists calms her down). We lent her money. It became a habit of hers to tell me everything she's going through, but she doesn't share it to the group. She tried, but she'd eventually end up with me. \n\nFast forward to Feb 2021, she got a new job. Was mighty proud of her. Felt optimistic. April 2021, M, our married, pregnant friend migrated to the States. Months later, B, the teacher, announced she'd be taking an MBA abroad. Oct 2021, D, the  one closest to me, announced she's also taking an MBA abroad. Suddenly, everyone was leaving and I felt trapped because it'll literally just be L and me.\n\nTo be fair, L doesn't involve M, B and D at all when it comes to her mental health issues. L has had a LOT of other depressive episodes and anxiety attacks that only I know. I nurse her. I ride the attacks with her (via call). Seems like what we went through the night she harmed herself brought us closer in a way that I didn't expect. And she doesn't have the same level of trust (?) or vulnerability with the others. So I also ask myself, why be mad at our friends? L doesn't involve them in anything. How can they help? But then I'd also say, isn't it a good friend's job to ask? To reach out? But they all got their own problems too like a newborn baby and pooling money for MBA. Me? I'm not doing anything important, so I should be the one to take care of her, right? \n\nI thought about vomitting my feelings to M, B and D. But I go back to the \"they have their own things they're dealing with\" so it never happens and the feeling of being trapped intensifies. \n\nThese days I try my best to accept. Accept that this is the role that I've committed myself into the night I went to her when she harmed herself. Now I give her daily wake up calls because she just. couldn't. wake. up. by. herself. and if she wakes up late, her entire day will be completely off (she'll feel rushed, like she wasn't able to do anything for herself before work). She's already apologized for this. She feels ashamed that she can't wake up on her own but swears that she IS trying. The reality of taking care of someone with a mental health problem is really hitting me now - questioning progress, getting impatient, getting angry, waiting for the next episode that I'm SURE is going to happen, then we start all over again. Things like that. Sometimes, I admit I become passive aggressive out of EXTREME frustration. Then immediately regret it and go back to \"this is hormonal imbalance, it's chemistry, it's harder to fight, I should help her.\"\n\nI think I'm rambling but I hope someone gets it. I can never say this to our mutual friends because it's evil and I can't get angry at them for pursuing the things they are pursuing. I'm thinking, I'm here because I chose to take care of her and that's that. \n\nI know this is already depressing and pathetic, but I just wanted to put it out there that I have my own shit too (way before L's 2020 episode). Nothing as important as a marriage, a child, or a higher degree, but I hate myself and I don't see myself living that long. I'm not asking for more pity or encouragement (?). To me this is a fact that I'm starting to really accept (I don't know how else to explain). I just wanted to say this to the universe: tired. This sister is tired.",

I had a full time job but I lost it because I cannot deliver work up to boss' expectations. I now live solely only on my savings at a hostel where I have my own quiet space  and privacy but the rent is depleting my savings rapidly.\n\nDue  to my  social anxiety, I am unable to find jobs to sustain myself for over 6  months as I can't take up any jobs that requires me to work  fast/attend  to  customers/speak to people, even minor responsibilities  like asking   patrons to not touch/do this or that thing at a store freaks me out. I  have to turn down multiple jobs given by career coaches and they are  starting to think that I am not trying hard enough to help myself or  that I am not really eager for money and wasting their time.\n\nContrary  to what they think, I really do need the money. And I need to have a job before may this year. I really do not want to  end up  sleeping at the streets furthermore rape cases has been on the  rise  and I fear for myself. But I just find it very hard to go into a  job that I know will potentially worsen my social anxiety further and I  know that because I had horrible experience in retail/food/events promotion where I know  these places I won't do well in but these are the only jobs available.\n\nUltimately  I want to have a full time job doing what I  majored in. However the industry I majored in is also very volatile. Nobody ever stays in one company for long which is bad for me because I do not want to go through the process of finding jobs, writing resume/cover letter and then going for interviews where I know I will perform very badly. Since I'm a fresh grad now, maybe people will be more lenient if I'm awkward at an interview but 5-6years down the road, there will be no excuses why I am still so socially anxious/awkward.\n\nNobody  understands why I am always so scared of applying for jobs and I really do not  know how to get  out of the mess I  am in other than making faceless/voiceless youtube videos which that  would also need a lot of  time to build but then if I  don't start now,  there's no saying when I  am able to get money. I have  no friends nor  relatives who are willing  to provide me accommodation or help. I  am so at lost  i don't know what to do. I am so torn to the point that if my life savings depletes to $\\_\\_, I am just going to spent it on a nice hotel and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ to end it all.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe reddit group with the specific condition that I have won't let me post so I'm posting here.Would appreciate if the comments comes from person with social anxiety issues as well, as saying things like people won't care about you, it's just one time interaction, etc, does not help. I had colleagues who remembered all the mistakes I made at food/retail years ago and still bring it all up to their friends to mock me when they bump into me.",

    "text": "I haven't really struggled this bad since my early twenties (I am mid 30's now) and genuinely believed that I had overcome the worst of this. The stress of my current situation(s) seems to have exacerbated these issues to the point of a regression. \n\nNo need to go into massive detail; 1st and foremost, my mum has recently had a cancer diagnosis and is having surgery in a few weeks.. the gut punching worry is beyond words. My mum is my best friend and my best support. I got dismissed from my job in Jan for (accidentally) breaking my work lap top then had to leave a new job shortly after because it involved being on a factory floor and I got too close to a machine. Went to town on that, pushed maybe 4 or 5 random buttons and they had to stop the production on that machine to recalibrate because i'd balls'd it up. Had to then explain some things and a mutual decision was made that it would be better for me to not work there.\n\nMy 'thought tics' are becoming bolder, like trying to lash the puppet strings on me. It's mostly harmless, not destructive, but still very unpleasant. The main thing is buttons / switches of any kind and the compulsion to press, turn, flick on or off. I think I am ruining our kettle. Twitching a lot in my legs and feet and started to stretch my fingers out, which isn't something I've done for quite a while. \n\nI will be speaking with the GP tomorrow about this escalation - i've never really medicated it apart from a brief spell on blood pressure meds but stopped after about a week because the dizziness was just too difficult. Pushing all the buttons in the house is preferable to debilitating vertigo type stuff. \n\nThe worst thing is throwing stuff - it isn't compulsive in action, I make a conscious decision to do it, but the thought is not controllable and it's easier to throw the thing and have my brain shut up then trying to suppress the mental shouting. I haven't broken anything yet, I have some soft toys that mitigate that.\n\nI really need a new job now, I feel sick thinking about it. I don't feel very employable to be honest and that's a real kick to the ego. My confidence is rubbish. \n\nIf you got this far thank you for reading. It's a bit cathartic to spill out to online strangers. Hope you are all keeping safe.",

    "text": "I'm 21. I remember feeling generally depressed and anxious since I was 12. It's gotten worse over the years because of all the developmental and mental health milestones I haven't reached by this age. In addition, the limited joy I used to feel at my usual hobbies faded away, until nearly nothing makes me feel pleasant anymore.\n\nI have tried everything from having a routine/schedule to going to meet ups to trying various hobbies.  I loose interest in my hobbies very quickly because I don't feel like I'm getting much out of them. And then people are another subject all together. I'm generally autistic and awkward, so it's a mix of people rejecting me and me being too anxious and depressed to find people appealing at all.\n\nThe only thing that makes feel actual joy is food. For a few moments albeit, but it feels tangible to me. In fact I have a weight management problem.\n\nI had a deep conversation with my parents the other day about feelings of happiness/joy. We agree that I'm not supposed to feel some earth-shattering dopamine rush from most things, but they told me that people do enjoy simple things like their ride on the bus or their coffee in the morning and their routine, a new person coming into work, going somewhere they've never been before, or that at least they enjoy their hobbies. I don't seem to like anything. All I feel is flat emotion, anxiety and the momentary dopamine rush of food. \n\nI used to think that I had an attitude problem. That I should stop expecting excessive happiness and be grateful for feelings of pleasantness and just appreciate things around me. I have tried positive internal thoughts like 'this is some nice scenery. It's a very lovely village square, it's early in the morning and there's birds chirping'. But my emotions are still flat. I would also get caught in a vicious cycle of having breakdowns then trying to get my shit together by doing something new or purposeful. And every time my emotions are still flat, and I struggle on to remain consistent in the hope that it will eventually get better and result in something better, like a better self-image of a person who has their shit together. But it never does.\n\nI used to look forward to traveling, even if in the background of my mind I could picture myself in the most spectacular of places, and feeling nearly nothing. And it actually happened. I went on a day trip and had an utterly awful time. My stomach was burning for the entire time and wouldn't let up until I got back home, and I got ear barotrauma again. Along with my mask and glasses fogging up it made for a nearly unbearable sensory experience, and made it nearly impossible to eat or talk or concentrate. I didn't know anyone in the tour group, and their loudness and let's say trashy attitudes and kind of starting fights with the locals made my feelings worse. \n\nMy parents say they would have really enjoyed the place even though they've been their before. I had only like 2 positive thoughts on the trip. I simply thought 'the views are nice I guess', and liked watching the peaceful cows and magpies.\n\nAnd that's when I realised maybe that this wasn't an attitude or discipline problem.\n\nI'm 21 years old. I have no real friends. I have no tangible coping strategies, no tangible hobbies, nothing that really makes me feel joy. I can never really relate when other people feel and express real joy or happiness. I just go along with it and try to copy them, but I never seem to feel what they feel, especially for relatively 'simple' things like nice lights and views and going somewhere a bit different.\n\nI have tried medications before but they were with a very sketchy psychiatrist. And now I'm looking to try them again because people are telling me that there's clearly something very missing in my brain's chemistry. Except I still have the old mentality that it probably won't work because it's probably an attitude/discipline problem.",

    "text": " \n\nTo my bestest of best of friends!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Dear Nostalgia, I love you but hate you so much! You always remind me of the good and happy times we used to have, and all the fun things we did together. How sad that we can no longer do it anymore. And when you go, I'm left feeling unhappy, because I can never feel my pure unfiltered happiness again! Oh, you. Sometimes, you even make me feel nostalgia for a time I was never in, always teasing me of a better childhood that I could have had. Sometimes, you just tease what I could be doing right now, but yet seemed so long ago. Ah, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be so regretful right now!   Dear Hatred, how far we have come. We used to be friends only because we shared a similar interest, our dislike for those normies! But now, that's all in the past. The only person I now hate is myself! Ah, you've influenced me in so many ways I didn't imagine possible. Remember that time you made me spite someone important to me, just because he wasn't fit? Or the time you made me insult someone just because they were having too much fun on something you didn't like? Those truly were the days. But it's all better now. Because of you, I've learnt that they weren't wrong, they were having fun! The only one who wasn't, was me! And now, the only hate I have left is for myself. Fun! \n\nDear Envy, we haven't always been the bestest of friends. When we were young, I had everything! And so, I never found the need to be your friend. In fact, I was always the best! Because what everyone else had was always the worst. What everyone else had was always not as good as mine. And I believed it! Ah, silly me, to think that I used to be like that. But now, we're best buddies aren't we? Every time I see someone else on the gram, you come to my side. Every time in public, we would watch the couples go together, as we pretended not to look. Oh, better still, when everyone else was having fun, and you came by to watch. We clearly have had plenty of fun times recently, and even now you still refuse to go away! What can I say, we are just that close.   Dear Pride, you have always been my childhood friend. Since a young age, we've conquered miles together! We've looked down on others, we've laughed at them, and we've bullied them. What a thrill, that was! What fun we had, holding a trophy up high, thinking no one was our equal. How I miss those days. The days where I could blindly believe I was the king of them all, and didn't need to make a single friend. But even though we haven't been so close lately, the occasional whisper in\u00a0 my ear still scares me a lot, you know? When I was so desperately calling for help, you insisted otherwise, because I wouldn't look good, and masculine! When I so desperately wanted to make friends with them, you pulled me back, saying I shouldn't associate with losers! When I was ready to end it all, you told me to do it in private. Don't want to go looking like one of those attention seeking whores, do you?\n\nDear regret, it was only recently that we were acquainted. It was only when I realized what a short time we have on this place that you came along. And what a meeting it was! We discussed so many things, like the time I could have become close friends if I had taken the first step, the time I could have helped a friend who so desperately needed it, or the time where I could've forgiven someone so close and dear to me. We discussed all the happy ends we could've taken together, and lament over why we never took it. Why it had to lead to this bad end. It was a blast, really. So many sleepless nights, as we had back and forths about the different life I could be living right now! They say I'm the only one who remembers my own regrets, and that's true. No one else really cares about what happened to me, do they? No they don't! You are my close friend in this regard, regret. And don't you forget it.   Dear Expectations, what a wonderous road we've had. So many times we've set our dreams together, dreaming of the highs and lows we would gleefully overcome. Of all the experiences we saw in our shows we watched together, and of all the things our friends went through. It was such a fun time! But where did you go, when it all came crashing down? When nothing was met? When I ended the years, alone, scared, crying and frightened? When I ended the year with the knife in my hand? RUDE! Then you come back once I'm feeling up again, and try to set new dreams? You have to be with me all the way man! Remember, friends go through thick and thin together!\n\nDear anxiety. Thank you for being constantly by my side. Thank you for constantly giving me your second opinion about everything. About how my friends could all be posers. About how people were talking to me out of spite. About how the love they gave me, was just for my money. Without you, my life would've gone very differently, and I thank you for that. You were always there when I was happy, to make sure that I felt unhappy and down. You were always there for me when I got close to someone, to prepare me for that betray that never came. You were always there when I met someone new, someone who wanted to be my friend, and reminded me that you were probably never their first choice. And never will be. You were always there, old friend. From the very start, to the very end. And I don't know how to repay you for it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to Celeste, the one I see in my dreams. How I wish you could become real, and listen to me all those times when I needed you to be. How I wish those happy days we travelled the road were not an illusion, but a happy memory I could cherish. How I wish that after I am done here, we can meet in the eternity beyond.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n And how I wish that someone just like you, was in this world, waiting for me. Like you always did, when I needed you.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now my dear friends, I must go. Have I missed anyone? I doubt it. There is no one else who would appreciate such a note, and I don't want to hassle them with it.   \n\nOh, maybe I should send one to my maker!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *After all, I will be seeing him soon. Very, very, very soon.*",

They stopped my binge eating habit, but as of curing depression and anxiety, I don\u2019t really feel much. One of the medication (Prozac) is already at the 60mg dose, which should be effective by now. \n\nHe also prescribed me with oxcarbazepine and clonazepam, while I felt clonazepam is very effective on lessening my anxiety, I got scared when I was browsing the sub and found out if used long-term I might get dangerous addictions. So I\u2019m scared to use it on a daily basis now. I went back to self-harming when I felt anxious, which was exactly what I did before I took any medications. So that wasn\u2019t really helping either.\n\nI have to drive 3 hours in total to see this psychiatrist every time and my mom is suggesting I find someone near me. Plus every session he only sees me about 10 minutes, ask how I felt and continues the prescription, then the session is done. My mom doesn\u2019t think he is very responsible.\n\nBut finding new psychiatrist is very difficult for me, because telling a new psychiatrist about my problems again would be a pain in the butt, I got super distressed last time I tried to do that that so I stayed with this psychiatrist even though I don\u2019t trust him 100%. Plus it seems very soon to find a new psychiatrist when I\u2019ve only been seeing him for three months.\n\nShould I stay with this psychiatrist or should I find a new one near me?

    "text": "Little bit of history. My journey with mental health started with seeking an ADHD diagnosis in 2016 after what i realize now being bed ridden for 2 weeks (because of a one way romantic breakup)which was most likely depression but it made me think about my whole life and I got to the realization that I had ADHD and went and got diagnosed with it by a NP and put on adderall. Life was great for about 6 month and adderall made me feel truly like myself and able to reach my potential. It felt like I had glasses on for my brain for the first time and all the other metaphors ADHDers use. This was great until the adderall crashes started in the evening and I would be great in the morning but at night when the adderall wears off I go back to those 2 weeks of depression that I mentioned times x3. I researched on reddit (damn you reddit) and found that smoking marijuana eases that pain. That\u2019s when things started going downhill.\n\nI began a cycle of taking my adderall and smoking at night, which developed to even smoking in the morning sometimes even on my adderall and while it made me feel great it was just total reliance on both and I couldn\u2019t function without them. I was an awful human being without them. Fast forward to the end of 2017 I\u2019m about to graduate and decided I should stop both, and maybe smoke occasionally if needed. I was good for about 3 months until in the spring of 2018 I experienced a psychosis that caused me to be hospitalized. I was in the psych ward for 2 weeks and couldn\u2019t really get diagnosed properly cuz I wouldn\u2019t talk b/c I thought the hospital people were my enemies and shit, typical psychosis stuff. But I was put on haldol and after calming down I was diagnosed with a drug-induced psychosis cuz there was weed in my pee.\n\nThat\u2019s when my real mental health crisis truly started and got put on medications. Haldol was awful, it gave me terrible akathesia that I still have to this day. I was always in pain and not myself. I decided to start working again at the end of 2018 which lasted only 4 months going into 2019. Halfway in I couldn\u2019t take it and started smoking again but nothing bad happened no psychosis or anything but I didn\u2019t like that i was dependent on it again since it didn\u2019t even make me feel good like it used to, just paranoid and hungry. My mom told me about this program back in my home country since she saw how miserable i was and I decided to go. Turned out it was an inpatient hospital that treat substance use and addiction issues but I thought i was going for depression. I\u2019m not denying I have addiction tendencies but the main reason I do is because of my depression. I was put on a cocktail of medications like abilify, lamictal, strattera, effexor etc. and couldn\u2019t still get a clear diagnoses but they put on my chart mood disorder, impulse disorder, and personality disorder(borderline). The head doctor even assured me that I do not have bipolar disorder or anything and just depression and substance use issues. I stayed there for about 3-4 months and was released and I was still not good so I decided to try lsd for it\u2019s therapeutic effects (again thanks reddit \ud83d\ude44). It immediately put me in a temporary psychosis for a day but after the effects were gone I was back to normal. I worked for about a month in marketing while back home but again got fed up and bored and quit. Now after the summer of 2019 ended I wanted to come back to the states and resume my life even though I was still not 100%. I came back and throughout the end of 2019 and 2020 I stopped my medications because they weren\u2019t helping and started smoking again. Again nothing bad happened but I was just a lazy stoner unemployed piece of shit for a year.\n\nAt the end of 2020 I decided to get my act together. I stopped smoking since it wasn\u2019t helping me at all just numbing the pain and decided to get a part time job and just accept life as what it is. Things were great for 3 months, I was full of hope and energy and motivation for the first time in 4 years. No adderall no weed nothing at all. Then all of a sudden I went into another psychosis in  march around the same time I had my first one back in 2018. Police came and took me to the hospital and I got fired from my job. I went out of the hospital but I was still in psychosis so a month later went back in. Now that\u2019s when I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I was put on invega shots and came out the hospital. Now fast forward again, I spent months not feeling well just very depressed and suicidal. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m back seeing a psychiatrist which put me on Vraylar(been on it for 2 weeks now) and I\u2019m feeling much better not really depressed or suicidal, have more motivation and physical energy but no mental energy. That\u2019s where my question lies. I keep thinking about ADHD and adderall again and how it could help me If i start on it again and take it as prescribed. But I feel like there\u2019s something else wrong with me. Like i think if i take it maybe I\u2019d be fine for the duration i\u2019m on it and be calm and collected and motivated, but when it wears off I don\u2019t know.. I feel like my brain is broken. It\u2019s like there\u2019s something constantly on my mind but I don\u2019t know what it is. I still have to do ADHD testing to be able to maybe be put on adderall but even if I really want it, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m afraid of myself. I\u2019m on both Vraylar and Zoloft but the zoloft ain\u2019t doing shit. Only Vraylar started helping. I\u2019m coming into terms with accepting my bipolar diagnoses since the times I felt really good before my psychosis were really just mania, plus the doctor explained that mania occurs in many ways one of which is psychosis. But regardless of all of that I don\u2019t know what to do and what will help me to feel fine. I\u2019m craving the adderall only because I\u2019ve tried it before and miss the calmness it gave me in my head but I\u2019m afraid of the repercussions. I\u2019m all over the place with this text so I\u2019ll end this year. Please let me know your thoughts.",

Since age 6, I\u2019ve been on a downward spiral. When I was 8, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety. At age 15, I began to cut myself, and I seriously considered suicide for the first time. The only reason I didn\u2019t off myself is because I didn\u2019t want my mom to find me. She died a few years ago.\n\nA few months ago, I again considered killing myself. I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t want my dad to find me. Also, at the time, my brother and aunt died, within weeks of each other. I figured that he couldn\u2019t take any more pain. I checked myself into a mental hospital. That place was a complete joke. The staff didn\u2019t know what the fuck they were doing. After 8 days, I lied and said I was feeling better. I spent about 11 days there.\n\nI\u2019ve been on testosterone for 5 years. I pass as male, and have a consultation for top surgery. But I will never have a genuine male body, and that hurts. I want to rip my skin off.\n\nI\u2019m living with a friend right now, and I\u2019m desperately trying to hold on. After almost 5 months, I relapsed on self harm. When I told her, she was frightened, to say the least. I promised her that I wouldn\u2019t do it again. But that was literally the only coping mechanism that worked. I\u2019ve tried at least six different meds for depression. They either didn\u2019t work, made me feel numb, or only worked for a few weeks.\n\nI have everything to look forward to. I literally have no reason to be depressed or suicidal. I shouldn\u2019t want to cut myself. Objectively speaking, my life is going well. Yet, here I am.\n\nI\u2019m an empty husk of a human being.

I\u2019m quiet and reserved. I feel sometimes that I\u2019m not sure who I really am because it\u2019s too complex for me to grasp. I am not entirely sure of what I\u2019m capable of and have continuously pushed that envelope. \n\nI suffered from severe mental illness and psychosis in my early 29\u2019s which really changed my course and was a culmination of what I think is all of me. But also, it wasn\u2019t really me either. I have been in handcuffs dozens of times, I\u2019ve done nearly every popular drug except heroin and meth. I took police on a chase after stealing gas, bashing cars out of my way to escape only to end up stuck teetering on railroad tracks.I wrote a book about my experience with mental illness and my victory over it, at least so far.\n\nI\u2019ve had police pull out their guns on me multiple times. I have sought out danger and trouble and the opposite. I bought crack in the ghettos of Chicago while looking like a lanky tall white guy with dorky 1980\u2019s style glasses. I\u2019ve done drive with prostitutes looking for a high the same as me. I\u2019ve gotten robbed, I\u2019ve hung out and partied with low level gang bangers, as well as some mildly famous people, athletes and millionaires.  I took someone hostage who must\u2019ve weighed twice as much as me in a mental ward in a bid to escape, I ended up getting tackled by the team of nurses and the guy I tackled showed up to the ward with a cast the next day. I\u2019ve gotten into bar fights, in jail I stayed in solitary confinement in a cell directly next to a notorious child killer. I dropped out of college, but played basketball as bad football with ex ncaa div 1 basketball players who absolutely lit me up but I was a decent player nonetheless. I once talked a 350lb semi pro football player from Canada. He was a lineman but in the game I played against him they used him as a running back because he was so huge and hard to tackle. I\u2019ve weighed 180-190 lbs my whole full grown life and I\u2019m 6\u20192.  I\u2019ve gotten bullied in school for being skinny and abused verbally and physically by my otherwise loving but crazy ass old school dad who was old enough to be my grandpa and grew up in the Great Depression.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest of 14 half brothers s as of half sisters. One of which is mentally handicapped, one died in Vietnam so I never got to meet him, and another ran for mayor of Chicago against Harold Washington as a democrat and never had a chance. He was murdered in the city a few years later for possibly being gay.  I have subsequently disowned my family after Jan 6th as they ended up being fascist traitors to our democracy  who continued to support trump, and as such, fascism.  One of my older cousins was a populist who smuggled drugs into Miami for Escobars cartel, I met him and he was actually a great guy.\n\n The first time I really gambled I was high on coke with someone showing me how to play blackjack that I met through a mutual friend that night. I don a bunch of money, he lost all of his. We were up all night til daylight. He begged me for more money, but he lost way too much already. Leaving the casino was like hell, seeing the sun and hearing birds while crashing down from a huge cocaine high. \n\nI\u2019m a fucking animal. Once I went out by myself to the city to party, I ended up getting so drunk I forgot where I parked my car. In order to not wonder the streets anymore I went back into a bar desperate to find someone to fuck, and it had to be at her place. Pretty sure I spent most of my money  at that point, so I was desperate. I found a girl, and was hitting on her pretty good while playing pool, but her friend was flirting with me more, so I directed my focus on her. I really angered the other girl and she became visibility upset, but I needed a sure thing. She took me home, and luckily knew someone who had a car because she didn\u2019t.y plan worked, the next morning she drove me around to find my car. \n\nI\u2019m a professional who nearly makes 6 figures doing production scheduling and planning for manufacturers and I have experience in operations management and typically push everyone for process improvements, and consistently get very good raises and bonuses. I\u2019m married (for 18 years) and have two children, they helped save me from mental illness and my wife has been the reason I have gotten my life together. I enjoy philosophy and write a blog about it.  I\u2019m afraid of my future. I feel I\u2019m always pushing my limits, and I have the same feeling I get before doing something extreme and possibly reckless, or possibly beneficial. I am craving a thrill again.

In the past ive had counselling and it was more of a sit down play games, chat about school and leave. Whereas now because im 20 years old, its pure conversation on my problems, thoughts etc. I am not sure what CBT is totally, and whether or not i should get that as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy job is currently working at the airport on the ramp, the shift times are shit. 4 on 2 off is pretty tough on my sleep schedule. 28th March i start at my old company again at the airport with a better shift time, 3 on 3 off. Still a mixture of earlies and lates however. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy goals for the rest of this half of the year, are to get round to tidying my room, making a PC setup possibly and Continuing on with my crypto investments.",

My wife can express their gender identity and sexuality at work (kids know pronouns and their laptop background is our wedding photo) and I absolutely can\u2019t, and it is the worst thing for my mental health. I have gender issues I can\u2019t pursue because of my career, and 5 local therapists have turned me down. Living in Texas it\u2019s hard not to hate myself, because I feel like everyone here hates me. I feel like I don\u2019t/won\u2019t fit in, other teachers look at me weird because I don\u2019t fit that cookie cutter. My admin has told me not to share with students and to change the subject if I\u2019m asked directly. On top of everything else wrong with teaching and the incredible amount of stress at my job, I feel like a failure and like I\u2019m at a breaking point. It\u2019s so isolating and soul crushing, but the salary here is decent, my subject isn\u2019t taught in every state, and my wife is so happy at their job.

    "text": "\nIt was all because of my pet bird. \n\nMy dad drenched my bird with coffee and I lost it, I cried and yelled and everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to say I said. I screamed how they never listen to me and when my dad said \u201cokay I\u2019ll just go on a ride I don\u2019t like being here\u201d I replied with \u201cI don\u2019t like being here more.\u201d\n\nSee like, things were getting better at home. Compared to when I was a kid, they never hit me, they try listening to me more, they cuss at me less, but all the wounds are still there. And I don\u2019t know why the fuck I\u2019m still holding on to those, because if they ask me \u201cwhen did we ever mistreat you\u201d and I say \u201coh back when I was 12 you chased me around the house in front of my family with the stick of a broom and kept hitting me and didn\u2019t apologize\u201d I would sound fucking dumb. And I understood that they never hit more than supposed to? Like it\u2019s the generational hit your child to discipline them kind of thing, but I didn\u2019t take it very well. I\u2019m fucking 19 and still screaming and crying to my parents, and now they will be walking on eggshells around me.\n\nFor context, they used to hit or cuss whenever I\u2019m misbehaving as a child, and I vividly remember my dad used to count my mistakes as I\u2019m practicing the piano with an angry tone, for which the aftermath now I can\u2019t play whenever I can sense anyone is around me, because I will berate myself to hell and cry for no reason. I should\u2019ve taken it better than I do now though. I have an older brother and he fucking turned out fine. \n\nI was assaulted by my cousin for over ten years and nobody knew. He would do it in the car near my parents or his parents or his driver and nobody would notice. Sometimes I think I still have a grudge on everyone over this because I showed all the signs and nobody ever fucking noticed, leading my head to believe nobody actually pays attention. I whined \u201cno stop\u201d A LOT in the car, I remember bleeding in the toilet as a kid and my mom was there, I asked my parents if it\u2019s alright to marry my cousin (that cousin specifically), my dad noticed I\u2019m becoming more gloomy as I grow up but blamed it on my friends\u2014I showed all the signs, but nobody noticed. Now I feel like I\u2019m alone, I feel like I\u2019m secluded from my family, I feel better eating alone or at separate tables, I hate being hugged or kissed by my parents. Sometimes my dad would joke (or not) that I don\u2019t love my parents because I wouldn\u2019t hug and kiss them, and it would shoot right through me even if he\u2019s joking because it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t love him, it\u2019s because I fucking hate being touched, but I can\u2019t fucking tell him that, he doesn\u2019t know about my cousin. So now what? \n\nMy parents aren\u2019t even bad parents. They give me whatever I want, they enrolled me in one of the best schools in my city, they enrolled me to the best program in my current university, and they try so hard to grant me whatever I wished. Sometimes though, it\u2019s the little things that rile me up (that shouldn\u2019t). Things like calling me hotheaded and stupid when I can\u2019t drive a car properly when I was learning, like being noisy when I told them to stay quiet when I practice piano (to which they don\u2019t understand why, they just think I can\u2019t focus when it\u2019s literally triggering for me), like telling others what I\u2019ve told them when I\u2019ve said don\u2019t tell anyone (it\u2019s not a serious topic usually, but it makes me feel like my privacy is being breached), and things like this, my birds. Now I feel like I\u2019m making excuses for myself.\n\nLast year a similar thing happened, but before I could lash out and yell every vile thing from my mouth, I retreated to my room and coped with it by myself. My dad took my birds and dumped them in a tall bucket of water expecting them to splash away to save their lives, and simply said \u201cI\u2019m just making them take a bath.\u201d When I told him he can\u2019t do that, they\u2019ll die, he\u2019ll literally ask what he\u2019s done wrong. He puts chocolate and other weird stuff on their food bowl a lot too, but I just take it out and internalize my anger, now I saw my birds literally drenched in black coffee, and I freaking lost it. I got angry and said this has happened before, and my dad\u2019s first words were \u201cstop acting like you\u2019re deranged.\u201d Which looking back, maybe I am. Maybe I am overreacting. It\u2019s not fucking worth lashing out like that when my mom literally went to my room and cried and said I have hurt her feelings and as parents they always give me whatever I want. So I fucking said, yeah no, it\u2019s not your fault, I just don\u2019t take things well. It ended with \u201cdon\u2019t treat your parents like that, we didn\u2019t raise you to be so angry.\u201d\n\nI fucking hate conflict. I would rather hurt and stay with my off myself ideation and sh and negative thoughts than have my parents know anything is wrong and make me talk to them. Now that I\u2019ve lashed out that huge, which I\u2019ve never done before, they\u2019re suspecting something is behind all this OR I\u2019m just an ungrateful child who keeps disrespecting their parents. From what she said, I took it as she feels hurt I\u2019m like this when they\u2019ve tried their best being great parents. Which they have. Now i feel fucking guilty and I want to off myself more.\n\nBefore this, I thought things were getting better. I\u2019m so tired. I seriously don\u2019t know what to do. I want to just off myself and avoid all of life altogether.\n\nI literally feel like a child. At this age I shouldn\u2019t be crying from every little things my parents say, I should be preparing to live on my own, I should have proper sleep schedule, I shouldn\u2019t mope so much I don\u2019t feel like showering or eating or brushing my teeth. This was a problem too. My parents don\u2019t think anything is wrong with me (before this, maybe), so anytime I\u2019m on an episode and don\u2019t go showering for days my mom will hit me with a \u201cgo shower, you\u2019re disgusting\u201d and I\u2019d take it to heart while she thinks it\u2019s funny. \n\nI\u2019m so tired. It\u2019s so much easier when this is a problem that existed solely in my head rather than out there where my parents now blame both me and themselves and everyone feels guilty and I feel more of a burden than I\u2019ve ever felt before in my life.",

What am I doing with my life now?\n\nI threw away everything I valued and loved about my life for some guy that can\u2019t even be honest with me on a consistent basis. For a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me. For a guy who just doesn\u2019t understand me even though he likes to act like he does. I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid.\n\nAnd you wanna know what the worst part is? I don\u2019t think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make $400 a month now. I\u2019m not only broke, I\u2019m in severe debt now. Things will never be the same. Because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was 18. I guess I can\u2019t even do that right. I\u2019m quite literally good for nothing. I should\u2019ve done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. \n\nI don\u2019t even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I can\u2019t even be mad at him. I did it to myself.",

    "text": "So, over the last few weeks I was in a non commital relationship with someone I've had a crush on for a long time. (We started out cuddling, then a little bit more, but basically all SFW.) I just came out of a relationship a few months earlier and am not quite super stable yet (it was the first time for me that I initiated the breakup and I took quite a hit to my mental stability). \n\nA bit about them: They are in a different kind of non-commital (more a not-fully-commital) long distance relationship with their ex, and have also taken a bit of a hit to their mental stability because of a romantic non-incident where they imagined things would have gone differently, if they had behaved differently and it was some sort of love at first sight moment. So not ideal circumstances to start any sort of relationship. \n\nWe (the non-commital and I) had talked about our relationship several times and I think they understood from the beginning that I wanted a bit more of it, but we still agreed to trying staying non-commital. And in the beginning I was OK with our arrangement and it even helped me, gain a bit of stability back, connecting me back to myself. A connection that remains better since then. But then a few days back they had just come back from a weekend with their LDR and needed a lot of time for themselves to readjust, and also just had a weekend with their other relationship so the need for physical closeness (and also non-physical) was a lot less than mine. And it bugged me, and it bugged me, that I basically was just the number 2. Of course I understood it and still do, since they have a much deeper connection to their ex, with whom they had a relationship for 1 or 2 years, than with me, when our friendship really just started a few months ago (And then developed into something more physical weeks ago) but it still hurt a lot. And combined with them needing a bit time for themselves it did bad things to my mental health, probably mostly because most of my friends are not in town for a few weeks because of semester break and I had very little else to do. And I was also physically hurt a bit which I assume also promoted a bit of a fight or flight reflex. \n\nSo the next weekend I was upset and cancelled a meeting we had because they invited someone to that meeting, even though they had asked me before if it was ok. Which obviosly hurt them and upset them, so they asked for a bit of a time out themselves. That again gave me a lot of time to think about things and was not good for my mental stability... because I kept thinking about the worst scenarios and once you think them you can't unthink them however unlikely you rationally deem them. \n\nSo last Friday we talked again and decided to basically break up, but didn't quit the contact, because we share several friendship groups and it would be awkward and also we like each other a lot... And we had a very nice evening. \n\nBut of course it still hurts, I still miss them every moment I'm not with them and (they had a different cuddle buddy in the same town before) I'm assuming I've probably already been replaced as a cuddle buddy and that hurts even more. Because I'm depriving myself of something I want and need, because if I didn't do that it would hurt me even more. And even if I've not yet been replaced, to know that they can just replace me like that because they don't have the emotional connection to me that I had to them hurts a lot. And I basically feel like if either I or the world could explode right now that would be greatly appreciated.",

I try to be there when they need it but the way they talk really triggers my own mental health issues.\nThey also seem to lie a lot so I\u2019m never sure what to believe. When I say a lot I mean no story is ever told even close to the same twice. \nThe suicidal comments always seem to happen when I take a few days break away from them. To me, it comes across as a manipulative way to get my attention. However, I don\u2019t want to not take the suicide comments serious so whenever I get them I always am quick to act/respond. \n\nWe have an age difference- they are 20. I\u2019m 34. We met through a chronic pain support group. \nThey don\u2019t have other friends to fall back on, so I feel guilty completely pulling away.\nMost recently, my friend is telling me many different stories about being SA\u2019d. Again, the stories are never even close to being consistent. Every week it\u2019s a new story of SA experience that happened to them. This is after me opening up about my SA so the inconsistency in their stories is very triggering to me. \nThe most recent was of them on a date, they ended up having consensual sex. Then the guy ghosted her. Several days later she is now telling people that she was actually SA\u2019d but the story of events has drastically changed from 1 hr to the next. The text convos we have had don\u2019t match at all. \nAt this point, I don\u2019t want this friendship anymore. It gives me horrible anxiety but also anger? \nHowever, I fear if I end the friendship that they will harm themselves.",

    "text": "*TW* --&gt; if your OCD is bad to where your OCD might get ideas of what to obsess over from my OCD, you should scroll. I don't wanna give anyone new fears. \n.\n(Please read, I need your help)\n.\n.\n.\nMy OCD sometimes manifests itself physically. For example, when I was younger I all of a sudden had this obsession with swallowing food and I could barely get myself to swallow anything because I felt like I was going to choke. That lasted for a few weeks. I also went through a phase where I had to be drinking water 24/7 because I would feel like I was going to throw up if I didn't. That lasted for a year or two. \n\nAfter medication and therapy, I'm doing pretty well; except for this one last physical manifestation I can't seem to shake. So, I loved to swim. In the summer, I would swim every day, all day. I kid you not, it used to be my favorite thing to do. So when I was in middle school and high school, I was on our school swim team, and in high school, something changed. One day during practice I felt like my foot was going to cramp up. I ignored it and tried to keep swimming but for some reason it was just really bothering me. Then, I felt the sensation every practice after that, always in the same foot. I was never afraid of my foot cramping up before, but I was now. Idk foot cramps for me have always been super painful, like, I can look down and can see my toes separating because of how tight the tendon gets when it cramps. Anyways, I started really worrying about it and every time my foot would cramp up after that it just made me even more afraid of feet cramps. It just got worse and worse to where I could only practice for a certain amount of time before my leg muscles would start spasing. Then the amount of time I could be in the water got shorter and shorter until I could only swim a lap and then my muscles would start spasing. I tried to keep swimming for a year and a half after that but then I just had to quit (I didn't know it was OCD yet) ((Dory would be disappointed)). I got the the point where even just putting my one foot in water would make it spasm. I was having anxiety attacks before practice and I would stress about going to practice all the time, it was just too much. Once I got diagnosed with OCD I would try and do exposures in my bathtub, the beach, the pool, whenever I was around water, but I couldn't do it consistently enough to where I got actual results. I lowkey mourn swimming sometimes, but I've learned to live without my favorite hobby.\n\nSometimes I think the fact that the cramping is only related to one foot goes back to the time I fell off my bike and really injured that same foot to where I could barely move it without it hurting and had to wear bandages for a year BUT one can only guess. I'm not afraid of bikes. \n\nAnd I KNOW this shit is psychological because I CAN FEEL the same phantom-like sensation in my one foot whenever I think about swimming or it cramping up. \n\nThe point is, I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what they've done about it, if anything. I want to know if I'm not alone in this. \n\nThanks for reading this.\n\n(I put this on the OCD subreddit to see if anyone has experienced something similar to me and to see what they did to treat it but nobody could help me. I figured that maybe this was an issue outside of my OCD so I thought I would ask a more general mental health community)",

Mental health treatment here is pretty good but in my home state/area it is pretty bad.so even when I get back home and can use my insurance I feel like I will end up straining my mh more if I get bad treatment.  \n\nLast year I tried a lot of medications until eventually just painfully going cold turkey (I was overwhelmed, nothing was working, and I had to move so I just ghosted my doc and never found a new). I also spent a good portion of the year with the idea of myself having bpd looming over my shoulder (tbh it still is) and me purposely not exploring the idea. I still don't have an official diagnosis, and I'm not going to give into my need to overly disclaim why I believe I have bpd. In short I relate to it's traits heavily and it's the only thing that makes my extremeness make sense. If in the end I don't have it, wtv, I just know i feel BAD. \n\nI almost went to a mental hospital last summer after I went through a really bad episode but ended up not going. Never felt validated enough to go. Even though I got 5150'd I just ended up stuck in the ER for a week and just went home more traumatized then I came in. After the experience (pretty sure it was malpractice but I'm not getting into that here) I just wanted to escape and never be stuck anywhere and terrified to be held against my will. Now I kinda wish I went while i still had the coverage. I really feel like I need that intensive care, I feel like I've needed it for years. But I'm quite \"high functioning\" aka I faked it and held up a front but It has had such a toll on me. My mental health obviously kept getting worse and I'm pretty sure the stress has greatly affected my body as well.\n\nEveryday I'm holding back from spiraling into an episode. Now I don't have the security of insurance that I can use like I did last time I was here. I know bpd is less taboo these days but there is still pretty limited resources for treatment and I feel like all the good ones are expensive or fully booked. I'm scared to get bad treatment because it could cause me to spiral and things to just get worse, and I don't even have the coverage or money for bad service since all medical stuff has to be so freaking expensive.",

    "text": "So I recently got out of a mental hospital about 3 days ago. I went there for having suicidal thoughts and almost attempting. This wasn't my first time going to a hospital. My first mental hospital was 2 weeks before going into that hospital. I went there for just having sucidal thoughts. Life is was too much for me, the stress of life and the pain. I went to that hospital and was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. And was put on medication. The thing that lead me to the second hospital was a break up. I met someone at the first hospital and we liked each other. I thought it would be a good idea to pursue that. (Not a good idea) turns out she has a drinking problem or some other issue, that wasn't present at the hospital. We only talked for like a week over the phone (3 days at the hospital) untill I ended contact. The night I figured out it wasn't going to work out, I was at the gym, trying to get my mind off of her because she was acting weird. I stopped my workout because she kept acting weird and wouldn't tell me why. I eventually knew it wasn't going to work out and I should cut contact. I knew of a bridge next to the gym and headed there with the thought in mind \"why not\" \"what else do I have to live for?\" I broke down and cried, paced, yelled and almost jumped for about an hour. A friend eventually called me because I told him that I couldn't do life anymore and he knew about the situation. He talked me down and made me think of why I shouldn't. The next day I checked myself in to the mental hospital, after almost attempting again that day. It's been about 3 days from getting out of that hospital and I'm doing okay. I am somone who wants to be in a relationship and doesn't like to be single. I know I shouldn't be in a relationship right now. I am clearly not mental stable. The reason I tell you all of this is because I want to know when I should even consider getting into a relationship? How do I know when? Should it be time based? Mentaly based? How do I know I mental stable and ready for a relationship? Btw thank you if you have read to this point and answer my question.",

Simple tasks impossible, simple questions, simple texts, impossible like a writers block, like a wall. Put it off, put it off till all the stress of putting everything off builds up.\n\nIf I don\u2019t think about it, it should be fine right? Until they all build up and everything seems impossible. It\u2019s crippling really. I\u2019m not lazy or forgetful, trust me I don\u2019t forget at all it\u2019s always in the back of my head, taking up space, weighing me down. They stack like bricks heavy and heavier, building a wall. Impossible, no I won\u2019t even think about it. Simple tasks too stressful, too heavy, impossible. Then guilt why can\u2019t I do these simple tasks why are they so heavy so daunting, so threatening?\n\nWhy must I think so much? Why must I create demons who haunt me? Why do I expect perfection from myself but accept others to treat me with disrespect. The problem is myself I have so much hate, so much disgust for myself. I am not perfect and I expect that of myself so I will punish myself, Sabotage myself and invite others into my life who treat me as the vile being I see myself as.\n\nThe standard I set for myself is impossible no one can be perfect, no one is liked by everyone and no one can say/do everything right at the right time/place, no one can be in everyone\u2019s life all the time so why do I feel so guilty for not being able to be there for everyone. I\u2019ve let so many people down, promised I\u2019d be there, I\u2019d call, I\u2019d text, I\u2019d do something. But when the time comes it\u2019s so daunting so threatening it is physically impossible.\n\nI have so much empathy, so much love, so much compassion for people in my life I want them to be happy I want to make them happy I want to be everything they want me to be and more I want to impress them I want to help them with everything. I see others as beautiful, perfect beings, they are perfect to me and I need to be perfect for them.\n\nI constantly put others before myself. They deserve it after all I\u2019m such a vile human I don\u2019t deserve basic needs. I\u2019m selfish, I\u2019m rude, I\u2019m dishonest. I just wish I could be perfect for everyone just as perfect as they are to me. Guilt if I do it, guilt if I don\u2019t. If I call, text, speak they will hate me if I don\u2019t it will pile up and I will feel guilty for not being able to do simple tasks.\n\nHow do I win? It\u2019s a loose, loose guilt around every corner. Even guilt for feeling guilty. Others have it worse than you so WHY am I so stuck up on simple shit? I don\u2019t even deserve the simple shit. I\u2019m vile, disgusting, worthless, like scum of the earth type shit. Why do you even try? You can never win you will never be proud of yourself. How do I not expect so much of myself?

All we did was talk so he could get to know me better, but I'm scared for any future meetings.  I'm just scared about opening up basically.  But I'm mainly scared about telling him about my SH, and certain thoughts I have, along with my voices but everyone has those so I shouldn't be scared.\n\nBasically, I'm in a temporary foster home, until I either get adopted, or my mother takes me back.  N' my current caretaker already knows about my SH, but she doesn't know I have more ways of getting blades.  Whenever she asks I just say I've been clean, cause if I don't she'll take my blades away again.  But I was told that if I am hurting myself my therapist can tell my guardian about it, I don't want that.  I just want someone to talk to about it to SLOWLY help me stop.  Not get my blades taken, it just makes me hurt whenever I don't have them.\n\nWith my certain thoughts, I've always been told, by my mother and others, that I'm most likey gonna end up a serial killer.  They're probably not wrong I guess, I've always wanted to prove them wrong, but day by day I believe it more and more.  I have thoughts of wanting to hurt people, specifically bad people like rapists and pedos, but even then I'll be looked at with disgust.  I don't want to hurt anyone, but then again I do, it's a constant debate in my brain and the bitch in my head is always trying to convince me to do it.  But there's another who is telling me it's wrong.  They're both me, I hate it, because I'm a disgusting person who wants to hurt people, but I can't even decide on that.\n\nThere's another specific thought that I consider a sexual/romantic fantasy, no idea why.  But I've always found it so amazing that a person would be willing to kill for you and stalk you.  People get hurt from this shit, and I hate how much I want it.  I just want someone who's willing to kill with me too.  But I still don't want to hurt anyone.  Something is very much wrong with me and I want it to stop, but if I talk about what we 'want' to do, then I'll be back in the ward.  I have a specific timeline to it too, I wouldn't kill anyone alone, only with my lovers maybe.  But I still don't want to do it.  I want help but they'll put me away again.\n\nThe last thing is just my \"voices\" I guess you could say.  I would really consider them voices tho, they're all me, they're all my wants, but they fight and it's annoying.  Everyone has them, but I'm afraid he'll make me go on pills to make them go away, we're friends.  Well some of us are, which is weird because we're all me.  We all have at least one thing we agree on.  But it's mainly stuff like \"You know you want to do it, just one little stab will do.\" \"But it's wrong, you'll shouldn't.\" \"Shut up, as long as you plan you won't get caught.\". \"But knowing us we will, we're just that fucking stupid.\" Etc.\n\nWe're all the same person, but for some reason I feel offended whenever we don't use \"we\", they've never made me zone out and done stuff tho.  I know for a fact I don't have DID so don't fucking say it's DID.  We're all me, it's all of my thoughts, nobody else's, I just need to make them shut up once in awhile.  I'm only 15, what the fuck is wrong with me, I hate this.  I'm probably faking this for attention, it's probably all fake for all I know???\n\n\nAnyways, sorry if I got off topic, but those are the main things I want advice on talking about.  But I need a way to talk about these things without being put back into the ward.  It's not a bad place, and I do miss it sometimes, but it's expensive and makes me miss out on the outside world.  I hate it more than I like it.\n\nSorry if this post was jumbled, I tend to have jumbled thoughts sometimes.  Thank you for reading, and if you have advice on talking about these things please do give em.\n\nAlso how the fuck do I talk about sexual shit with my therapist?  It feels weird.\n\nAlso also, these aren't for immediate talkings, imma need time but the advice would help.  I know I'm a bad person but I'm gonna try and fix myself.  I haven't acted on any of my bad thoughts.",

I\u2019m really trying but nothing seems to work I just seem to always find myself back to this place. I\u2019m drowning and I don\u2019t wanna fight to breathe. I started feeling like this about a week ago. I started to get homeschooled after talking a month off for health reasons. I thought if I worked hard enough I\u2019ll get the credits sooner for a garenteed graduation. I started off with English and dispite me having some spelling problems I did well. Then I went off to math. I spent 12 hours in the span of 4 days just doing math but I\u2019m still failing( I\u2019m a junior in high school and currently taking algebra 1 a freshman class) I feel so stressed I worked so hard just to be failing I can\u2019t even think right everything feel like mush everything is just blending together I can\u2019t even speak without it sounding like gibberish. I feel like a failure I know I\u2019m sounds like I\u2019m being dramatic but I\u2019ve spent 3 years learning the same math and I just can\u2019t get it. It doesn\u2019t make since I\u2019m working so hard I\u2019m taring apart everything good I work for my mental health. And I can\u2019t dropout because my family will just think bad opone me and I want to go to college I already know what I want to do with my life but this constant reminder that I\u2019m failing a class kid younger then me are passing really hurts.  I used to think bad things only happened to me because god knew I should have died and he\u2019s just waiting for me to do it. It\u2019s not just the math but my physical health is going down the crap hole and I\u2019m always so tired I spend 4-6 hours a day in my room in the dark looking at a computer for what a crap handshake and a paper say I wasted time and energy for.  I\u2019m so tired of trying I\u2019m so tired of feel like I loser, feeling like I\u2019m stupid. People have asked my why I haven\u2019t passed and I just say I don\u2019t know. I just want it to get better I wish I was smarter I wish I was healthier I wish I was happy all the time. I need three years of math and I can\u2019t even get through the first. I want to graduate on time so I can leave the crap show that is public high school I don\u2019t wanna stay another year because of a class I\u2019m clearly to dumb to pass.

    "text": "I\u2019m struggling to cope with my fathers addiction, I don\u2019t know if I should cut him out of my life or not\n\nThis is going to be sorta long but if your able please read it, I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this and really want someone to respond\n\nFor background, I\u2019m 15 and throughout the entirety of my childhood my father was a bad alcoholic. It was better when I was younger, the type of alcoholism that you see a lot in middle aged dads, but as I got older he got worse, he drank more and became violent. A lot of my childhood I spent doing parental duties for me, my brother, and my dad. My mom worked nights and if I didn\u2019t take care of all of us it wasn\u2019t safe, this started probably when I was eight or nine. I was scared of him for most of my childhood, I knew it was an issue but it became apparent one Sunday when he was holding a gun to my mothers head, telling me it was my fault. I\u2019ll never be able to forget my brother fighting the gun away from him and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything. It was then that I thought to myself I hated my father for the first time. A cycle of his addiction getting worse and his (mostly emotional or just being too rough) abuse rising was getting worse as I got older, so I spent most of my life stuck in my room hiding from him, or caring for myself and him and my brother to an extent. It was a year or two before my parents divorce when I started to notice when I noticed he would go sit in his truck for long periods of time on a regular basis. Now I know he went the to use. When my mom told me she was filing for divorce I had to force myself to cry, I felt guilty about it but at that point my father no longer acted like a father. When I was in eight grade he had a reaction to alcohol and his heart meds, I\u2019m not sure if this is true or if it was an od, at the time it would have made sense. He was in and out of the hospital multiple times for 2 and a half years, being in comas and put in rehab that never stuck. He was left with memory and physical issues and a sort of inability to properly care for himself, but won\u2019t accept help. At that point I felt that he had taken my childhood from me, but was still my father.\n\nNow, I live only with my mother (he didn\u2019t show up to the custody court, he later told me he \u201cpartied through it\u201d) with no visitation to my father. I still see him some times, just stopping by his apartment maybe twice a week and breakfast dates once a month. His drug addiction has been terrible lately. A couple weeks ago I saw him while I was wearing a tank top and he was too high to recognize me as his daughter and kept staring at my chest, I was still able to view him as a father after he told me he\u2019d kill me, but this was different and I dont know how to take it, I think it was one of the last straws in me seeing him as a father. I saw him today, and when he opened the door all I saw was a junkie. I couldn\u2019t connect any of the good memories to him, only sitting on the bathroom floor while he tried to break the lock while he was high because I didn\u2019t do the dishes right, and being scared every time I got in his truck, and his dealer banging on the door when I was home alone. There wasn\u2019t any playing catch or paternal memory\u2019s to be associated with him. \n\nI hate seeing him high, but I genuinely don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be sober again. With his health problems I know it won\u2019t be long, even without his addictions. I don\u2019t know if I should cut him out to protect myself from having to see him high. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth seeing him if I don\u2019t see him as a father anymore, but maybe it\u2019ll come back. I\u2019ve been thinking about giving an ultimatum of sorts, he tries to get clean and checks into a care home after rehab (it\u2019s appropriate with his medical conditions) or I don\u2019t see him ever again, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to understand or remember it with his mental issues from, nevermind that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m strong enough to say it. I also don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll choose me over drugs, and I don\u2019t know if I can take it if he says he won\u2019t get clean for me. I don\u2019t know why I expec him to if he hasn\u2019t before.\n\nI know my mental health will improve not seeing his addiction but I don\u2019t know what to think of losing hope like that",

About two years ago I begged my mom to go to a therapist and I have but it took a long time of me begging my mom to convince her that something is wrong with me. It took about 6 months and me not going to school or getting out of bed for 2 weeks. I have also struggled with panic attacks in the past but I began having them at least twice a week. When i told my mom she didn't think it was a big deal and I don't blame her that much but when i told my therapist she basically said okay and then when i mentioned them again she told me that i was not having panic attacks? Like she told me because i get them when I am stressed about going outside or seeing a drunk man because of my trauma and not randomly when I'm happy they don't count as panic attacks? Fine if that's not the right word for it but the way she said it seemed like I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I also told her that I go to sleep every night hoping not to wake up and she didn't say anything about that too. My mom told me that she told her that i was going trough a \"momentary crisis\". I also tried going to the school counselor and she also basically told me that it was a momentary thing and that it will pass. Well guess what it has been a year and its worse than ever. When i told my therapist that i couldn't go to school or even outside without feeling so anxious that i was barely able to breathe she basically told me that i just need to go to school and get into the rhythm. I can't fucking take it when people tell me that its momentary because its not. I have been struggling for so fucking long and just because i don't show it and am still functional and going to school doesn't mean i don't want to die every day. When I try talking to friends and family they just give me simple advice like you just need to go to school but they don't understand that its not that easy for me. I don't blame them for not understanding how i feel but when i try to explain they say that they know or that they feel the same which i can guarantee that they do not because they would not tell me those things if they did. I also have so many passive suicidal thoughts and i know i won't commit suicide but its still exhausting living every day of my life wishing that a car would hit me or that i get an illness or something.\n\n I have never seriously considered my future, I think that i just always thought i would either die from not taking care of my self or that i would kill myself and I think that has been my coping mechanism. Now that i am at a point in my life where i never thought i would be I really have no fucking idea what to do. I am really just fucking exhausted and want someone to tell me that my problems are real and scary and that they won't pass on their own but that it will be okay. I'm really tired of living.\n\nI am so sorry for such a long post but i needed to say this somewhere. I have been crying for an hour and this helped me calm down.",

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, etc since middle school. I\u2019m stuck in the house all day because I don\u2019t have my own car yet and I\u2019m usually alone. I start my third job of this year next week. I used to live with my boyfriend at his moms house but that place was absolute hell. His mom wasn\u2019t mean or anything like that to me, she actually liked me, but she is a legit hoarder, the house is disgusting, and she and the rest of my boyfriend\u2019s family living there are basically inconsiderate. Long story, but my mental health deteriorates whenever I\u2019m there. Unfortunately, my boyfriend is stuck there, and my parents won\u2019t let him come in our house. I feel our relationship is dying since I refuse to come over to his moms house now. He works long hours with only one day off a week. I feel my life is slipping away, and I don\u2019t know what to do. My childhood friend left me for choosing to be with my boyfriend. She\u2019ll stop texting me after she asks if I\u2019m still with him and I say no. I personally felt like I was thrown under the bus long before I met my boyfriend, as she would always text other people whenever I wanted to hang out.",

My family doesn\u2019t believe in mental health and thinks wanting to die is for the mentally ill. I guess most of it culminates from me still being in love with my ex over 2 years after. I just want the suffering to end once and for all but don\u2019t know how to healthfully do so or find help. The internet is my first and only resort I guess.

So for example, he moved from a city where he says the people were \"so depressed\" to a city where they are \"alive and happy,\" but EVERY time someone even mentions the old city he goes on these like 10 minute \"rants\" about how depressing the people there were and how he hated their ways of life and how disgusting they are, etc etc. Like completely unprovoked lol\n\nOther things too, like he has an aversion to liars and if you even see something on a tv show that features a lie he'll go on a similar 10-15 minute rant about how he hated that. This stuff happnes at least once or twice a day, and there's like no changing the subject until he decides he's said his piece. \n\nIs there like a better term for all this?  Rumination, maybe? I want to bring it up with him because it seems to just put him in really dark moods. He doesn't have a history of mental illness and would be one of the \"I don't need therapy/help\" kind of people if you suggested it.\n\nSo I guess I just would love to know if this is commonly linked to something or if there is a nice way to bring this up to him (my anxiety kind of prevents me from just outright saying what I'm saying in this post to his face haha)",

    "text": "I\u2019m in a bout of existential depression. But it and the anxiety is getting worse. \n\nI\u2019ve convinced myself that my friends don\u2019t like me, and if they somehow did, I don\u2019t deserve it. I haven\u2019t really left the house in a while. I live on a college campus in the middle of the city so I get really self-conscious walking around if I\u2019m not looking my absolute best. I chastise myself for every social interaction I have, because even if I don\u2019t do anything weird or awkward, I still think I just am. I\u2019ve entered this spiral of self-loathing and fear of interaction. \n\nAnd the worst part is I can\u2019t justify doing anything to help myself because if we\u2019re being honest what good does any time invested in myself do? I mean, I\u2019m just a single person out of eight billion people on this planet. Statistically and socially I don\u2019t really matter. Doing things like cleaning my room when I know no one will ever come in, or making myself food when I\u2019m just going to have to do twice as much work cleaning the dishes, those things sound so meaningless and superficial in the grand scheme of things that I can\u2019t rationalize doing them. And since they only benefit me I feel like it\u2019s selfish, and I don\u2019t like being selfish. I\u2019m just paralyzed by my own mind. \n\nI wish I could go on autopilot. I\u2019ve been spacing out at random moments during the day but I mean fully. I just want to stop being conscious for a while. That sounds crazy.\n\nSkip the next paragraph if you\u2019d like but it\u2019s just an insight to how rabbit-holey my mind has become. I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m terrified of going out into the kitchen. The other occupants of the suite, who seem to always be in the kitchen, always make such elaborate food and I can barely muster macaroni and cheese, or quesadillas, or some variant of those, and they\u2019re always emphasizing eating and being healthy, so I feel like they look down on what I eat. I do have recipes for other things but there isn\u2019t enough room for me to put a cutting board on the kitchen counter. One of our suitemates is borderline hoarder, and half of us don\u2019t do their dishes for days at a time. The sink is always full of dirty dishes and the eating table is covered in various pots, pans, and tupperware. If I do cook, I wash my dishes immediately after. But I have to wedge the dishes between the accumulated dirty dishes and the sink spout to even get it wet, and I always spill on myself since the sink is only one-sided, with no garbage disposal, and full of other people\u2019s dirty dishes. The drying rack has, as long as I\u2019ve lived here, never been empty.  Someone\u2019s dishes are always in there, so when I\u2019m the last one to cook, I have to balance my pan on top of the pile of drying dishes. I don\u2019t like this. So I haven\u2019t really gone out or eaten a meal in like three days. I\u2019m pretty much living off Sweet Heat Doritos and a couple bottles of water. I want to make food, but then my mind comes up with an extensive list on Why It\u2019s Not Really Worth It. I\u2019ve had an issue with eating before but now it\u2019s intensified. I feel like sometimes I\u2019m not even worth the food in my pantry. \n\n\nBut I digress. I guess. I\u2019m so angry at the world and myself. And I\u2019m so cynical and critical. I want to better myself, because I\u2019m too much of a coward to actually end my life, and I don\u2019t really have another option. But my brain can\u2019t come up with a single reason as to why I, a single insignificant speck on this planet, deserves to do anything for themself. And it comes up with rational reasons as to how pointless it is. And then since I don\u2019t have any ammunition besides, \u201cWell, I should do it because, I don\u2019t know, I should\u201d, I just give up. And none of this short term stuff matters. None of it affects what has happened to you, who you are, or how the world will act. It feels pointless. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. Ramble over. I just feel directionless. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even post this. It\u2019s ridiculous. But I\u2019m going to. I know it\u2019s not worth it or won\u2019t do anything but I just don\u2019t know what to do. I think I\u2019m gonna rot in this room before my mind eases up on the criticism.",

My life is in ruins for quite some time and i just dont know how to fix it. When i was younger, i used to be my parents pride and joy, especially with the fact that we were really poor back then, we didnt have much at all and for that they took great pride of my achievements, they always bragged me to everyone. I was the typical smarty kid who does everything. Always joins contests, always gets the first place, and everyone was so proud of me. \n\nThat went on until I reached 4th grade. Thing is, my parents always had full attention on me and made me study so much, made me so advanced, and made sure i joined every possible contest. My father would even make me practice test papers before exams, and their expectations where so high that one time i got 3 wrongs on my exam and i hid it and lied about it, in fear that theyll beat me up badly if they found out. I always thought that maybe because of how much they made me so dependent on them, that i never learned how to be independent in the first place. \n\nWhen I reached 4th grade, My parents decided to open up a business, to help earn money. And because of this they were rarely home and came home late, i have a brother who was 5 at that time but he always came with them, so I was always alone home. I didnt know what to do and later on i just watched and didnt study. For some reason i just started to not like studying? It was suddenly harder to study. And from there, everything went downhill. My grades in 4th grade were okay, not until 6th grade, where i first didnt make it to honors. My parents were so dissapointed, my mother cried, and as for my father, he ignored me for one month. He works for the school ive been studying on as a teacher, you see. The only reason i got in a private school was because he was a teacher. The enrollment fee is GREATLY decreased. Anyways, id always wait for him in the faculty and he wouldnt talk to me, at all. Sometimes hed whisper how much dissappointment i have brought upon my family and to him as well. Then when we get to the car, he starts scolding me. I felt like shit.\n\nNow online school happened. I wouldnt say my grades went lower, id say higher. But not that high. \n\nMy mental health is getting worser, its been like this ever since i was 8. I have a lot of issues and trauma and i guess it got to me. My mental health has gotten so worse that i even tried to kill myself (which failed). \n\nI just cant do anything but i also want to do something but i dont want to at the same time. My mind is saying no and i hate it. I hate all of this. Its always been like this, i have so much missing activities and it stresses me out but i dont do anything about it at the same time.\nI feel so worthless that maybe its better if i just went poof.\n\nI tried to hint to my parents or atleast ask them what they think about mental health. They...think that people with mental issues are just dramatic and is all the Devils doing. Ever since then, i never asked.\n\nAnd im afraid im not being a good friend either, i have this one close friend and she means everything to me. We send each other voicemails, like a lot. They range from hours and so on. We listen to each other. But now I barely listen anymore. I dont know i just feel so guilty and i feel like im not doing my part and then shell leave me.\n\nIll try to continue this later, my eyes are hurting so much, i think i should sleep.",
