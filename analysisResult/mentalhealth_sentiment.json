[{"text": "Well.. recently did psyc ward the second time, but i had to leave because i would've had to go into quarantine for a week. I couldn't take it after 2 hours and went home the next day. Now, I just have to get my shit together and go to school because my parents threatened to sell my dog if i didn't. So now i just mute everything by barely sleeping or eating. Alcohol seems way easier but i really don't want to loose my dog so yeah, i just drag myself to school and back home, don't eat till afternoon and go to sleep at 3:30am. I have to get up at 6am. Everyone seems to think i'm fine since i really try to maintain that \"you guys can count on me, i've got this\"  and \" i don't get hurt unless it's broken or bleeding uncontrolably\". I kinda got rid of that till i noticed that nobody even cared how i was feeling, not even my therapist. She decided to show me pictures of past selfharm wounds ( it used to be much worse last year around this time according to everyone around me) and even after i told her i didn't want to see it since it would trigger the hell out of me she showed that to me anyways. I was a wreck for the rest of the day. A few days after that ( it could've been weeks, i just live in a constant blur) i got a diffrent therapist that is closer to where i live and all she did was listen to what my parents think i feel like and then told me \" well just go to school\". So i just decided to not give a fuck anymore and just started to bearly sleep so i couldn't think straight. At least i can go to school like this, which means i'll keep my dog. But i'm scared that she'll be gone one day and that i leaned too much on her again, just like i did with my grandmother. Everything just seems to slip away to the point that when i sleep i dream that all of what i have would just be gone and there would be no teachers that cheerfully great you every moring, no dog that wakes you up while licking through your face, and no friends that are just as chaotic as i am. I can't see these things as good, but i'd sure be a whole lot more miserable if i wouldn't have to pretend for someone. I'm starting to loose stuff already though. I can't really play guitar anymore, neither can i sing or anything like that. I can't even cry, and i tend to be really dizzy a lot of the time. I constantly look behind me in bathrooms and stuff because i'm scared of something. I can't quite realize what i'm scared of, but i'm scared of something to the degree of \"well fuck it, just get out of here\" And it's been the same for two years. From age 13 to 15. That's quite a lot to me. And it's a lot that's gone, people i lost, i took for granted, would've wanted to say goodbye to. Maybe at least cried at the funeral. Or at least coped with it. I still don't really get that i won't return to my grandma and that she won't make soup and vanilla pudding with berries. And i hate myself for it. I hate myself for not being able to remember her face, her voice, the house i had so many great moments in that i can't really recall. All i can remember is that i said that grandma could make it because it was only a bit of a cough. Her lungs collapsed. I never saw her again. I couldn't say goodbye. To one of my dearest humans i could never say that i loved her, she couldn't see me be an adult, be a teen.

No matter where I am or what I'm doing I can't help but notice how everybody else is so much better off. I'm still a minor and can't afford a therapist so the only emotional support I have is my parents. They initially tried to help me when these feelings of inadequacy first started (a few years ago), but now they've grown tired of me and just dismiss this. I honestly can't blame them. I'm a pathetic wreck of a human being, even at such an early age.\n\nEvery minute of my life is spent obsessively comparing myself to my peers in one way or another. It's a losing battle. People will always say 'you can never know what someone's going through, don't wish to be someone else' but that's bullcrap. Just by looking at my classmates I can tell nobody is nearly as screwed up in the head as me. While everyone else is vibrant and cheerful, I'm the kid who always sits alone silently obsessing over my inadequacy and myself in general. I can see the pity in their eyes when they approach me.\n\nMy mindset is that life is some sort of competition to be won. Whether it's academic performance, social status, appearance I tend to believe that determines my value. Most people who think like this only apply these standards to themselves. Not me though. I've sunken so deep into this toxic mindset that whenever I feel inadequate, I like to think about people who have it worse than me to cheer up. I have an insatiable desire to be idolized by people.\n\nI don't have any diagnosed mental disorders but I suspect Maladaptive Daydreaming. I've spent hours every day fantasizing about stuff for 10 years now. It started out as harmless fantasies via which I would escape reality, but now it's just obsessively thinking about this perfect version of myself I badly crave to be. Yet I know I never will. I fantasize about my family and friends describing how proud they are of my idealized self. Sad story, I know. Although I might have an idea of where this all started.\n\nGrowing up, I developed much faster than my peers on an intellectual level. I won't get into too much details but I was used to constant praise for everyone. My parents would even go as far as mocking other kids' perceived inadequacies as a way to compliment me. Then I grew up, got a good look at myself, realized I'm not this demigod I was made out to be and fell into a hole i never got out of. I believe this is what you call Gifted Kid Syndrome. \n\nHow do I put a stop to this obsession? Ever since I got my reality check a few years ago, I've felt miserable because my standards remain insanely high. I can't even imagine a day without comparing myself to someone, much less living like that. It's absolute torture. It's been getting way worse over the past month, so much so that I started feeling constant chest tightness and shortness of breath that gets unbearable when I'm stressed. You know it's bad when you're a teenager and your mental health is so messed up you can't breathe properly. And yes, I went to several doctors. Got all kinds of tests done and nothing seems to be wrong. All of them chalk it up to stress. If I don't get my brain to function like that of a normal human being, it might end up being the death of me.\n\nTherapy is off the table since we can't afford that kind of thing.

Continuing my latter preface; high level athlete, well above average grades and so forth. Going on 6 or so years with anxiety and depression that renders me unable to interact socially and driven to self harm and suicide. This where the high functioning part comes in. A couple of years ago a bad breakup sent me off the deep end. suicide and eating disorder bad. My response was chronic work relating to my specific sport, overall intensive exercise and overachieving in school. I had some really good older guys I met through my sport that showed me work being an outlet for whatever emotional shit you're afflicted by (I know not the healthiest but if it works it works right?) That was really the start of my obsession with self improvement. At the time I viewed self improvement as a remedy to all mental ailment. I picked up on meditation for a while and all the corresponding self care shit.  I was genuinely in a good place for a while. Following tearing a nerve in my back I was damn near bed ridden in physical condition. Determined to play through it, I fucked myself up worse. To try to keep things concise I was pretty much a physical shell of a person for 2 years. All the things that elevated my conditions, I was suddenly unable to do. All mental ailments I previously stated came flooding back fitting into my head and that empty cavity of chest like a sadistic puzzle piece.

I know I will live with everything I've been through forever. Every friend I've lost, every betrayal, every disappointment. But that's ok I guess. That shit's apart of who I am. I know for as long as I've known turmoil when I finally experience peace it will greatly be cherished.

Their friendship, their awkwardness, both of the character's good will. I started feeling heartbroken over it, since it was so good, I start feeling like I won't ever feel that way in life, therefore I want to stay in it for a long time. It's so sweet and beautiful and it always breaks my heart thinking about such perfection for some reason.\n\nA similar thing happened to me with One Piece. The emotions that I felt watching the perfect life, full of travel, fun, friends, but also sacrifice, struggle and grief, just made it so real for me. And My Dress Up Darling has that realness aspect too. That's why it's so hard to get over, since everything seems plausible. One Piece now doesn't after thinking a bit. You have to work and there is beauty in work, you can't always travel. But Dress Up Darling is different, it's two high-school students who slowly fall in love with each other, everything through being kind to one another and sharing their passions. It's realistic. Of course the author created it to be perfect, but it still doesn't take away the fact that it can happen in real life.\n\nSo the problem is, I can't focus on work because of this. While I'm writing this, distracting myself on reddit, instagram, twitter (also, I can't watch videos and I find it hard to watch other anime for some reason, because I want to just indulge in that perfect one and watching others just feels wrong, but some give me comfort), out running errands or spending time outside, communicating and talking to other people, I'm feeling great actually, but when I return to my room and I have to work again, it's like the standards of a fictional reality hit me and I cannot focus.

However, I very much do have episodes of feeling 'high' which can either be extremely productive (which doesn't happen often and the most it's lasted is 4 days) and self-destructive ones where I basically feel like I'm powerful I guess so I can do risky things like wanting to jump off roofs, stabbing myself, taking a lot of pills etc because for some reason ever though in the back of my mind I know there's low chance with survival in all of that, in the moment I do it for the thrill.\n\nBut on the other side I have a self destructive side that's coming from a low perspective too.

I remember getting on the bus and starting to feel 'off' but couldn't place why. I then started to feel numb and I couldn't focus on the world around me. I distinctively also remember when looking out the window, things were going too quick for me and even though I was on a bus going at a stable speed, It felt like it was all speeding up and I was far behind. I could see the signs outside but when trying to read them I had to really focus because it was blurry in my head. Not blurry vision, but blurry in my head. Then I remember starting to feel low and losing energy and motivation to keep my head up. Its the kinda tired of the world I feel when I'm depressed. No want to be there, no energy mentally to hold my head up or even present to be okay anymore. I just leaned against the bus window whilst the world outside was just quiet around me. I mean walking through the bus bus station was weird because I didn't even make note of the people. I just dodged and walked past them all in a daze seeing them there to avoid, but not registering them there if that makes sense.\n\nAnyways, This continued until I got home. Then when I got home I got extremely self destructive and was romantising cutting and graphically describing how I wanted to cut (TW) all down my legs so when I bent my knees the cuts would gape, vertically down my arms, up and round the face (but I for some reason wanted to avoid the eyes), extending my smile (think its called the joker or something in the sh community) and I said something along the lines of 'a thin line down my stomach and then force down and out' with more graphic description I'm going to leave out talking about my parts. How I wanted to remove them and 'hack' them off with a knife. This then morphed into me saying how men just want me alive to use me for s\u00a3\u00a3x and that my existence only amounted to being 'their little traumatised s\u00a3\u00a3x doll'. This then continued where I started talking about allowing myself to be used so much to where its triggering to the point of where 'have no reason not to'... Commit s. You all know what I'm talking about. Saying how that way I'd push people away enough and that they'll never want me anymore so then I wouldn't have to feel bad or allow others to suffer. Because they wouldn't care and I'd be even more of a low life to them than I already am.\n\n\nThen depression hits. Don't need to describe that too much other than I don't feel real and have the usual low self worth, esteem, view on the world etc. Can get extremely suicidal too. Losing motivation, not able to pay attention in sixth form because of it etc.\n\nThen where I hypersexualise myself with men. Feeling like I deserve to be used as a vessel for their pleasure. But I don't want to be and I use it as a way to self destruct. Normally Afterwards I get extremely triggered at what I've done and have a breakdown because I'm actually gay. I'm lesbian. I have a fear of men and sexual things to the point of panic attacks. Especially with men. So.\n\n\nI'm scared of mentioning all this in the detail that it is because of being sectioned or something. I didn't even sh yesterday, despite having the worst ideation about it I've ever had. I was imaging it as I was typing and in a sense it felt real. I couldn't feel it type real but I could see it.

Tone policing. Tone policing is a tactic in arguments that abusers use to shift the conversation away from what the abused person is putting forth and onto how they put it.\n\nA common one that happens not only in this sub but all over the internet is, just for example, \"being mentally ill does not give you the right to be rude\".\n\nA good response to this is, fukk you, I will tell you what I need to tell you the way I need to tell you it. One person in a position of say once in my life tried to correct me on how I was referring to my own genitals when I was complaining about how another member of the household was grabbing them and twisting just for giggles (aka sexual assault) before I punched her in the head hard enough to put her on the ground. She did learn a valuable lesson that day, however. If you keep grabbing your twelve year old brother by his hairy cock and hurting him that way enough times, he will hit you like you have never been hit before.\n\nBut no, the shitbreath of the house never learned. Told me to use the right term. Would not even respond when I angrily tried to bring it to his attention that my punch was for the sole purpose of making repeated assaults stop. But then again, with the way shitbreath and compliance were assaulting me on a regular basis, maybe they just did not want to address that subject.\n\nThis is what I am talking about when I say that I want to kill the bullies that I used to share a house with, and that tone policing is wrong. Oh no, Baphomet In Steel, you are not validly complaining that your little sister is assaulting you in a way that should get an adult thrown in prison. You are using the wrong word.\n\nSo if you find yourself wanting to type \"being mentally ill does not give you the right to be rude\" when someone is writing angrily about being treated in a manner that they feel is wrong, even if they are incorrect, do not do it. It does not make you look like an authority. It makes you look like an absolute piece of shit that I would rattle off the sins of as a eulogy.\n\nI once lived with two people I would do that to.\n\n[This is a good place to learn the more generalised definition of tone policing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing) This IS what happened, maayte, so get over yourself and eat shit before licking your shoes clean.\n\n[This is also a brilliant article that explains what tone policing is](https://shesaid.com/tone-policing/), as well as illustrating the difference between it and setting boundaries, and when tone policing **becomes toxic**. I emphasised that one in particular because \"being X does not give you the right to be rude\" is one of the most highly toxic forms of tone policing.\n\nSo on the behalf of all the people in this sub who struggle daily with the effects of abuse, such as the massive problems with anxiety or the seeing of your abusers' faces on every person who passes you, and wanting to punch them in my particular case, do not tell people that what they struggle with does not give them the right to be rude. I have never been told that what I live with every day does not give me a right to be rude face to face. Because people only need to look at me and listen to me speak for a little while to know how bad an idea it is. The alternative to me being rude is not one people generally like.\n\nSometimes, when I am watching the Black Mirror episode Hated In The Nation, I know that a Game Of Consequences that exclusively targets people who tone police would be a great thing for Humanity.", "neg": 0.176, "neu": 0.761, "pos": 0.062, "compound": -0.9985}, {"text": "MindDoc- A Mental Health Application is getting popular among its users.

Because human beings have great minds that work much better, the less human beings use their minds, the more they would become like animals, I don't mean it in a bad way, maybe it's fun for some people to live a life where you ignore your mind and follow your body (desires) just like animals, but it just makes us miserable in my opinion, the mind is what needs to be focused on and the rest of the body will follow, a healthy mind will bring a healthy body. \n\nSo if we use our minds we can become better, I think it's all indications that our minds are great and we need to give them lots of attention with training. So the rest of our bodies can follow up our minds, because minds know better than anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been thinking of how can we really \"train our minds\"? \n\nIn my opinion there's 2 major areas that we need to focus on in our minds:\n\n1) Getting rid of unneccessary information and thoughts. (Deleting)\n\nThis would be helpful in reducing our stress, imagine you could delete that memory of when you peed yourself and embarrassed yourself in class, imagine you could delete your memory of having the worst work day you had in your life once you get home and enjoy your time, imagine you could delete all of the thoughts you have before going into an important job interview and just live the moment.\n\nI like to think of it as closing those background applications on your cellphone.\n\nI think this skill could be trained the moment you realize that these thoughts don't improve your life, I could cry in my room because I embarrassed myself in class today, but I could use those two hours to chill around and have fun..\n\nI think it's about learning to shut down these unimportant thoughts everytime they come to you, and learning to have fun despite them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Training the rest of your body to follow your mind orders. (Controlling)\n\nWhy do I sometimes eat that chocolate bar even though I knew that I need to lose 10 kgs to be healthy? What's so hard about controlling myself? \n\nWhat's so hard in being very disciplined about anything? whether it's studying, working out, eating clean...\n\nIn my opinion, it comes down to that little split second of thought you do in your mind without feeling about it and taking decisions, you take that chocolate bar and eat it because your mind lost the battle to your body desires, your body wants that yummy bar, even though it's bad for you and your mind knows it, your mind didn't stand a chance, that's because your mind isn't trained enough for these battles.\n\nI think that starting slowly is key, mind training is harder than working out your body, mind training is super tiring, you can't rush it or your mind will lose the battles. The most important thing is focusing on the \"bad days\", those days that you feel you don't want to do that homework, you don't want to go to the gym, you don't want to diet, you don't want to clean your room, you don't want to brush your teeth ...... IN those days, it's exactly when you train your mind, whenever you win a battle against your body desires/laziness, your mind will get stronger, and will start winning bigger and bigger battles the stronger it gets.\n\nThe key in my opinion is starting with something small that you think you can force yourself (aka your mind can win your body desires) in your bad days to do them, like reading for 15 mins, it's not alot, but can you do it for a whole year consistently without missing ONE day? that's where the real challenge is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.", "neg": 0.108, "neu": 0.759, "pos": 0.133, "compound": 0.9803}, {"text": "I know this is not the place for that, and ik you guys are gonna tell me to go see a real professional but that is just out of the question, I can't, I would get locked up, and so for now I'll just look here for people that might be able to help me a bit", "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.94, "pos": 0.06, "compound": 0.5499}, {"text": "I'm a 33 yr old male and I've recently been struggling with what (I think) is my partner finally leaving me.

I'm honestly at a loss for what to do in this situation. \n\nMy (26f) younger sister (17f) has been struggling with depersonalization for a while now. It's been getting really bad recently. The last few weeks she hasn't been going to school because she says being in crowds makes her depersonalization worse. Instead, she stays home and games all day. We let it slide at first, because classes had an online option due to covid, and because my sister isn't the type to cry wolf or bring attention to herself. She has always been a super sweet and quiet kid. But now that online classes aren't an option anymore, we have been pushing her to attend her classes even though she says its bad for her mental health. We do this because the alternative would be her essentially temporarily dropping out of school. Or I guess we could go through the process of getting her diagnosed and get special treatment from the school where she can do school from home, but who knows how long that process would take and if her staying home would make her feel better or worse in the long run. We booked an in-person appointment with a psychotherapist (in the past we tried using the free online counsellors for youth, but she didn't like the online option and there was no in-person option, so she stopped after 1 session). She went for the first time last week, which she said was nice because she opened up.\n\nHowever, my younger sister just told my other sister that she tried killing herself using pills yesterday. At this point, I don't know what to do. I've always been an ear to listen to my sisters problems, I've offered whatever support I can. I found a counselling and am committed to taking her and paying for her sessions on a regular basis (my parents are lower-income so it would be hard on them). \n\nWhat should I do? Should I continue making her go to school and restricting her computer time (I said that she can only go on the computer in the late afternoon/evening until 11 p.m. if she goes to school that day, otherwise no computer)? Should I find a psychologist instead of psychiatrist? What should I say to her? She isn't her usual sweet self, I can see she is hurting so much each day. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!", "neg": 0.111, "neu": 0.819, "pos": 0.07, "compound": -0.9556}, {"text": "Or any other kind of media like apps or videos, anything that would help.

So I\u2019m a 19-year-old guy from Southern California, I dated my ex for about 8 months and it was a relationship plagued with many issues. She cheated on me at the beginning of the relationship and I later found out stayed with her and then cheated on her. It was this weird situation because we both wronged each other so we saw it as we\u2019re equal let\u2019s try to make this work. Though our relationship could be considered rocky at best I still loved her very much and I had never felt such strong emotions for someone like that before. She was my first real girlfriend, she introduced me to her family and vice versa, we went on vacations with each other, we went to punk shows and enjoyed music because we had a similar taste in music. Around December she caught me flirting with girls on my phone and I guess you can say she \u201cended the relationship\u201d but everything was still the same, we would see each other regularly, have sex pretty regularly, go out and do things with one other, and talk all the time like we did. It was almost as like we never even broke but she said the relationship was over but if I prove to her that I would make a change that we would get back together. At first, I was super apologetic and begged her for forgiveness but I soon realized that everything was still the same minus the fact that we technically aren\u2019t in a relationship anymore. I did a lot of souls searching and talking to those around me who told me it was for the best that we didn\u2019t date anymore so I started talking to other girls. Around this time I meet my guitar teacher and started playing the guitar(I\u2019ve been playing for about 3 months now) it\u2019s something that makes me very happy and I enjoy doing it. Like I mentioned earlier with my ex everything felt the same except we technically weren\u2019t in a relationship but she would still say she loves and cares about me. In December I was still trying to get her forgiveness, she bought me these sick computer speakers. I bought her this ring with our names engraved on it but she didn\u2019t really seem to like it and even left it at my house and never took it. Even though that\u2019s what she was begging me to buy for her. At one point I told her that it bothered me that she completely just tossed away the ring and her response is why would I wear a promise ring when I\u2019ve broken the promise I didn\u2019t have a rebuttal to it so I dropped the subject. January rolled around and the idea of trying to gain her favor back and \u201cearning\u201d our relationship back grew to disdain. We both were on bumble/tinder, talking to other people flirting, but we still would be in this weird situation where we were in this \u201crelationship\u201d saying I love you to each other. So like I mentioned earlier I had downloaded dating apps and met/flirted with some girls. And she was doing the same thing but I told her that I\u2019m growing tired of this weird thing and that I want to be back with her and try to make things work and she was kinda blowing it off. I deleted all the dating apps I wasn\u2019t meeting flirting with any girls and I didn\u2019t do anything with anyone besides her this whole time. So fast forward to my birthday on February 1st and she bought tickets for us to go to knots berry farm(amusement park here in SoCal) we had a good time and we ended up having sex later that night. During this whole weird period, we were having sex pretty consistently. My birthday ended up being the last time we saw each for a while because. My best friends said that they saw her on bumble/tinder. I made new accounts and I saw her. She swiped right on me both times. And it set me off because I kept telling her I wanted to be with her and wanted to start over and she said wanted to as well but wanted to make sure but wanted wait and that she loved me and only wanted to be with me would always say she can\u2019t imagine being with anyone but me. So seeing her on these apps, even though we told each other we weren\u2019t going to be on them anymore. So I sent her this long message telling her how I felt about her, our relationship, and the whole tinder/bumble situation and that I was through with her. Then it was almost as she flipped the script and that she was the one begging me to get back with each other and she pulled her whole I love you I can\u2019t imagine being with one else but you blah blah. But I was done and was ready to emotionally move which I feel like for the most part I have. So I completely stopped talking to her, many of my close friends helped me out a lot, especially my best friend. I felt sorta free in a way and I was trying my best to move on. I met other girls and had hookups with a lot of them. I mean last week I had sex with two different girls in one night on Friday. But every time I feel like happy at first after but then shortly after I go back to this feeling of emptiness that I have been feeling. I and my family had a trip planned out to give a visit to our family in El Salvador and we went it was only for a week but it was the happiest I had been in so long as soon as I came back that feeling of emptiness came back full force. a couple of weeks after I came back me and my friends decided we wanted to try shrooms, it was a whole ordeal to get them but we somehow got them. We had it all planned out but it kinda fell through me and my best friend ended up taking the. I, unfortunately, had a bad trip at first the trip went super well but I took about 7 grams and it was my first time and I started telling my friend I was depressed, then it turned into I'm planning on committing suicide when I'm older. But something came upon me and I was telling him I wanted to kill myself right then and there, and I tried to kill myself but my friend stopped me. I have been pretty traumatized since that night and I have been thinking about it so much. During the time I was in El Salvador, my ex made a tik tok about me saying I was a terrible person and that I treated her horrible and that she was the victim of the relationship and it got like 12,000 views. She also posted a video on her Instagram story of some random licking her face and her kissing him after. So I wanted nothing to do with her anymore but after my bad trip, I felt emotionally vulnerable. And I texted her back and I told her what I went through and we started texting again. She told me that she wanted to see me again and I wasn't there emotionally, she came over and we ended up having sex and we've done this twice now. I just feel like I have gone through so much these last 3 months and it has been so much to handle. After I took the shrooms I felt like I needed to better my actions and I planning on going back to school I have stopped smoking weed and drinking(I never did it often but I want to completely stop). I'm growing tired of this constant feeling of emptiness I feel every day of my life, and I feel like I haven't been trying to move my life forward and I keep going back to the same place I keep telling myself I want to move from. I don't know if it's depression or what but I'm tired of the way I feel. Sometimes when I think about my bad trip I just chalk it up to me being high but other times I feel like that deep down I actually want to and that the shrooms just made me realize. I love and appreciate my best friend, my other friends, and my family because they provide me with amazing support but these feelings still linger and I'm growing tired of it. The thing that has been providing me with happiness is playing guitar and it's been my escape.

(I've been living with my mother for the past 4 years because my grandfather told me that I had to take care of her financially for the remainder of her life. That was the worst decision of my life.  During this time, my credit took a huge hit while hers stayed flawless. My relationship with my entire family is now over and I could not be happier).

I've been taken into police custody at least twice and transferred to many different hospitals for \"Marijuana psychosis\" which is Texas doctor talk for \"we can't regulate CBD products.\" I'm getting ready to file for bankruptcy and take what money I have left to start my next adventure and get a place outside of my mother's house. I have this feeling in the back of my head that I am making a wrong move. Due to my current circumstance, I have no one.

I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. It seems as if every romantic relationship I'm in leads to nothing but heartache, feelings of helplessness, and generally that I'm the bad guy in every situation. I try my best to be self aware of my own issues, so I don't show anything with any partner I've been with. Recently, I just got broken up with because quote \"You need a therapist, not a girlfriend\" and it kind of shattered me in more ways than one. It makes me feel as if I'm not allowed to have these problems. That because I'm a man, my issues are a burden to whomever I'm dating. \n\nMy entire life, I've struggled with mental health. I started showing signs of depression when I was around 11, around the same time my dad started to go to the VA for his own problems. After being physically abused from the ages of 3-12, it leaves a lasting impact on you, more than just your relationship with the abuser. It creates this thought of \"If my own dad beats on me, how is anyone supposed to love me if he doesn't even want me?\"\n\nAfter getting diagnosed at age 17 after a failed suicide attempt on March 14, 2018, I knew I needed help. I got diagnosed and I got put on medication, and it started working and helping. But then mom quit her job and I stopped getting health insurance, which means no more therapy and psychologist, which means no more medication. So for 3 years, I've been raw dogging life. No medication, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. I rarely ever drink, if I do its a glass of wine. I've started to realize my mental health problems affect more than just myself, but the people around me. I've been told in every relationship I've been in since I was 19 that my mental health issues are a burden and that I shouldn't be allowed to show these problems, that I'm expected to be of clear and sound mind 100% of the time. \n\nAt this point, I'm beyond broken mentally and completely exhausted. I feel like I'm never going to get better and that relationships are going to be a lost cause every time. I've lost countless friends because of my problems. I don't feel comfortable telling anyone except a female therapist and psychologist about my problems because I don't feel comfortable with men at all when it comes to mental health. \n\nA part of me doesn't even feel human. The only part of me that reminds me I'm remotely human is my arms being covered in tattoos and being reminded of the negative emotions I feel.

Accepting it would be step one right? Ive never told anyone. Id have a list of family members and friends of the family I could expose. What hurts me the most\u2026 is I dont remember my childhood. The first memory I have is of me getting abused. (Recently found out I was 3 years old at the time.) But like I said it was already normal to me and thinking of baby me being molested tears me up! I have children. I do not trust no one. I could never! Why didn\u2019t anyone protect me? Ive recently gotten on meds which are helping thank god cause I would be a train wreck.

Eventually a really bad video game addiction and porn entered the mix. I felt emptiness pretty much all the time throughout middle and high school. Towards the end of high school I started sneaking alcohol out of the cabinet in my house just because I wanted something, anything different to do and always felt bored. When Covid came around, I started vaping nicotine and never looked back until a few weeks ago when I finally quit. Around the same time, I bought my first THC vape because I was bored and sad and after that first night, there wasn\u2019t one day when I didn\u2019t get high for 7 months straight. I also decided to do shrooms and DMT on a whim a few months after starting smoking weed because that also got boring and I again felt an itch to do something different.

This is my alt account and I recently turned 16 years old. I've been going in therapy for about a year now and since then I've made remarkable progress according to my therapist. When I started doing sessions with her (my therapist) I was a shut in person that didn't talk to anyone. At school I didn't have any friends I didn't have any fun and life had no meaning for me. My constant thoughts were that if something would have happened to me and I died I wouldn't mind so much. Of course my parents would morn me but that's the extent of the people who would miss me. I never had suicidal tendencies or thoughts but I decided to start doing bungy jumping in order to feel the rush of death or at least come close to it but that didn't happen because I didn't die but I felt the rush. Back to my tharpist. As I said earlier I have made remarkable progress. Nowadays I value my life very handsomely and I wouldn't want to leave this world just yet. I even started making friends. For all of primary/high school years I've been alone with zero to none social skills but that changed. I made friends that I treasure dearly and I even met the love of my life. We started a relationship and we started dating and we've been together for about three and a half months, months that I will hold close to my heart forever and ever and I want to make them a life time and they want the same thing as well. We want to be together forever and ever. But things became difficult. I really don't want to discuss the bad stuff but life has thrown me some pretty awful things that have to do with the person that I love. We love each other but she is in a very difficult mental state and suffers from a mental disorder but that doesn't have to do with the bad things that have been going on in my life. Because of my partners fragile mental state I've been starting to revert to my old self and that has put made me realize that I have started to become mentally unstable as well. I try to bury my feelings because I feel that my feelings won't fit with the over filling bad emotions that my partner feels that have to do with hurting themselves in various ways or even suicide. I chose to bury my feelings so I can focus on my partner and make them feel better but that's not healthy. I've been going to therapy because I was unable to express emotion. I never cried I was never actually happy but now after all of the progress I made and all of the emotions I freed from my subconscious I force myself to devolve in to the lesser person I was so I can make my partner happy because I value them even above myself. Why would a teenager like me be exposed and worry about things like how much my alcohol my partner would drink, if they'll do drugs, if they'll take their medication, or if they'll hurt themselves again or even if they actually killed themselves. These things can make me not sleep at nights and even if I do I'll either have sleep paralysis demons or basic nightmares and thus not sleep and lower my school performance. Things have gotten so hard nowadays that my subconscious has started to make me forget basic emotions again and render me unable to feel or act again just like I was before. I over clock my brain so it can remember and so I can only focus it on them which I know it's again not healthy but it's what I do and that results in severe memory loss and depression. I sometimes wake up feeling so disoriented that I don't know who I am where I am and feeling that I want to die. My mental health is no where to be found that's why I'm here. To vent and to ask for advice because I'm supposed to say all those things to my parents before my therapists does as she suggested and then she will calm them down but I don't know if I have the courage or will to talk to them.

There are centers for it.\n\nHer best friend (Lanya) has been dealing with depression for the past couple years, as well as anorexia, self harm, and more. Now for one thing, I'm not completely against friends helping friends cope with depression, I had depression and a history of self harm myself, so I know what it's like to be dealing with that and feel like your friend are the only ones able to help. \n\nHowever, since they were young, Lanya and her mother (Katrina) have always depended on my sister to calm down her tantrums, to be there as the \"counsellor\" \n\nI can remember at least 4 incidents off the top of my head, there are more but I wasn't there for them so I don't remember as clearly.\n\n1: We had Lanya over for a playdate, and the girls wanted to go upstairs to talk.\nThe thing is, when she told them they were going to stay downstairs and try out a fun recipe, I believe it was making chocolate balloons (it's a really fun thing, you should try doing it sometime)\nLanya started throwing a big \"panic attack,\" hyperventilating, etc. And when my mom still told her no, they were not going upstairs to be alone, she stopped her \"attack\" and was staring at my mother with a hell of a stink-eye \nWhat I got from it was \"Oh no, an adult told me no, I'm going to throw a fit unless she lets us go upstairs\" then when that didn't work, she sat there and sulked. \n\n2: Lanya and her mother had texted my mom about wanting to take the girls on a playdate, but my mom was out of the house at the moment, and she didn't have her phone with her so she couldn't reply. I believe around 10-20 minutes passed, and then Lanya and Katrina showed up at our front door, *while my mother was out of the house* because they wanted to know the reply to their question. They didn't call, or text a second time, they literally showed up at our house to ask if my sister could come with them. And the fact that they live on the OTHER side of town, which is about a 20-30 minute drive, something just felt wrong. \n\n3: This incident was just a couple days ago. Katrina and Lanya showed up at our door once again, with no calls, no texts to let us know beforehand, and once again while my mother was out of the house. I let my sister answer the door, and I could hear her and Lanya talking, as soon as I stepped outside beside them to get our cat inside, they stopped talking, and were completely silent. Then my mother came back, and she and Katrina talked for a bit, she went upstairs, during the time she was upstairs I heard Katrina whisper to the girls \"I'll leave you two alone when we go out so you can talk\" \nI immediately found my mother and asked her to not give permission for my sister to go out that day. This behaviour has been a repeating pattern for a very long time.\n\nMy mother came back down the stairs and told Katrina that my sister would not be going with them, as she didn't want her to have to always be the counsellor for Lanya. Katrina then got angry at my mother, saying \"that's what friends are for\" and they left in a huff. \n\nNow I agree, friends are good to be there for you when you need help, but when things get as serious as self harm, a suicide attempt, and more, you need to find some therapy, or talk to an adult, someone who is more qualified to deal with these types of things. And most of all you don't need to come to your \"best friend\" every single time something happens that causes you to harm or panic attack again. \n\nNow the 4th event is when Lanya was in the hospital after a suicide attempt. The first person she called was my sister, to talk about her mental health and other things. I feel she should've talked to someone else, even her mother. \n\nI fear that my sister is also being influenced by Lanya, since the entire thing started, she has lost an extreme amount of weight and she wasn't a big person to start with, I believe she was around 150 and 5'6 when it started, now she is down to around 115-120, and the other day she was talking about losing more weight. I'm scared for her. \n\nI also feel distrustful of their family because every time my sister goes out with them, they will buy her something, sometimes it's quite an expensive thing, sometimes less expensive. I feel that those gifts aren't just gifts, but also something to thank/make my sister feel like she owes them.\n\nPlease everyone, I need to figure what to do with this. My mother told my sister that she would have to cut off contact with her friend Lanya, and instead that is making my sister rebel against her and throw small fits, much like the ones Lanya does. \n\nI know from experience that blatantly telling her she can't have contact with Lanya, and saying she can't be her friend, will only make her want to do that more. Please Reddit, give me any advice you can.\n\nTL:DR\nYounger sister's best friend is dealing with a ton of mental health, suicide and anorexia. She is depending on my sister for nearly everything, especially counselling. Their behaviour is strange, including coming to the house when they didn't get a response within 15-20 minutes  after texting to ask about a playdate, while my mother was not home.\nI am worried for my sister as she has lost a lot of weight since this started with her friend. \nNeed to know what to do, how to approach this with sister.", "neg": 0.114, "neu": 0.798, "pos": 0.088, "compound": -0.9871}, {"text": "I\u2019ve been making a notes list because I just found a psychiatrist who will accept my insurance.

I really really don\u2019t know what is going on and I am very confused and afraid. For the last year and some change I have not been able to avoid the constant intense desire to violently commit suicide. I fight it by trying to think hard about my family and friends and dog and all the good things in life I have to life for, but I am tired of fighting my own brain this hard every single moment of the day. There are many many days where it feels like I reach my absolute breaking point and I think I\u2019m going to do it. BUT THEN!!!!!! If I let a couple of hours go by or smoke some weed, I feel fine? Great even! But thats the thing, I never really know when that\u2019s going to end. I don\u2019t know the next time I\u2019ll feel better, or the next time I\u2019ll feel this low. It just kind of hits me and catches me off guard every single time. I have always had intense emotional problems even since early childhood, and I recall having suicidal ideations at even like 5 or 6 years old. I have been diagnosed as bipolar 2 a year ago, but I absolutely believe I have a wild case of BPD. I have thought that since high school, but only in these recent sophomore and junior years of college have the suicidal ideations have become intense urges.\n\nIt feels like I have tried every other option to try to feel \u201chappy\u201d/\u201cbetter\u201d but they all either don\u2019t work to work for a short time and eventually fail. I\u2019ve tried therapy last year for the first time thru my school, it was okay. They put me on 5mg Abilify, and that helped a bit seemed. When I was on the meds I would often joke to myself \u201cI\u2019m glad im on these meds because if I wasn\u2019t I was definitely going to kill myself\u201d, but I dont take them anymore, my mother was very concerned about all the side effects I was having (random spells of fainting or vomiting) and heavily encouraged me to get off it, and she also mentioned that maybe my emotional problems were intensified by the sudden conditions from covid on a teenager (well, I was back then) and that \u201ceveryone was going through a hard time\u201d and that made sense to me so I decided to get off it. I dont think I\u2019ll be able to afford it anyway after college. But thats just some side background info. \n\nThere are times I have blanked and scared myself and that\u2019s what makes me feel like my life is in danger sometimes. There was a time last year during an episode I just started stabbing my arm repeatedly with my cuticle nipper manicure tool thing. It broke the skin but they were all obviously very tiny. It always scared me looking back because I think if it was a razor blade or a knife or something it would have killed me. I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing. My emotions were so strong and I just started doing it. There was another time this year where during another episode I mindlessly drove to target early in the morning to get a fresh pack of razor blades to cut myself with. I did not realize what I was doing until I got all the way back home and was trying to figure out how to work the razor blade dispenser. It just hit me, \u201cwow did I really just get in my car drive 10 mins to target and buy nothing but razor blades,, to cut myself and maybe kill myself with????\u201d. This is where I worried I was getting out of control and might actually do it one day, I am scared it is soon. I don\u2019t want it to be but I am scared it might be. The urge is so strong there are times I feel no longer in complete control of my actions. \n\nI am scared I am checking the boxes for someone who is experiencing a mental health emergency. But I don\u2019t know if I really am, or if im just someone who is overdramatic, sensitive, life-inexperienced, privileged, and attention-seeking. There are times I fear that I am being attention-seeking and being manipulative with my emotions, even when I am alone and express them and don\u2019t talk to anyone irl about it. That confuses me the most. But I can never really be sure, which leads me to reddit. \n\nSometimes I think back on my thoughts (if that makes sense) and look back at previous questions I\u2019ve asked and don\u2019t know if they are normal or not. To a degree I know they aren\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really that bad. I am afraid sometimes that if I do kill myself, all these things, along with my search history, music taste, social behavior, substance abuse problem (shit I\u2019ll admit it), etc etc are all indicative of someone who is going to kill themselves. I look in the mirror and see someone who is going to kill themselves soon. I dont want to do it. I dont want to do it. I always think to myself \u201cam I going to be a suicide statistic? Are these all the inevitable signs and symptoms? Am I about to be one of the 1.1% of college students to kill themselves?\u201d This thought distresses me very much. I have never attempted suicide before. I personally know people and read about people online who have, but when they describe their emotions I do not really relate to them. It seems as though my condition is never really as serious as theirs. Like I said, I\u2019ve never officially tried before, these people have, so it makes me think that whatever crazy shit is going on in my head I just need to get over. I wish so desperately that I could do that. I think I am just emotionally weak. \n\nYou can go back in my post history and see me weird posts. Some I have hidden to avoid ridicule, but I don\u2019t know how to get them back. I notice people around me always ask if I\u2019m okay if I ever accidentally share the slightest tip of the iceberg of my feelings with them, and the comments I get on reddit posts telling me that I should seek professional help immediately. I was looking on my school\u2019s counseling website and they have a whole special section for resources for people who might need \u201cImmediate\u201d help. Am I really one of those people? Am I experiencing a mental health emergency? Do I need to be monitored in a hospital? There are times I do feel like I am a potential danger to myself, but unlike depressed people, I at least am able to feel great sometimes. When I hear about people who come back from \u201cgrippy sock vacation\u201d (I really cringe at that term but thats what everyone around me seems to use), they mention their traumas and abuses and I didn\u2019t really have it as bad as them. I am just sensitive. \n\nI come to reddit in desperation. I have never known how to express my feelings on this without accidentally guilt tripping or manipulating people, so I avoid talking about my feelings with people I know irl, outside of therapists. Do I really need help? Like hospital help? Is this an emergency? It feels like one but is it really?

During late December and January, he distanced himself from me because he didn\u2019t believe he was ready for a relationship and because he was scared he\u2019d hurt me.

I wish i was more responsible and maybe I'd be a little less stressed. With so much work and so little time in my head everything I do is last minute, don\u2019t ask me why don\u2019t ask me why, but it is. I would of killed myself so much sooner from the sheer stress of work i had to do and the assignments i had to finish. Too many things to count and i can never miss an assignment or i would be in trouble. Homework is a trap and i can\u2019t leave it and i believe i wouldn\u2019t be roaming this earth today if it wasn\u2019t for my love. Life isn\u2019t bad, but currently isn\u2019t too good for me.

I can\u2019t get my mind off things and it\u2019s hard for me to express emotions without driving away the people I like. My parents don\u2019t seem to get that i'm trying to do my work, I really am, but every punishment, every time i\u2019ve been told or hit, i get less enthusiastic about it. They don\u2019t see their wrongs even if i point it out to them im the crazy one. Why won\u2019t my parents just fight more, talk things out, why can\u2019t we be normal.

I would be better off not alive then anything. I still have my suicidal tendency\u2019s just suppressed because i know someone now that would be truly hurt if i took my own life. Fuck relgion and everything that comes with it. There\u2019s no heaven or hell and there\u2019s no book to tell you how to live your life. Just live being who you are and lie every now and then to get what you need. Kill yourself if there isn\u2019t an escape, because life is a bitch and only so many people can be stuck in an endless loop of nothingness. These are the thought in my head everyday written out for i can read, may the grammatical errors show that this is just spontaneous writings, because this is truly how i feel, how i may be, who I am.

Im out of therapy, therapist suggested that i should find somebody else which im trying, but its quite long run so i have now time to think about if is therapy right for me. And i dont know for sure.\n\nMy goal is to be well. Issues stucked up to the point that i felt i have no longer power to be solve them on my own. So i reached for help.\n\nAs child i was diagnosed or my mum was told that i have ADD, that was the reason i went a year late to school. It was told to her that i will grow up from it. I think that i have never grew up from it. I always thought that im dumb or something for not keeping up with long explanations. High school was hard for me (still not finished). So one day i just remembered about this ADD thingy. I read about how people were diagnosed with ADD/ADHD then they hopped on medication and the combination of therapy and drugs made them happy. That was exciting to me to heard that kind of stuff, that the solution si that easy.\n\nMy other issue was anger. It never ocured to me that i have anger issues, well i dont know if that is competely true, i just never knew that my anger issues would be so great that i could be mean to my dog... The dog that i was supposed to protect. I wanted to change, so i will not hurt him anymore.\n\nThese were the key motivations to search for help. I thought that therapy would be the place to get help.\n\nI had expetations that werent met in therapy. I thought that the diagnosis is important part of therapy, but i was proven wrong. My psychologist said that some diagnosis can be made during our time together, but is not the main thing in therapy. She said that therapy is enviroment where is looked on patient as an individual with individual needs, and there is no much need to name every individual need that the patient have. And even if that sound nice, i wan not satisfied with the answer.\n\nI mean there is also diagnosis and diagnosis... I thought that diagnosis is the first step to get help. Lets talk about ADHD. I though that soon as i get diagnosed we would try to focus on things that may improve my symptoms, which could be talking schedules, systems and stuff like that or eventualy medication.\n\nI dont know if im wrong from wanting to get better fast. And i dont know my requirements are that high. I mean i would though that if someone think that they may have ADHD, it would be best to diagnosed them and then try to help them if they have ADHD. I dont know, i just dont wanted to get help after multiple years of talking in therapy about how im struggling, if you know what i mean. Because of my english i cant realy describe well what im trying to say...\n\nSo now im thinking that i should rather get diagnosed and then hop on therapy. I dont know. Its wo weird... I would just thoguht that i would find help in one person...\n\nMy other issues are: emptiness, felling that i dont truly enjoy anything, addictive behaviour, just not functioning in world full of responsibilities, identity crisis - nothing defines me-feelings that im no one, social anxiety, anxiety, weird attachment issues and so on. I honestly thing that i may have BPD. I dont know i also need to be diagnosed with it... Maybe thats part of my identity crisis that i want to be someone, like someon with BPD or ADHD or Social Anxiety... But i just read about so many people that are diagnosed with deppresion, bpd, adhd and other stuff that im kinda jelous that i cant be one of them, or why is it so easy for them to know what exact probmlems they have...\n\nI just want to know what i should do...

She kind of has a fear of commitment and when I do something wrong/stupid  (which happens more often than I'd like to), she tends to shuts down after a while. On the other hand, I have a fear of abandoned and can't cope with strong feelings or to say it directly: I have problems with strong feelings. I basically get overwhelmed or they get so strong I can't manage them and break down (not always but feelings like insecurity, sadness and in some cases anger are very strong). \n\nSo. Recently she wanted to meet with a friend of hers and they wanted to meet that Saturday at night in the city to go eat and maybe drink something. Now, this didn't happen until a week later and here's where the problem started.\n\nFirst, I didn't realize that they would be out that late,  for her it was obvious because they would meet at about  20:00 (8pm) so she assumed I knew it would be 1 or 2 in the morning when we would get home.\nWe said that I would come at some point to spend some time together and take her home so she doesn't have to be in train and subway alone for half an hour on the way home.\n\nSecond, they wanted to smoke something and go eat and maybe drink too and there I lost it basically. She went out with someone I didn't know, to smoke weed, eat and drink in the middle of the next big city until late in the day/early in the morning and  I didn't know how to cope. I started to be stressed immensely and feel bad because I couldn't cope with this (for what I know) generally seen as normal situation.\n\nI had a annoying day at work and the emotional disaster earlier so later when I went there, I got pissed because I couldn't find where they were and had to call her.\nWhen I finally arrived at the place, I didn't see them. There I got more annoyed, because she just told me they would go eat something and next thing they are on top of a parking building between various groups of people drinking and smoking.\nI was annoyed even more and after getting up there and seeing her stoned was like a stab in the heart.\n\nI am probably overreacting but I had a problem with that. I wanted to do that with her again for weeks but always got a no or something came in between, but apparently didn't communicate it clearly so she didn't really know. Second, I want to experiment and experience everything I can with her, and basically don't feel the need to do some things with other people without her and at the same time don't want to. And smoking is one of these things. It hurt seeing her like that and as she told me after, she would probably feel the same way, but basically doesn't stop herself because of feelings like that, which also hurt.\n\nI basically ruined the rest of the night for her, because I arrived pissed off and hurt and even after I calmed down, the tension was there and she couldn't really be there completely.\n\nI feel horrible for ruining her rest of the night, because I can't cope with little things like these and feel like a stab in the heart. I hate that my first thought when she told me how she and her friend went walking in the city by the river and smoked there was \"Why don't we ever do things like this\". I am a jealous, insecure person with a strong sense of protecting people I care about and I am very monogamous. She needs a lot of freedoms that I feel like I can't give her because they would break me. She is interested in an opener relationship and wants to experience everything she can, but I go crazy over a lot of these things and just can't comprehend why anyone would do/want that and I makes me crazy. Even little things like smoking with someone hurt a shit ton and I want to stop feeling this way.

One time my roommate/friend (in the friend group) saw me with a razor in my hand after they heard me crying in my room and asked if I wanted to come out.\n\nThings didn't get much better from there. Later on that month after dissociating for an entire night in a dance competition I was in (I have severe performance anxiety and one time ran out of of the middle of practice when I felt a panic attack coming on) I came back to the party at my house and drank a ton of alcohol and rapidly smoked weed with someone. I just remember knocking back glasses of liquor and taking rapid puffs of a joint, like I was being controlled by an invisible force set on the intention of getting myself into a deplorable state. \n\nI remember really hating myself that day, and I wanted to dig myself deeper into the hole I'd begun to dig. I wanted people to hate me, I wanted a reason to justify my own self hatred.\n\nI blacked out and vomited on the carpet in front of multiple people thereafter. I remember deliriously asking for an ambulance. My consciousness went in and out and hours later I was in the hospital. They sent in a \"crisis assessment team\" where a psychiatrist determined I had BPD- just like my mother, who my father always compared me to whenever I showed any kind of intense emotion. I'd been called crazy, dramatic, and parasitic all my life by him. The sinking feeling I felt in my chest was horrible. I have a lot of trauma from my emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive household. I'm still recovering from the amount of \"baggage\" I got while I was growing up.\n\nI felt even worse for my friends- they'd seen my mental health deteoriate. I wasn't the happy, witty friend they had before, I was something else: I became volatile, bitter, lonely, and angry. I think on the outside that's how I was perceived, but deep down I just hated myself. What hurt was that nobody asked how I was or how I felt after coming back from the ER. F, the friend who picked me up from the hospital, would later go onto telling E that I got diagnosed with BPD. Upon coming home I tried to apologize to P, my roommate at the time, who freaked out and said \"I'm sorry but I can't fucking deal with you right now\".\n\nAfter the hospital I guess they were done with me. They stopped inviting me to come hang out with them, and on the rare occasion they did, they always acted uncomfortable or didn't bother talking to me. At best I'd get one-word responses or general disinterest in whatever I was talking to them about. I tried hard to be the cheerful person I once was, but I was feeling more lonely than ever. I asked one friend, F, what was wrong, and he said nothing was wrong but everyone walked on eggshells around me. I talked about how conflicted and alienated I felt and how I still felt horrible. He said \"that's a real bummer\".\n\nHe stopped texting me and would leave my texts on read.\n\nI texted another friend, E, about what had gone wrong and she said something was going on but she'd talk to me about it. She never texted me again after that.\n\nMy ex-roommate and friend P, who I'd had living conflicts with (they were really messy, I was really clean) responded with \"Ok, that's your call\" after I told them how I didn't feel comfortable in our friend group anymore. I stopped texting after that, because nobody would respond to our groupchat anymore.\n\nI moved on and have only two friends now but I've been feeling better, much more emotionally and mentally independent and stable. I'm seeking treatment. I just feel like I deserved this catastrophe, that I was finally getting the treatment I'd deserved at that time. Something in the back of my mind tells me I'm a chaotic freak, I'm toxic and I deserved all of this to happen. I feel like in their eyes I was no longer their friend struggling with depression and anxiety, I had become \"the borderline\", the person to stay away from.

She was very protective, I didn\u2019t sleep in my own room until I was 13/14 because she couldn\u2019t sleep if she couldn\u2019t see me, and I couldn\u2019t sleep if I couldn\u2019t see her.\n\nI spent years convinced that every stranger I saw wanted to hurt me, and I know that may not sound bad, kids shouldn\u2019t talk to strangers, but I think it may have had a negative impact on my adult brain.\n\nI am very paranoid, I check the backseat of my car every time I get in (even in broad daylight) and even then I\u2019ll still feel 100% sure there\u2019s someone back there and be white knuckling the wheel, every time I have to take my dog out at night I\u2019m freaking out and constantly looking over my shoulder and shaking and hyperventilating by the time I get inside, I get these sudden waves of extreme fear where I feel like I\u2019m in danger and something is chasing me (even if I\u2019m home with my mom in the daylight) and I have to sprint to put my back against a wall.\n\nThis morning, I was laying in bed, just starting to wake up, and I hear a loud banging and crash come from downstairs. I was frozen with fear and it felt like my blood turned to ice, I was 100% convinced someone had broken down our door and was in our house. I wanted to go to my mom\u2019s room to wake her up but I was to scared to move so I just laid there, shaking and crying for almost an hour before I realized nothing was happening. When I went downstairs, nothing was out of place, and when I asked my mom about it later she said she didn\u2019t hear anything. \n\nI just want to stop being afraid. I want to be able to exist in my own home without feeling like I\u2019m about to die.

She wasn\u2019t just your typical alcoholic, she was fucking insane. My sister didn\u2019t help, she got into fights with my mom. I was the younger mommas boy so I had taken my moms side on almost everything. Me and my sister hated each other, she bullied me harshly, degrading my mental state from an early age. Being me I allowed it, after all she was still my sister, just like how I deal with my mom still today. Anyways my sister hated me and I had a bat shit insane asylum patient for a mother. The worst of it was when I was in Jr high. 7th-8th grade. I was severely depressed, I hated myself, I thought I was just gonna end up crazy like my mom. Things changed dramatically when she went to move with her rich boyfriend and left me and my sister to my dad who is great btw. She left for 3+ years which coincidentally were the best years of my life. But some shit happened and after all that she came back. I\u2019m now 17 and a Junior in High school. When she came back feelings, memories, emotions. immediately started pouring back. All the shit she put me and my sister through just scraping the inside of my skull. As time went on from when she got home about a year ago things have just been getting worse inside my head. I got a pocket knife last Christmas thinking it would be cool to have, but on long nights I would glance over at the knife sitting there, thinking about using it, thinking about cutting it into my shoulder, just to feel something. At first it was scary, but then it got easier to do. I had cut my shoulder multiple times. I haven\u2019t don\u2019t it for awhile. I put the knife somewhere else. This last week has been super hard, I\u2019ve been tired all day, I just lie in my bed. I fall asleep during the day which I never used to do. I feel worse than ever, tired of life. I think this is it, I hate it here, what\u2019s the point? Am I meant to just work my whole life just to die anyways? See people treat each other like shit? If anything I might just go out into the wilderness and try to survive but if I die I die. Yes I\u2019ve tried to get help, I\u2019ve talked to my dad about it which was really hard for me, I don\u2019t talk much, I don\u2019t tell people how I feel nor do I really show much emotion. My dad doesn\u2019t believe in that sort of stuff, he thinks I\u2019m just fine and that therapy is just a scam where people tell you what\u2019s wrong with you and give you a pill. My mom on the other hand is supportive, she is much better now although she still drinks. She wants me to go to therapy. So I feel stuck, just laying here in my bed, typing things that I\u2019ll never be able to say out loud. Everyone thinks I\u2019m happy and just fine but they are truly blind to how much I\u2019m struggling. They ask \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And my answer is always just \u201cgood\u201d.

So I don't know where to begin this so I guess I will just start out by saying that I'm currently a senior in high school. I've never really been the most social person growing up as I've always had few friends and I would always find it difficult to form new friendships. Especially in school, I find that everyone is kind and generally friendly towards me yet I feel like all my fellow classmates consider me more as an acquittance than a genuine friend and this goes both ways. I especially feel this when we do group projects and I'm always scrambling to find someone to work with as everyone partners up immediately once the project gets announced.\n\nIt's not that I've not tried to make more friends as when I was new to the school in ninth grade I made an effort to talk with the kids in my grade and attempt to form friendships but it was to no avail. I noticed how despite my attempts at talking to them it didn't make a difference as I never felt like I was truly developing any friendships but rather that they were just being nice to me and responding to what I was saying. Halfway through ninth grade I kind of gave up on actively making friends as I threw myself into my school work. I always said to myself that I'll start making friends and hanging out with people once I get all straight A's in my classes as once that I've conquered the academic aspect of high school I will be able to move on the social aspect of high school. Plus, in my head I knew that I wouldn't see the majority of these people after high school so I didn't mind that I wasn't friends with many of them.\n\nRecently, though one of my classmates died in a car accident and the whole grade attended his funeral. I, myself did not know this person that well but I saw how everyone in my grade was in tears over this person's death. The person who died was generally popular within the grade and had been in the school district since kindergarten while as previously mentioned I moved in ninth grade. Yet, the thing that occurred to me while at the funeral was that if I would have died in that car accident in the place of my fellow classmate would anyone of my fellow classmates care that I was gone compared to him. I honestly believe that while the students and even teachers would be sad it would be no where near as much as the sadness they felt for my fellow classmate.\n\nWhy is that I thought. Well the most obvious answer would be that they simply knew him way better than they knew me as he had many friends and was apart of many different clubs. While, I was apart of a few clubs yet despite only being in a few clubs (three to be exact) I tried many different clubs throughout high school but none of them fit. As I was never interested in Debate, Model UN, or Science Olympiad despite attending multiple meetings for each club. Also, to be honest apart of me didn't like that the amount of public speaking that was involved with each of these clubs. Now let me say that I've sang individually in front of tons of people on numerous occasions and I kind of like the idea of being the center of attention for a brief moment in time. Yet, for some reason when I was in these clubs I was so afraid of actually speaking as I was afraid of what others may think and that they may consider me to be dumb or stupid.\n\nGoing back to school, now that I'm towards the end of my senior year and most of my fellow classmates and myself are receiving our college decisions back I feel a bit disappointed as despite me saying that I'm putting one hundred percent focus in my school work and even foregoing many friendships as a result I still only managed to have a 3.7 unweighted GPA with a 1440 SAT superscore that only happened after taking the exam six times. Also I underperformed on my AP exams in my junior year which is the most crucial year of high school. Alternatively, my peers in school who despite hanging out with friends on weekends and being apart of many different clubs still managed to have a higher GPA, standardized test score, and AP exam score. To be honest, that made me very angry as despite me only focusing on school there were able to focus on so many other things and yet they were still able to succeed in school more than I did.\n\nAt school, I always wanted to be known as the person who was really intelligent. I would love when people would complement me on how smart I was even when I knew deep down it wasn't true as I always had to put in more effort than most students to achieve high grades and even when people asked me how I did on tests I would give a superficial smile and say the highest grade I could think of while also being a little realistic. I'd also get very jealous of the \"smart\" kids in the grade as not only were they super popular and part of a variety of clubs but people would always complement them and things came so naturally to them unlike for me. Even today as I hear back from colleges I'm disappointed that my stats were too low for me to gain admission to any legitimate top twenty school. Even schools that I thought I had a good chance of getting into I did not receive admission such as the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, UCLA, and University of Virginia. I know college admissions is based on luck to a great extent but I still feel angry and disappointed that despite putting my all into my studies I still wasn't able to get the grades that I wanted to attend a top tier school. I always figured that I deserved it since I decided to sacrifice so many other aspects of my life.\n\nNow I also wanted to touch upon my dreams and aspirations. Ever since I was little I always wanted to be an actor I was mesmerized by actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, etc. I also genuinely had a passion for film and I wanted nothing more than to be apart of the process. I expressed this desire to my parents when I was young and even attended some acting classes in the city but nothing much ever came of it. Since then whenever I brought up my desire to pursue an acting or even singing career they told me that it was ridiculous as I don't have the personality to be an actor or a singer in their eyes because of how I'm very introverted and thus should stick to something more practical. But yet even today I still have desires for an acting career as I spend hours watching films and copying facial expressions of famous actors in order to improve my acting ability. I also spend hours vividly daydreaming about what my life maybe like as an actor. I think about the films that I would star in, the plot and title of each film, the A-list actors that would be in the films, and how successful each of my films would be at the box office and with critics. I know it sounds insane talking about it but I'd also spent time daydreaming about winning an Oscar and what exactly I would say when I'd win and which A-list actors would be present to hear my acceptance speech.\n\nI also daydreamed about being apart of a vocal group that I called \"Ultra 5.\" The group would have eight members including myself (four guys and four girls) and we would all live in a two hundred million dollar Bel-Air estate that I had once seen on Zillow. I imagined how I would be filming a movie during the day and then writing music with my fellow \"Ultra 5\" members at night. I imagined that I had the most amount of instagram and twitter followers than anyone in the world by a milestone. I also imagined how I would portray the character of Spiderman in a Spiderman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Then I imagined that while portraying Spiderman I will also play Batman in a film series directed by Aaron Sorkin. I imagined myself being swarmed by fans on a daily basis more than even Michael Jackson. I also imagined how all the members of \"Ultra 5\" will be super famous as well as they will also have the highest instagram and twitter followings right behind me. Also each member of \"Ultra 5\" will dominate in a specific area within the entertainment industry for me that is acting for the other \"Ultra 5\" members that maybe modeling, literary publishing, or directing. I also imagine how out of the four girls of \"Ultra 5\" I would date the most popular and beautiful one who would be a brunette and everyone would see us as a bigger power couple than Brangelina. I'd look at brunette girls my own age on Instagram and imagine that they would be the \"Ultra 5\" member that I would date. Also the second most beautiful \"Ultra 5\" member would be a blonde who would be best friends with the brunette \"Ultra 5\" member and both of them would have major crushes on me and I would have to decide which one I'd want to date.\n\nI'm sorry if that last paragraph was a lot to read but I really wanted you all to understand what is going on in my head for the last few years especially. Another thing that has bothered me for a while especially since I've joined high school was whether or not I was good looking. I always wanted to be an extremely attractive person as I wanted people to admire my looks the way they do for Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt. I constantly asked my family if they thought I was handsome as I was too afraid to ask any of my friends in fear that they would think I was weird or anyone else for that matter. They would always tell me that I am but I always felt like there was a problem as despite even me thinking that I'm handsome, I never got any attention from girls my own age. Now this could be because I barely interact with girls in my school and when I do it is only for school related matters but I always thought even then that at least a few girls would show some interest in me but nothing of the sort ever happened. Furthermore, it is not like the girls in my school don't have crushes on guys as I've heard them speak about their guy crushes in the past and personally I was shocked as I genuinely believe that I'm way better looking than the guys that they were crushing on. I mean it's not like I have a serious crush on any girl in my school in fact I find most of them to be unattractive with the exception of a handful of girls in my grade.\n\nAlso in recent years I've grown to have a strong love for teen dramas. Particularly since the beginning of high school I've watched teen dramas such as Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The Secret Life of The American Teenager, Riverdale, The OC, Beverly Hills 90210, The Vampire Diaries, Freaks &amp; Geeks, and Euphoria. When I'd watch each one of these shows not only did I obsess over the shows but also the cast as I learned so much about each and every one of their professional and personal lives. I would ship characters from the show and be extremely disappointed if they didn't end up together despite me knowing that at the end of the day it doesn't really matter because these characters don't exist in reality. Also being a guy watching teen dramas made me insecure as no other guy my age that I know of spent this much time on teen dramas as they would be more prompted to watch sports or some other show. Don't get me wrong I do watch other shows as I'm a fan of Cobra Kai which while it does have some teen drama in it, it is more of a karate soap opera than a straight up teen drama. Likewise, I also enjoy watching shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy as I've always found them hilarious.\n\nYet, when watching teen dramas I think what appeals to me the most about them is the fact that they are so different from my life as a high school student. As a current senior in high school I've never taken in any drugs or alcohol my whole life. Due to this at times I catch myself judging people in my school who have taken drugs or alcohol as I believe that I have more will power than them and that I must have a better home life that doesn't make me go towards alcohol and drugs. I also constantly search up celebs using drugs as I realize that similar to classmates I shame them to as I can't understand why anyone would do drugs in the first place. Furthermore, one of the things that disappoints me the most in my life is that I've never had a girlfriend, got laid, or even properly kissed. There was a time when I was eight years old that a girl and I shared a kiss for a second but that is the extent of my sexual experiences. I know that this isn't a big deal as plenty of guys my age have yet to have their first proper kiss as well but I still feel like I missed out on that experience that I should have had when I was young.\n\nI told my parents that I wanted to major in business and I'm interested in the business side of the entertainment industry. Additionally, I also said that I could possibly major in Economics and maybe work in an investment banking firm one day. To be honest, the only reason that I would ever want to work in an investment banking firm is so that I could have a lot of money and hopefully retire young and never have to work again. Despite, what I said earlier my parents do want me to pursue my interests as long as it is reasonable. My dad in particular has noticed these past few years that I never really ask for stuff and he always tells me how he is worried about how I'm going to manage in the real world as he thinks I'm too introverted. I believe that while I am indeed introverted I still talk to people and while I don't necessarily go out of my way to make conversation most of the time I still talk confidently when spoken to by an adult or someone my own age. I think my biggest fear is living a life filled with regret. I have been having all these thoughts and emotions for a while now and I really needed a place to vent it all out.\n\nFinally, I want to end off talking about some of my physical tics. My family has noticed over the past year that when I listen to a song I really like I would get out of my chair and stand while clapping my hands with my arms fully extended at the front and back of my body while swaying back and forth. Also, when I get any test back in school my hands start to get pins and needles as I await for the test results. I've noticed that especially this year I've become increasingly disillusioned with school as every day that I'm in school I'm just waiting to get out of school and go home so that I could sit at my desk in my room and watch animated stories or videos by my favorite youtubers. Don't get me wrong I still complete all my homework and study for tests it's just that while I'm doing that I also am also on Youtube watching different videos for hours on end and thus homework that could have taken half an hour now takes two hours. I also stay awake till midnight on weekdays watching videos after I finished all my work as I don't want the day to get over and go to school again in the morning. My dad always asks me why I'm so introverted as he considers me to be the black sheep of the family opposed to him, my brother, and mother. Till date I don't know the true answer. I notice how a lot of the times in school something funny may happen and while the whole class is laughing I'm the only one having to fake the laughter feeling like an outcast.\n\nSo if you can please share with me your thoughts that would be greatly appreciated.", "neg": 0.065, "neu": 0.811, "pos": 0.124, "compound": 0.9997}, {"text": "Well.. i feel like is kind of a minor problem, but in my job is really important to have an Instagram account and take care of it.

I am a 21- year old male living in the US. I'd like to begin by saying that there is something incredibly wrong with me, and I don't quite know what is is. For most of my adolescence years, I was a very lonely kid. I did have friends in Highschool and I did talk to people, but I did not consider them friends because they would rarely invite me out hangout after school. I was always the one singled out in the group. They made plans in front of me all the time.  This has made me sad till this day because why was I shun out? Why did they have to forget me? We all got along in school but when it came to outside of it, nothing. I think this affected me greatly because it started to make my brain think that I have to be a lone wolf.  It made me think, \" Well, if they wanna leave my life, that's okay, I'll do it ALL myself. MYSELF. I feel like my brain has conditioned me to eventually become alone. Now, I also have been in multiple relationships. They have all ended in heartbreak, including my most recent relationship, which was with a girl who did everything right. All my other relationships did not have the love she showed me. However, we broke up for multiple reasons on my part. Now, this is where it gets interesting and where the problem lies. For some reason, these relationships always end in heartbreak one way or another. I thought if I'd find a good girl, things would change but obviously that was not the case. The weirdest thing about this tho is that I have cried at least once in all of these relationships. it is usually because of miscommunications or something else, but when I cry, I cry loud. I start crying hard and shouting while driving in the car. Now, as weird as this sounds, I feel like my brain feels comfort after these disastrous  events that make me cry. it's as if my brain subconsciously set me up just to get me cry afterwards and feel all the chemicals in my brain. I realized I might be addicted to those chemicals now. Another thing I struggle is loving myself I believe. This is because I am always having terrible meltdowns due to the fact that I do terrible things that would in a way consider me a bad person. But here's the thing, I am the most open minded, loving, kid, empathetic human I know. At times, I show love, happiness, and overall a differently personality. I become a better person! this was especially with my last relationship because like I said, this was a good girl who always tried to help me. Now....I said we broke up for multiple reasons because of me. Well, I never got the chance to really tell her why we broke up and in fact I still don't know why I broke up with her! I thought it was because I lost feelings naturally, but now I'm not so sure because I have realized that maybe I broke up with her because my good subconscious side told me that I need to grow and become mature. That I am not ready for a relationship. That I need to leave now. now I'd be lying if this was the complete truth, but I also broke up wit her because I did feel like I lost some feelings for her and \" I was not ready to commit\"... because I am not. I don't know if that's  because I just didn't feel the spark with  my ex anymore or because I wanted to screw around. I won't  lie, I watch porn a lot and get tempted to check out girls and stuff and with media online, girls are everywhere. I am pretty sure I am a sex addict because I never think about the consequences . In the moment, this lust feels great but after weeks, I become sad because I know this is just me being addicted. Also smoke weed everyday now. and addicted to that too. SO....now I am trying to fight the porn addiction, the sex addiction, the bad side of me vs my good side... I feel like I'm two people and the bad side is winning by a lot so far. Maybe I have BPD with something on the side haha. I think the addiction to heartbreak comes from a self defense mechanism from when I was younger. somehow, my brain was taught to think of the worst case scenario, and take measures to prevent that and basically make everything perfect. but when it doesn't work, I cry because of the pain and yet feel sort of a rush of emotions together which makes me cry harder and yet again,reviver a larger rush of excitement/relief/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat do u guys think", "neg": 0.177, "neu": 0.707, "pos": 0.116, "compound": -0.996}, {"text": "There\u2019s so much going on with me and being around others.

I have no fucking right to not be okay. I see a goddam therapist, how fucking privileged could I be? How supremely lucky could I be in this day in age to be able to get into a therapist on a fortnightly basis? I have no fucking traumatic life events. I'm just a 25 y/o privileged Australian white cisgender woman with middle class parents and a full-time job that gets me out of my head for 45 hours a week. \n\nAnyway. Fuck I don't know. I just don't have anywhere I share this - mostly because therapy isn't for another week. I have friends I can talk to, who are incredible people - again, I'm so lucky to have the friends I have. Incredibly lucky, to be honest. I think I'm just good at putting on a lil facade so they still like me even though I'm just no fuckin good. \n\nAnd this is so fucking embarrassing, because the topic is 'on trend'. \n\nI hoped I had ADHD. My friend 29F was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, and I was talking to her about how my housemates doctor suggested she might have ADHD, and how I was surprised because she's not what I considered 'ADHD'. To me she seems focused, motivated, very academic, on top of everything, and really good at putting aside leisure for getting work done first (everything I absolutely am not). I know she has some mental health issues, but she seems to manage them really well. I made a joke about how if someone like that could potentially have ADHD then by god I've gotta have it. (Note: I am very aware I was not in the session with my housemate and her doctor, and she very well could be masking a lot of symptoms! No intention to undermine her experience at all. I love her dearly, she's a very good friend.) \n\nMy 29F friend was like... 'oh, I mean, you definitely have ADHD. You have all the symptoms I have. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to explore that?' and so I did, and I came to the conclusion that shit, I might? Have ADHD? \n\nRight? Watching too much Tiktok, much? \n\nBut it was in my head. I am really forgetful. I am really bad at focusing on tasks. I get distracted VERY easily (I used to regularly leave the stove on until I got on a rigorous habit of checking every individual knob all the time, even when I'm not cooking). I can't do anything academic until the last minute and then I'll spend 6-12 hours doing nothing but the thing and get a good grade so no one is the wiser, except the tutor who sees me chugging half a litre of energy drink the next day in class, because I probably haven't slept a wink. Unless there is a task I urgently need to do, I'll do absolutely nothing at home, or I'll prioritise stupid things like playing video games, or thinking about playing video games but actually just laying in bed stuck on Instagram or something until it's too late for videogames and I realise I didn't wash my work uniform so I have to do that immediately and force myself awake until it finishes. \n\nSo I saw a psychologist. She's great, a very good psychologist who has taken my bullshit in stride and is very attentive. \n\nAs well as unpacking my previous history of risk taking and inserting myself into dangerous situations, we started exploring ADHD.  \n\nShe was leaning towards ADHD after my first round of tests, but after talking to my Mum and doing some additional testing, she told me she didn't think I had ADHD, and rather that I may have a learning disorder (but she wasn't sure yet if my results were statistically significant)\n\nI'll get the report on Wednesday and find out. \n\nMy mum has since done some research into ADHD, and she does feel that my Dad and I do have it, and she was going to email my psychologist some additional info, but she's left it too late (my fault, I didn't think to tell her when the report was being finalised), so I've told her not to worry about it. \n\nAnyway. That's the backstory. It's a lot of text but it's just my overly wordy way of saying 'waaah waaah, privileged white woman wanted to be neurodivergent so she wasn't just a lazy fuck'\n\nBut I'm not neurodivergent. And yes, if I have a learning disorder, that is still valuable information (and there were some significant deficits in my testing that support the learning disorder theory) - and not shameful or bad at all.\n\nBut if I do have a learning disorder, that isn't treatable. That's not fixable, and frankly does not account for the characteristics in myself that I fucking hate. ADHD might have, and ADHD is treatable. But I don't have that. \n\nSo I'm just... A lazy fuck. The horrible little voice in my head that's been telling me that for most of my life was right. I had hoped this testing might have proved it wrong, but it proved the voice right. \n\nAnd I fucking hate it. I fucking hate myself. I fucking hate that I thought there might have been an excuse for this behaviour, but it's just laziness and privilege that has made me like this, and maybe I should just work harder at being a better human but it feels completely impossible. I can't be more. I don't have a little voice in my brain that says 'hey, maybe it's time to do your laundry'. I have 'hey fucker let's become one with the floor and maybe the pile of laundry will fucking suffocate you and then you don't have to do it'\n\nI don't know. I think I on some level am blaming my mum for not contacting my psych sooner, but I know it's my fault for not giving her the details. And really, I should trust my psychologist's skills of assessment. It's not like this is her first rodeo. I just don't want to accept that i'm just awful and lazy and unlovable, but I am. Over $1k into testing doesnt change that. \n\nIt just proves that the only reason I've come this far is my profound privilege. \n\nIf you made it this far, holy crap, you're pretty incredible. \n\nTL;DR\nI wanted to have ADHD because it's trendy but I probably don't have ADHD, I'm just a lazy privileged fuck which is /not/ trendy.", "neg": 0.13, "neu": 0.735, "pos": 0.136, "compound": -0.8396}, {"text": "I just broke up with my long term girlfriend because of a few issues I don\u2019t really want to get into.

However lately I've been waking up at night or very early in the morning in the middle of a panic attack. I cannot keep it under control as I don't feel it coming.

No one really cared for me, I had to learn proper hygiene by myself, I developed body odor at 8yrs.old,, which I was bullied more because of it. I only got to see my mom after 7 years, which was first hug I felt in 7 years, I almost cried but held it until I was alone. I found out my dad is cheating on my mom ever since. Since then, I was always mad for no reason, even started fights with my parents and brothers. Fast forward a bit&gt;&gt;&gt; my mom left again.

I woke up the next morning and went to school like nothing happened. ( I had my own bedroom eversince I was 4) My parents never knew this attempt. And they will never know. At 14 I tried to kill myself once more, again I failed. But this time, one of my cousins knew so he told my mom, and my mom who had a great career overseas, threw it all because of me.

Was thinking of trying esketamine, but they stopped adding new patients for that for a bit, because covid, since it's in person. Eventually, however, had to hide my gender identity from her as she was super conservative, which I hadn't realized at the start.\n\nCouples Therapist #1 - Generally liked her, felt things were improving in some ways here. Unfortunately had only 3 days a week where she saw patients, and my wife got a job that made seeing her not possible\n\nGender Identity Therapist - Been super great. If it weren't for him, might have given up on therapy entirely with my lackluster results. Still seeing.\n\nPsychiatrist #5 - Mostly has been slooowly taking me off everything psychiatrist #4 put me on, hadn't really had any novel ideas, kinda disappointed. Did suggest I try TMS. Still seeing\n\nTMS - Had a rough go of it. Had to wake up early for a few months, couldn't use their preferred machine due to jaw pain with teeth clenching activated by the TMS. Immediately began having regular nightmares and waking in the middle of the night, they tried adjusting the protocol (making the sessions even longer), but to no effect. Felt they weren't particularly listening and just collecting a big insurance payout for little work.\n\nCouples Therapist #2 - Been also really great, but we've gotten to a point where we're past some points of tension and others are more unchangeable, so there's not much to talk about, so we've put it on pause for a little bit. Still content with the therapist and things are pretty good with my wife.\n\nRegular Therapist #4 - Seemed waaaay too handholdy - 'here, read this and we'll discuss' me: reads 4 chairs in a week 'Hey, I read the first 4 chapters' 'Great, let me spend our time reading verbatim from it and waking you through simple examples that you already filled in in your copy'. Then, she recommended homeopathic treatments. I said, no, don't suggest that again, I don't give any scientific backing in it. 3 weeks later, she suggests it again. I peace out\n\nRegular Therapist #5 - After the second session, feels she needs to hand me to someone with more eating experience (in eating disorders, I presume?)\n\nRegular Therapist #6 - Seems alright, but never sticks to any one method.

I had been in the same school for the last (almost) 10 years but it only went up to the 9th grade so I eventually had to change schools. I felt very anxious a few days before my first day, nothing out of the ordinary, but eventually I could talk with no problem to anyone in the class. \n\nBut recently, there have been these two guys in my class that keep making \"no dad\" jokes (if you can even call those jokes). Like, you can be talking about something with another person and they'll just intervene and say \"but you have no dad\". Stuff like that. But before all this started, I was walking with one of the guys to my bus stop, the guy is kind of a class clown but he seemed cool at the time, so I told him about the relationship I had with my father. My parents are divorced and my dad is currently homeless and a drug addict. He's tried to treat himself a few times but to no avail. So, as I was telling the guy what my relationship with my father was like he constantly tried to change the subject by making jokes (not about what I was talking about though). I stopped since I thought he wasn't comfortable talking about it with me. \n\nSome weeks later, we're walking to the bus stop again but there's the other guy with us, and they're making these dad jokes. Stuff along the lines of: \"Hey, look at the sky. Do you see your dad?\". I didn't take it seriously because it wasn't completely directed at me. After a while I started getting a bit bothered, but not anything to make me lose my cool, and then the guy I told about my father turns to me and says \"Atleast my dad isn't homeless and a drug addict\". My heart sank when I heard that. The other guy probably just thought it was another generic joke, but it wasn't. It really hit me, but I just laughed it off. \n\nWhen I got home, I messaged the guy, talking calmly about the situation and why I didn't like it when he said stuff like that. He said \"no problem\" and that he wouldn't repeat it again. Everything after that was normal. Then about a week later, we're walking to the bus stop after school again and we were talking about gifts our parents got us. And he just turns to me and says: \"Dude, when even was the last time your dad gave you a gift?\". And I brushed it off, trying to ignore the passive aggressiveness, and I told him about the time my dad gave me a tablet and I broke it because of a video-game. We laughed a bit and continued talking about the same subject. I don't remember perfectly, but we were talking about father's day gifts or something like that, and he just turns to me and says \"How about you give your dad something to sniff just how he likes it?\". Me, him and two other guys that were with us went completely silent. Thing is, it didn't look like he said it as a joke, he was dead serious. But I tried ignoring it for the rest of the walk to the bus stop.\n\nThen yesterday (Father's day where I live), he sent me a text saying \"Happy father's day, oh yeah, you don't have one\". I snapped, and sent about 4 or 5 messages saying that I was getting tired of those comments and that how it sounded like he wasn't joking anymore but trying to hurt me. I was put off by it the rest of the day. He replied a few hours later with a voice message saying that he didn't know that I got so offended by what he said but that he wasn't lying. I have no idea why, but I feel guilty for having snapped. I know that I'm right and that he shouldn't just throw the fact that my father is not present to my face. But I still feel bad for having snapped. The worst part is that I'm sure he'll say it again and I'm afraid that I'll lose my cool while I'm at school and do something I'll regret.

However, they've recently told me that they have a \"favorite person\". \n\nA \"favorite person\" (pardon my terrible explanation) is someone who people with BPD become obsessed with and this is something that is not chosen by them. They view this person as perfect and have intense feelings/emotions when it comes to them. They seek validation from them for everything and however they're treated by them is how they feel, and this means whether they feel good or bad about themselves. Even as their partner, your impact on them pales in comparison to the favorite person's actions. Their whole world and sense of belonging revolve around this favorite person. \n\nMy partner has been clear that although these feelings are intense, they aren't love and that they love no one else but me. And I trust them, and the fact that they opened up to me about having a \"favorite person\" only helps me trust them more. However, it's been such a stressful and emotionally painful thing for me to handle.\n\nI've never been an emotionally strong person but I love them so much and even knowing their conditions, I've strived to be there for them and love them. And though things have been rocky especially due to us being in a long distance relationship, we've made things work through all the tough times. However, hearing about this \"favorite person\" has filled my mind with stress and anxiety and I don't know how to deal with it.\n\nThere are two main reasons why this has been so hard to deal with.\n\n1) I've always been there to support my partner when they're feeling down. It's very common for my partner to have breakdowns and I've tried my best to comfort them every time. I reassure them the best I can and type my heart out to make them feel better. And though I manage to somewhat make them feel a bit better, it's never much, and it never lasts. Usually the things I say are taken out of context or go in one ear and through the other. This is common due to their mental condition, but it hasn't stopped me from trying to constantly send them love and comfort. And I'm going to sound absolutely selfish and childish and inconsiderate for their condition, but, for their brain to find someone else, who doesn't even see them the way I do and have them put in less effort just to do so much more than I could've ever achieved to help them through their pain, and brighten up their day, even with all the love and tears I put into comforting and sending them love is so heartbreaking to me. And at this point I feel like I'm just victimizing myself or something. I know this is part of the condition and it's genuinely not their fault. It's not something that I can just blame on someone. I just feel so many negative emotions that I don't mean but can't control. I feel jealous and angry and powerless. These aren't feelings that anyone deserves but I still feel these things. It's just so easy to think, \"well what am I doing here?\" \"Do I even matter?\" And I know the answers to these questions but I still can't stop myself from asking them.\n\n2) I'm a very jealous person, especially when it comes to my partner. However, despite having had many toxic and controlling thoughts in the past, it's something I've worked on and I don't really have to deal with much now. An example of this is me being very anxious when they would hang around those of the opposite sex. I've overcame thoughts like those by instead trusting my partner and believing in their love for me. However, the thought of them obsessing over someone else absolutely triggers my jealousy and anxiety. I know they love me very much and though this is genuinely the case, their mind and body thinks otherwise, instead obsessing over someone else. It's such a complicated situation. I am a horrible overthinker. At times when I think too hard, it almost feels like emotional cheating BUT I know this isn't true and again, this isn't something they chose or can control. However, when my stress and anxiety go up, my overthinking goes rampant, feeding oil to the flames wherever they can. In the past, they've often took these feelings for other \"favorite people\" romantically due to the intensity of these feelings and I have a constant fear of it pushing them to do things which would undermine our own relationship. It also doesn't help that social media has pushed a lot of toxic and negative thoughts into my head about things like this.\n\nDespite these reasons, I want to make clear that I understand that this \"favorite person\" is involuntary and my partner is in no way responsible for any of this. In fact they suffer very much from this as well, often telling me how much they love me and hating that they have these feelings for another person. Sad as it may be, there isn't much to be done about it and I want to do my best to continue to support and stay strong for them.

Both to the tone policer, and hopefully one that anyone who has been targeted for tone policing can learn from.\n\nTone policing is a variant on gaslighting. Essentially, one can present the most irrefutable argument and the opposition, knowing that what they have to say is going down in flames, will tell you to say it nicely as a way of derailing you.\n\nTo use an example from my real life, there was a time during which my sister would grab me by the genitals and squeeze/twist just for the fun of it. Eventually, after doing this one too many times, I punched her in the head so hard that she fell to the ground and screamed.\n\nHours later, my masculine gene pool shitter, aka Shitbreath, called me up for an explanation. I very calmly stated that sister had been for over a month grabbing my nuts or balls or whatever and hurting me, and because I knew he would not do anything, I took matters into my own hands and punched her.\n\nShitbreath said, quote, \"Testicles, Baphomet In Steel\" and would not make another sound. Just lied back with his eyes closed and would not even acknowledge my presence, no matter how loudly and angrily I tried to remind him that **she** was the one who assaulted **me** in the beginning. Grabbing a person's genitals and mashing them like that is, in fact, sexual assault. I should have called the cops.\n\nBut anyway, Shitbreath's behaviour is an example of Tone Policing. That is, he told me to say it the way he wanted, and then refused to even listen to me. To this day I have all manner of regret trips circling in my head ranging from regretting not physically attacking him to not going and getting petrol and setting him on fire. A great memory to have from when you were twelve years old.\n\nOh, and just in case you thought sister was the only member of the Shitbreath family who has sexually assaulted me... well, you get the idea. Are they going to say that in court? Testicles, Baphomet In Steel? I would love to see how the judge responds to that.\n\nWhen you violate my personal space or my body, you have no right to tell me I have to be polite to you.

He argues that tone policing is a means to deflect attention from injustice and **relocate the problem in the style of the complaint, rather than address the complaint itself.**\" I pasted them here so you cannot refuse to read the link and not see this point.

I have been way more stressed recently as I'm doing a DBT program, and in doing this I've stopped numbing myself and all the trauma I've been withholding is finally unleashing its fiery wrath upon me. It doesn't help that I live with the very same people giving me that trauma, and I don't know if there is anything I can do about it (or can I? I wouldn't know, I'm pretty sure I've been gaslighted for years). I also do weed semi-occasionally (every now and then, but it's consistent in that it always happened eventually - for the past 2-3 years). I'm assuming this is definitely the culprit of these weird derealization moments.\n\nSo here's what happens: when I get insanely stressed (and that's saying a lot since literally, every single day is just stress), I try to use some distress tolerance skills. It works for a bit to cause me not to have an ACTUAL breakdown (usually because I have to do something at hand, and don't have the ability to breakdown right now). But then, I get sleepy. REALLY sleepy. Once I close my eyes and drift off, the people talking soon become muffled noises, and then to voices that I straight up... don't hear?? Except I do hear them and I know they're talking, but I get so absorbed in my mind because of that sleepiness that, although I register that they're talking, some part of my brain turns off that comprehension/awareness component...? Like it suddenly doesn't care about the fact that there is literally sound in my near surroundings.\n\nThen, when I drift off, my mind is literally running at like an insane speed on different topics. I have never even been able to recall ONE topic. I just know that it's a bunch going at a very very fast speed, although it feels like I'm still able to somehow cover these topics in-depth, despite the fast speed. It feels like I'm sleeping, except I'm not... exactly.\n\nThe second time around, the same sort of things started happening, I drift off, my mind disconnects from reality... but then today, everybody collectively stood up (I was in a church), and I heard rain instead? Like as if I was simply listening to really heavy rain hitting my house or something. It was either rain or just a really big overwhelming noise that I probably attributed to rain because of how loud rain is, too.\n\nOnce I'm awake from this, I feel better. My mind stopped focusing on those really big stressors and I just got to rest for a bit, even though there were some really weird side effects to it. And, even though I'm pretty sure this is a pretty concerning issue, I also kinda don't want it to stop - it's the only way I've gotten my mind to fully just stop and allow me to reenter my surroundings as if nothing happened, which is honestly what I want really badly. I'd do anything to stop thinking about these things for a moment, even if I have to undergo that weird process.\n\nAside from that, though, does anybody have any idea what this is or what it's called?", "neg": 0.099, "neu": 0.809, "pos": 0.092, "compound": 0.4656}, {"text": "\"To cure BPD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full remission\"\n\nJust a thought experiment, when you read the quote, substitute the word BPD, and change it to any physical illness, and ask yourself whether you would ever accept that as a good enough answer. To me that says nothing, like its as vague as it gets, while covering all angles.\n\nIm 22 and first time i had to go to therapy was in London, age 11 as social services came to my house and determined we had to have family therapy. Well lets just say the family part didn't register for my dad, as he just couldn't accept he was doing anything wrong, in fact, he was convinced no family would want me, and made it know. I went to therapy at 11 thinking i had to be fixed, and after only half a year of weekly sessions, i stopped going. I'd continue with my life have a couple months where you'd think im completely normal until inevitably i wasn't. \n\nThis is what i did every single year till my 19th birthday. Always going to the therapist thinking im a broken watch that needs fixing, worst of all thinking someone knew how to fix it. Looking back, im surprised i didn't just give up sooner. As soon as i finished one therapy, my parents would find another, everytime telling me \"this guy is really different, hes the real deal\" and i would believe it. I guess i really had no choice but to believe it, from a young age i knew i couldn't live that sort of life. From ages 11-18 i probably saw around 9 different therapists, from private to public, ive tried psychoanalysis, EMDR, hypnotherapy, family therapy i mean you name it I've done it.\n\nI never got the cure i was looking for, instead what i did get is a different diagnosis each time; clinical depression, something like problems with authority, social anxiety, agoraphobia, depersonalisation, de realisation. I mean fuck, they threw the whole book at me and with that the more i felt like i needed to be cured. Clearly i was all the way fucked, further proven by the fact that at 18 i still had the same issues i had at 11. Having said this, i never questioned the therapies, clearly i was doing something wrong, or so i was made to believe.\n\nAs is expected, after trying so many things while seeing 0 results what so ever, this being when i was 18, i was very much ready to just call it quits. This time i was more serious than ever, suicide was nothing new to me, but it was always in the somewhat near future. Not this time. This crisis was my lowest and toughest to that point, and if i hadn't made the following decision its very likely i wouldn't be here now. (It always fascinates me how strong our will to survive really is)\n\nUntil now, i still didn't have the diagnosis of BPD, i didn't know it existed. During this time as per usual, my parents were looking for the next best thing although this time it was different. My parents lived in spain at that point (i was living in london by myself) and they explained how there was this BPD diagnosis that really seemed to fit my problems, and that there was this amazing day hospital in Madrid that was known world wide for being extremely good. I thought to myself, might as well try it for a couple months, i aint got shit to lose anyways.\n\nSoon after, i ended up back in Madrid and going to a day hospital which was specialised in first psychotic epsisodes, which also happened to accept BPD, due to the fact that the one in charge actually specialised in BPD. This was no joke \"95%\" success rate. Im not gonna lie the first few months went better than i could have imagined, fuck for the first time i was able to put a name to my problems, and not 10 different diagnosis. I had a therapist which clearly knew what i was talking about, which seems normal, but in my case very new. This was the first time in 10 years that i thought to myself, this is it, finally. \n\nI really put an effort to go every day, whenever we were given what i considered \"stupid\" shit in occupational therapy i put my ego asside, i volunteered in anything they offered. I mean shit i was giving it my all. The night before my first day i'd promised myself i would give everything i could, including making myself talk in every session, no exceptions. At first i started to see some very obvious changes, i mean shit suddenly i didn't feel different, judged, misunderstood. We would have group therapies twice a week, and suddenly i realised my problems arent just mine, and turns out people have had it even worse. I guess you could call this the honeymoon period, and very useful at that, everyday that passed the closer i saw an end line (which to me was crazy, as for 10 years i couldn't see past the next day), i was gaining so much insight, the anger i felt towards my parents was getting smaller thanks to venting during therapies. I still was in complete awe of my psychiatrist, never had i felt like a therapist always seemed to understand everything i talked about. Really it was going as i hoped it would.\n\nMonths went by, a year went by, and two years went by and at no point did i realise it was long ago i last saw a change. The last two years of me going to therapy was the same it always was, except this time i never stopped to question whether i was improving any longer. I was just going through the motions, wake up, go to therapy, talk about your problems, sleep... every day until the inevitable crisis came. And once again wake up, go to therapy, talk about my problems and so on. Suddenly, therapy is all i knew and ironically at that point my stigma was even worse to how it was in London. But i just continued, whenever i had a crisis i was told that every crisis teaches you something new, that it was my fault cos clearly i was doing something wrong. Once the crisis was no longer there id have my ego boosted by all the staff saying how much better i looked, how very soon ill be able to leave and have a normal life. \n\nI believed all of this, not once did i question the therapy, i just trusted my psychiatrist whenever hed tell me i just need q bit more time, and try this and try that. Within two and a half years of being in the center, i had been hospitalised plenty of times from the reoccurring crisis, basically failed to accomplish every single task i set myself. However this is easy say with hindsight, because let me tell you, even at this point i had this blind faith that this was all part of the bigger picture, that i had learned something different and that \"soon\" id be cured. \n\nJust 3 months before i was let go, the cure seemed to be right in front of me. Things seemed to be going fine, i was gonna start school in a month, all the therapists said i had done it. Shit it really seemed that way, at that moment anyways. School started, suprise surprise yet another crisis, although this time, i had a pretty serious overdose. But just like always as soon as i composed myself i went back to the day hospital, apologised, asked to get another chance (this still blows my mind) and was accepted back in. With no time to waste, my therapist made it very clear, if you cant study you have to work. Not one week later i found a job in construction as i was told, after a couple weeks i seemed to be in crisis again. I let my therapist know, but as always told me to ignore the symptoms and continue as i had to fight it. Only lasted two weeks until the next crisis came, and with that a couple more overdoses. Once again i was feeling that desperation i had long forgoten, i started to realise this shit aint going nowhere.\n\nAs what had now become a norm, as soon as i was able to function again, i went back to the day hospital with an apology in mind. I sat in my therapists office, and before i could say anything i was given the news i could no longer go there. It was surreal, that feeling of being a family, that i was somehow special because i was the only one with BPD that was left. Stroking my ego as I'd convince myself i was working harder, listening better than all the other ones woth my disorder. And realising its just happened to me.\n\nIts been almost 3 months since that happened. First month was very difficult, with very negative a destructive thoughts and behaviours. At some point i started reflecting on the situation. They way i was just suddenly let go didnt feel right, i couldn't figure out why, but it didn't. It was like a puzzle, slowly finding more pieces. Except each piece had q question, not an answer. First thing was, how did he go from telling me hes so proud of my hard work to saying since i started i have just done things my way? Did i really not follow his method?.\n\nI didn't really go any further than that until the following day. I was in the terrace, and idk how to explain this, other than everything just made sense. But this didn't bring me peace, quite the opposite. Had i ever seen q single person \"cured\" since i was there? No. Why is it that all 9 pacients with BPD were kicked out for \"not following treatment\"? Why did i get a tattoo of my therapist? Why have i told everyone hes saved my life? Why was i so convinced that i was always about to be cured? Not one time did i stop to realise i was literally having the same crisis, with the sam frequency, with the same anxiety etc as always. How the fuck is this possible? What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck did he get his reputation from? And why have i idolised him, so blindly without having seen any sort of proof?\n\nI mean the idea, of not having solved a single one of my issues was completely crazy. I thought i was having a psychotic episode. I really just couldn't comprehend wtf was going on. How is it possible, that i was so sure that the end line was always just a couple steps infront of me, yet nothings changed. Its hard to even put in words what i was feeling, but best way of discribing is that to me the realisation of this therapy having been no difference just seemed IMPOSSIBLE. I mean what about the 2 and a half years of therapy i just did, in this \"amazing\" day hospital, with \"one of THE best BPD therapists\" in the world. Always being reminded how lucky we were to be here, just like threating to let someone else \"take advantage\" instead of us. \n\nI was so confused that i was sure i had just spent 3 years in a cult. I couldn't find any other way to explain any of this. Everything just screamed cult, from the first day, where you get greeted by the \"veterans\", saying how you've finally found the right place, instantly just in awe of my therapist (never happened before), shit even my dad was in love with him. Scratch that, everyone was he comes we shut up and listen. The way they tell you that they have the key that no one else does. The way youd have to apologise and ask for more chances as if it was my fault, id get crisis trying what THEY told me to do. Not once in that time did i question weather things were working, everytime a friend was let go, I'd always get angry at them, as if it was their fault. I mean this one i cringe just saying it, but if there was a new guy that didn't wanna stay, me \"as a veteran\" would say to his face how he was wasting the chance of his life etc with such fucking conviction and somewhat superiority that still just makes my brain hurt. How? Saying it out loud just makes me feel retarded, and confused. Wtf did i really do all this time. How is any of this posible.\n\nTook me a couple days to calm down, and only then did it occur to me that theres no way a public day hospital is a cult. But that doesn't mean it acts like one, giving hope to people that don't have it, promising a cure IF they follow the \"method\", insisting whenever you're not in crisis that youre almost cured, while blaming all the tough moments on you, until they let you go for \"not complying\". Either way, its a fullproof method, if you get cured its thanks to the treatment, if you dont its pacients fault.\n\nTo this day, this shit feels like a big fucking manipulation, feels like ive been living a lie, that ive been played with. I decided to share my thoughts with all people from the center that i'd shared time to see what they thought. I can't lie up to this point i was still thinking i was probably psychotic. But no, ALL of them had the same experience. Not of the therapist being bad, no, of feeling played, lied to. I cant put my finger on what the centre is doing wrong, but something here is discusting.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why did i use that title?\nEven though i still have a hard time making sense of this. One thing is very apparent to me, I've been looking at it all wrong. There is no step by step method, no one has one. If they did they'd be rich and famous, and in fact the clinical studies indicate that the only known \"cure\" is time. This means im now free to find what works for me, which means its MY responsibility. This probably sounds so obvious but keep in mind since i was 11 this is what ive been told. Its very obvious many aspects of psychology are where medical science was 200 years ago. People theorising, with/without esucated guesses.\nIn no other field could you say \n\n\"To cure BPD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full remission\"\n\nCONCLUSION: Obviously this is a personal experience, and i only realised the \"fraud\" in the therapies claiming they have the special sauce after having spent half my life in these places. I still see the use in therapy for BPD, so long you have the right expectations and don't expect to be cured by someone other than you. Also once you've done enough therapy, start thinking for yourself + knowledge learnt. You're idea will be as good as the therapists (pure guess). \n\nP.S. the day hospital has its positives; socialize with people like you, you feel understood, you have a daily routine, i learned a lot about myself through talking. All of this is more than any other therapy has done for me. I wanna make clear my issue, is with the fact that that promise a cure which doesn't exist, drag you along for years and when at some point give up and blame it on the patient. I think this is a very useful tool, just not the tool they advertise. Im not exaggerating, in terms of our difficulties, all 9 of us, are exactly where we started off. in our houses, confused on whats next.\n\nInterested to get feedback or questions", "neg": 0.13, "neu": 0.76, "pos": 0.109, "compound": -0.998}, {"text": "I would say I am still very young at age 18F but I've had this constant belief that I wouldn't make it as far as I have and now I'm just dragging along now.

So I don't know where to begin this so I guess I will just start out by saying that I'm currently a senior in high school. I've never really been the most social person growing up as I've always had few friends and I would always find it difficult to form new friendships. Especially in school, I find that everyone is kind and generally friendly towards me yet I feel like all my fellow classmates consider me more as an acquittance than a genuine friend and this goes both ways. I especially feel this when we do group projects and I'm always scrambling to find someone to work with as everyone partners up immediately once the project gets announced. \n\nIt's not that I've not tried to make more friends as when I was new to the school in ninth grade I made an effort to talk with the kids in my grade and attempt to form friendships but it was to no avail. I noticed how despite my attempts at talking to them it didn't make a difference as I never felt like I was truly developing any friendships but rather that they were just being nice to me and responding to what I was saying. Halfway through ninth grade I kind of gave up on actively making friends as I threw myself into my school work. I always said to myself that I'll start making friends and hanging out with people once I get all straight A's in my classes as once that I've conquered the academic aspect of high school I will be able to move on the social aspect of high school. Plus, in my head I knew that I wouldn't see the majority of these people after high school so I didn't mind that I wasn't friends with many of them. \n\nRecently, though one of my classmates died in a car accident and the whole grade attended his funeral. I, myself did not know this person that well but I saw how everyone in my grade was in tears over this person's death. The person who died was generally popular within the grade and had been in the school district since kindergarten while as previously mentioned I moved in ninth grade. Yet, the thing that occurred to me while at the funeral was that if I would have died in that car accident in the place of my fellow classmate would anyone of my fellow classmates care that I was gone compared to him. I honestly believe that while the students and even teachers would be sad it would be no where near as much as the sadness they felt for my fellow classmate. \n\nWhy is that I thought. Well the most obvious answer would be that they simply knew him way better than they knew me as he had many friends and was apart of many different clubs. While, I was apart of a few clubs yet despite only being in a few clubs (three to be exact) I tried many different clubs throughout high school but none of them fit. As I was never interested in Debate, Model UN, or Science Olympiad despite attending multiple meetings for each club. Also, to be honest apart of me didn't like that the amount of public speaking that was involved with each of these clubs. Now let me say that I've sang individually in front of tons of people on numerous occasions and I kind of like the idea of being the center of attention for a brief moment in time. Yet, for some reason when I was in these clubs I was so afraid of actually speaking as I was afraid of what others may think and that they may consider me to be dumb or stupid. \n\nGoing back to school, now that I'm towards the end of my senior year and most of my fellow classmates and myself are receiving our college decisions back I feel a bit disappointed as despite me saying that I'm putting one hundred percent focus in my school work and even foregoing many friendships as a result I still only managed to have a 3.7 unweighted GPA with a 1440 SAT superscore that only happened after taking the exam six times. Also I underperformed on my AP exams in my junior year which is the most crucial year of high school. Alternatively, my peers in school who despite hanging out with friends on weekends and being apart of many different clubs still managed to have a higher GPA, standardized test score, and AP exam score. To be honest, that made me very angry as despite me only focusing on school there were able to focus on so many other things and yet they were still able to succeed in school more than I did. \n\nAt school, I always wanted to be known as the person who was really intelligent. I would love when people would complement me on how smart  I was even when I knew deep down it wasn't true as I always had to put in more effort than most students to achieve high grades and even when people asked me how I did on tests I would give a superficial smile and say the highest grade I could think of while also being a little realistic. I'd also get very jealous of the \"smart\" kids in the grade as not only were they super popular and part of a variety of clubs but people would always complement them and  things came so naturally to them unlike for me. Even today as I hear back from colleges I'm disappointed that my stats were too low for me to gain admission to any legitimate top twenty school. Even schools that I thought I had a good chance of getting into I did not receive admission such as the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, UCLA, and University of Virginia. I know college admissions is based on luck to a great extent but I still feel angry and disappointed that despite putting my all into my studies I still wasn't able to get the grades that I wanted to attend a top tier school. I always figured that I deserved it since I decided to sacrifice so many other aspects of my life. \n\nNow I also wanted to touch upon my dreams and aspirations. Ever since I was little I always wanted to be an actor I was mesmerized by actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, etc. I also genuinely had a passion for film and I wanted nothing more than to be apart of the process. I expressed this desire to my parents when I was young and even attended some acting classes in the city but nothing much ever came of it. Since then whenever I brought up my desire to pursue an acting or even singing career they told me that it was ridiculous as I don't have the personality to be an actor or a singer in their eyes because of how I'm very introverted and thus should stick to something more practical. But yet even today I still have desires for an acting career as I spend hours watching films and copying facial expressions of famous actors in order to improve my acting ability. I also spend hours vividly daydreaming about what my life maybe like as an actor. I think about the films that I would star in, the plot and title of each film, the A-list actors that would be in the films, and how successful each of my films would be at the box office and with critics. I know it sounds insane talking about it but I'd also spent time daydreaming about winning an Oscar and what exactly I would say when I'd win and which A-list actors would be present to hear my acceptance speech. \n\nI also daydreamed about being apart of a vocal group that I called \"Ultra 5.\" The group would have eight members including myself (four guys and four girls) and we would all live in a two hundred million dollar Bel-Air estate that I had once seen on Zillow. I imagined how I would be filming a movie during the day and then writing music with my fellow \"Ultra 5\" members at night. I imagined that I had the most amount of instagram and twitter followers than anyone in the world by a milestone. I also imagined how I would portray the character of Spiderman in a Spiderman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Then I imagined that while portraying Spiderman I will also play Batman in a film series directed by Aaron Sorkin. I imagined myself being swarmed by fans on a daily basis more than even Michael Jackson. I also imagined how all the members of \"Ultra 5\" will be super famous as well as they will also have the highest instagram and twitter followings right behind me. Also each member of \"Ultra 5\" will dominate in a specific area within the entertainment industry for me that is acting for the other \"Ultra 5\" members that maybe modeling, literary publishing, or directing. I also imagine how out of the four girls of \"Ultra 5\" I would date the most popular and beautiful one who would be  a brunette and everyone would see us as a bigger power couple than Brangelina. I'd look at brunette girls my own age on Instagram and imagine that they would be the \"Ultra 5\" member that I would date. Also the second most beautiful \"Ultra 5\" member would be a blonde who would be best friends with the brunette \"Ultra 5\" member and both of them would have major crushes on me and I would have to decide which one I'd want to date. \n\nI'm sorry if that last paragraph was a lot to read but I really wanted you all to understand what is going on in my head for the last few years especially. Another thing that has bothered me for a while especially since I've joined high school was whether or not I was good looking. I always wanted to be an extremely attractive person as I wanted people to admire my looks the way they do for Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt. I constantly asked my family if they thought I was handsome as I was too afraid to ask any of my friends in fear that they would think I was weird or anyone else for that matter. They would always tell me that I am but I always felt like there was a problem as despite even me thinking that I'm handsome, I never got any attention from girls my own age. Now this could be because I barely interact with girls in my school and when I do it is only for school related matters but I always thought even then that at least a few girls would show some interest in me but nothing of the sort ever happened. Furthermore, it is not like the girls in my school don't have crushes on guys as I've heard them speak about their guy crushes in the past and personally I was shocked as I genuinely believe that I'm way better looking than the guys that they were crushing on. I mean it's not like I have a serious crush on any girl in my school in fact I find most of them to be unattractive with the exception of a handful of girls in my grade. \n\nAlso in recent years I've grown to have a strong love for teen dramas. Particularly since the beginning of high school I've watched teen dramas such as Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The Secret Life of The American Teenager, Riverdale, The OC, Beverly Hills 90210, The Vampire Diaries, Freaks &amp; Geeks, and Euphoria. When I'd watch each one of these shows not only did I obsess over the shows but also the cast as I learned so much about each and every one of their professional and personal lives. I would ship characters from the show and be extremely disappointed if they didn't end up together despite me knowing that at the end of the day it doesn't really matter because these characters don't exist in reality. Also being a guy watching teen dramas made me insecure as no other guy my age that I know of spent this much time on teen dramas as they would be more prompted to watch sports or some other show. Don't get me wrong I do watch other shows as I'm a fan of Cobra Kai which while it does have some teen drama in it, it is more of a karate soap opera than a straight up teen drama. Likewise, I also enjoy watching shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy as I've always found them hilarious. \n\nYet, when watching teen dramas I think what appeals to me the most about them is the fact that they are so different from my life as a high school student. As a current senior in high school I've never taken in any drugs or alcohol my whole life. Due to this at times I catch myself judging people in my school who have taken drugs or alcohol as I believe that I have more will power than them and that I must have a better home life that doesn't make me go towards alcohol and drugs. I also constantly search up celebs using drugs as I realize that similar to classmates I shame them to as I can't understand why anyone would do drugs in the first place. Furthermore, one of the things that disappoints me the most in my life is that I've never had a girlfriend, got laid, or even properly kissed. There was a time when I was eight years old that a girl and I shared a kiss for a second but that is the extent of my sexual experiences. I know that this isn't a big deal as plenty of guys my age have yet to have their first proper kiss as well but I still feel like I missed out on that experience that I should have had when I was young. \n\nI told my parents that I wanted to major in business and I'm interested in the business side of the entertainment industry. Additionally, I also said that I could possibly major in Economics and maybe work in an investment banking firm one day. To be honest, the only reason that I would ever want to work in an investment banking firm is so that I could have a lot of money and hopefully retire young and never have to work again. Despite, what I said earlier my parents do want me to pursue my interests as long as it is reasonable. My dad in particular has noticed these past few years that I never really ask for stuff and he always tells me how he is worried about how I'm going to manage in the real world as he thinks I'm too introverted. I believe that while I am indeed introverted I still talk to people and while I don't necessarily go out of my way to make conversation most of the time I still talk confidently when spoken to by an adult or someone my own age. I think my biggest fear is living a life filled with regret. I have been having all these thoughts and emotions for a while now and I really needed a place to vent it all out. \n\nFinally, I want to end off talking about some of my physical tics. My family has noticed over the past year that when I listen to a song I really like I would get out of my chair and stand while clapping my hands with my arms fully extended at the front and back of my body while swaying back and forth. Also, when I get any test back in school my hands start to get pins and needles as I await for the test results. I've noticed that especially this year I've become increasingly disillusioned with school as every day that I'm in school I'm just waiting to get out of school and go home so that I could sit at my desk in my room and watch animated stories or videos by my favorite youtubers. Don't get me wrong I still complete all my homework and study for tests it's just that while I'm doing that I also am also on Youtube watching different videos for hours on end and thus homework that could have taken half an hour now takes two hours. I also stay awake till midnight on weekdays watching videos after I finished all my work as I don't want the day to get over and go to school again in the morning. My dad always asks me why I'm so introverted as he considers me to be the black sheep of the family opposed to him, my brother, and mother. Till date I don't know the true answer. I notice how a lot of the times in school something funny may happen and while the whole class is laughing I'm the only one having to fake the laughter feeling like an outcast. \n\nSo if you can please share with me your thoughts that would be greatly appreciated.", "neg": 0.065, "neu": 0.811, "pos": 0.124, "compound": 0.9997}, {"text": "He\u2019s been married to my mom for\u2026 almost 17yrs (he and my mom married when I was 5 months old, even though they had my brother by then, he was 5 1/2.) That\u2018s not to say their relationship is healthy though, there\u2019s no doubt at all that it\u2019s not. They both failed to raise their son (my brother) effectively to a point where my brother, an adult, is now in rehab, has not gone to college and can\u2019t rlly hold down a job. My dad, I feel, has a lot to do with that. I remember that my dad has always been kind of off and been verbally abusive toward my older brother. My brother was still well behaved for a while though up until he was in high school when he understandably started having issues. As recently as a few months ago, I remember my dad was arguing w my mom when my brother was home (my brother argued w both my parents a lot) abt how if my mom had let him beat my brother when my brother was little he wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this. I can\u2019t imagine saying something like that about my son who had been in a mental hospital two years or so before. He also seemed more concerned abt how it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d both times when the police came over bc my brother and I said we were considering ending our lives. He was still kind of fake abt it with me and said I could talk to him and all even though I actually really can\u2019t\u2026\n\nI remember actually when the police were called a 2nd time more recently he said he and my mom would take my phone away if it happened again (they\u2019re both very paranoid. They always talk abt gang stalking and lights being flashed they\u2019re both weird and likely mentally unwell it\u2019s why they\u2019ve been together for so long in my opinion) and he said at a separate point he\u2019d \u201cleave\u201d if it happened again \n\nHe complained abt my mom not working (she was a housewife and used to be p good at it.) He\u2019s been a security guard since I was born apparently or something like that, at the same place. He doesn\u2019t bring in enough money for us to rlly idk be okay without my mom working or at least he didn\u2019t (we\u2019re okay now I wear braces and we have a TV set) my mom quit her job due to the vaccine and we\u2019ve been okay but my mom\u2019s mental health has declined in the past few years that\u2019s quite clear to me. \n\nHe\u2019s arguably a negligent parent. I don\u2019t have much of a relationship w him even though he works, and My mom has admitted if she weren\u2019t around she doesn\u2019t know he\u2019d be cooking for us (my mom\u2019s not a good parent herself but she\u2019s still a better parent than he is, always has been.) He can be somewhat more understanding abt my perspective than my mom is and wasn\u2019t super private abt the fact that I was his favorite child. My mom said she could tell I was his favorite child \n\nHe\u2019s not the most intelligent? He has nice handwriting but you can tell when he talks that he\u2019s not that smart or like he understands things but is kind of off and not that smart \n\nHe\u2019s kind of boring he smokes weed w my mom sometimes idk. He\u2019s rlly not a good father I have questioned his decision to even have kids w my mom multiple times. My mom j seems happy that he stayed around at all. I feel like I don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d him\n\nHe also drinks a lot but he doesn\u2019t run around beating us or anything he\u2019ll j maybe talk some shit or act dumb when he\u2019s been drinking. I\u2019d say he\u2019s an alcoholic but I can\u2019t help my parents w all their problems the way he and my mom are does play into my depression though. He\u2019s not a good make role model \n\nMy mom once mentioned he didn\u2019t \u201cwork for a year\u201d after his dad died but didn\u2019t cry at his funeral (my grandpa used to beat him.) He\u2019s a lot weirder than his family members but I actually rlly don\u2019t know why?? My aunts and uncles seem more \u201cnormal\u201d compared to him idk but it\u2019s not like they seem to have noticed anything. The extended family isn\u2019t 100% normal either. I don\u2019t see how he\u2019s surprised that his son turned out the way he did. Honestly if a guy like my dad can get married I think anyone can\n\nHe stayed w my mom even tho my mom mentioned she used to have trouble holding down guys or smthn even though she\u2019s conventionally attractive (she looks way better than my dad) bc she was \u201ccrazy.\u201d Said she was always throwing things and trying to fight ppl she seems to think my dad is a good guy bc he never beat her.

I put in bold some words and sentences just to emphasise them. So you can kind of read what I wrote faster.\n\nAnd, just to be clear I do not want to stop these (sometimes extreme) thoughts/points of view. That's how I've been for years now. I definitely dont wanna get molded as society desires it, I absolutely do not feel being a part of it and, I'm just myself, better off alone, and this is it.\n\n\\--\n\nCut to the point.\n\nSimply speaking, **in my opinion we should get purged from this planet**. And I honestly mean it, no matter how drastic this point of view is. I think like so because **we are** all going to be at some point **a nuisance** to someone or something. Whether it affects people for a only few minutes or their entire lifetime, and whatever the reason or our age, it will happen. Wether we angered someone, made them cry, or horrified them, or anything else. **It's unevitable.**\n\nBesides that, most if not all the time, people will not care about any consequences of their actions unless they are directly impacted by it.  What if someone did something really bad ? We barely know why, and  we have no idea how to seriously help them  ? Punish them. \u00a8Put them in mental institutions. Put them in jails. Let them understand their wrongdoings by themselves if they can. Give them the death penalty if they killed others. \"An eye for an eye\", that's what they say. **Pure selfishness.**\n\nIn my opinion, we are able to live in society only because of rules that have to be set. These rules aren't made to be broken, but they often have issues. And because they're never fixed, harmony cannot exist. **Only anarchy**. And I believe it won't disappear unless all of us are united, which wiill probably never happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many other things I could talk about, but it is completely pointless so I'm not going to do it. **I do not plan making things change IRL right now**.

I am not trying to invent myself a personality trough words, nor it is a way of thinking you could temporarily have after watching a movie you felt immersed into. **I'm being as honest as I can**, I've always had a similar way of thinking where **I'm quite simply fed up of everything.** And that feeling is definitely worsening over years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it isn't how I should think. But as I said I do not want to think differently because I wont recognise myself anymore. Whatever that must happen will happen, and that will not change. **I'm just trying to understand why exactly do I think like that.**\n\nIs it because I've always lived away from society ? Because i've always been alone since my childhood, because I've always felt uncomfortable talking and listening to people, is it another reason ? Because I've been depressive for nearly 10 years, because I had suicidal thoughts for a long while, because I tried to kill myself once ?  Is it because I've always forced myself to be as void of emotions as I can ? Or is it because I forced myself to always be pessimist, in order not to feel down if something isn't up to my expectations ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe a bit of all that, actually. **Maybe it's simply due to my past life, and how I decided to react to it.** But I just wanna know why is it ME that is like that, and not a random person in the world.

I feel like humanity is a disease, as we are all selfish and a nuisance to others at some point (if not our whole lifetime). I'm fed up of everything that happens on this planet, I'm also quite lost as I am yet to find a valid reason to not stay at bed all day long, and I'm seriously thinking that I might wanna show my point of view in a violent way (EG:Taking people with me) when I give up on living.\n\nTo be very clear, this is not what I want right now and I hope it will not be the case at some point.

I stared my sister in the eyes for over 10 seconds today I\u2019m pretty sure that counts as not having trouble with eye contact. I look off usually but idk why I do I focus better that way but I can make eye contact normally I think. I do stims but I think that is just fidgeting and not stimming that I\u2019m doing actually. I say I don\u2019t like physical contact but my friend held pinkies with me and it didn\u2019t bother me and my relative was in the car with me and was pressed against me physically because it was cramped and I wasn\u2019t freaking out like I should have totally been doing. I think I fake it so I can act like I\u2019m a lone wolf or something stupid like that. I flinch at touch sometimes for stupid attention probably. I have a hard time talking to people like starting conversations but I can get loud and hold one about a few topics and approach teachers in school just fine. I don\u2019t think that means I have a social disorder, right? I\u2019m probably lying about thinking of having it for fun so I can join other people.\n\nOther things - I self harm a lot like I slam my head when something isn\u2019t perfect or right in my mind or when I make someone upset in a conversation. I scratch myself or bruise myself for the same thing. A few times I tried cutting with a knife in my kitchen. And then I didn\u2019t keep doing it because I got scared because I don\u2019t \u201creally\u201d self harm in a hurting way. Another attention thing. I think a lot about how the people around me are better off without me or would leave me in a heartbeat and I idealize committing suicide but I think that\u2019s just me romanticizing the idea of it so people can give me attention. But I also don\u2019t like thinking about the people I love coming into the bathroom or something and seeing me dead. idk it\u2019s sick and twisted how I use other people\u2019s real struggles for a crumb of attention by faking it. I never had isolation problems I just chose to not talk to the people around me and act like I have issues.

The months after weren\u2019t easy with some other bad stuff happening to my family (car accidents etc), but the worse happened in June.\n\nMy dog (who was 6 years old at the time, I was 18) turned sick. At first we thought it was a cold, but I had a feeling something really wrong was happening and that she was dying.\nThe local vet wasn\u2019t impressed and labs came back fine. Within a week it got to the point where she couldn\u2019t breath. One night was hard in particular and we thought she might not survive it. \nThe morning after my parents took her to a veterinarian hospital and they found out she had a huge mass compressing her entire chest. \nBeing at the hospital my parents called me crying, they said the vets have to do a procedure that might kill her on the spot. I cried until they returned from the hospital with her. My family and I were devastated, we couldn\u2019t understand how this is happening to us for the second time in 2 months. \nThe same night (at midnight) the pathologist called saying she has a lymphoma. Few days after we started chemotherapy and we were told she would survive for 9-12 months depending on the aggressiveness. \nTwo weeks after we found out she has the aggressive type.\n\nFrom here it was a short road to hell. Weekly chemotherapies, one time she is better, the week after acute blast crisis.\nI looked for every alternative therapy and got it to her, couldn\u2019t lose her so soon.\n\nWithin two months she got worse, and one day she collapsed near me when she tried to stand still. I panicked and we rushed her to the hospital. \nAt the hospital the doctor was talking about getting her a euthanasia. My brother and I begged crying for my parents not to do it yet.\nShe got a blood transfusion and was released back home. \nIt was 2 days before my 19th birthday  \nso I managed to convince my parents to wait with the euthanasia. At that time my parents accused me and her brother for being selfish, for letting her suffering.\n\nNo need to mention it was the saddest birthday in my life seeing that my dog, who meant the whole world to me, collapses every time she tries to stand.\n\nThe night after my birthday my parents found her laying the other side our yard. we couldn\u2019t understand how she got there considering she couldn\u2019t walk. We took her back inside understanding she might die that night. \nApparently her running away happened one more time during that night.\nIn the morning I woke up to the sounds of my mom screaming. My dog managed to escape again and this time got under some trees. She laid still with flies all around her. She wasn\u2019t dead but her tongue and ears were completely white, it was scary to look at. \nWe cried and begged her to get out, she must have laid there for two more hours until we managed to.

I was bullied at  such an extent that I was looking with fear to the next time I will meet  my abusers, which was almost all the time as we frequented similar  spots and my home town was small. At the same time, being the dumb kid  that I was, I also made some mistakes and got to be from outspoken  straight up rude, insulting people that I could call my then-friends to a  grave extent.\n\nMy own punishment  that I brought on my self was refusing to make fun of people and talk  behind their backs ever again. You might wonder, \"punishment\"? Allow me  to explain myself - making fun of people for no apparent reason is  inherently bad but at the same time, I was using this to establish  boundaries in a way that is not overly dramatic. And of course, talking  behind people's back is shit behaviour, but being the dedicated kid that  I was if I will do something it will be all or nothing so that meant  not venting at all - keeping it all in, not getting any advice from my  peers regarding a behaviour from someone else upon myself, a nuance,  nothing, nothing - which is one of the many fruits that communication  bears.\n\nAnother punishment that I  deemed fit was my abusive relationship through which I went - that meant  an insane amount of verbal abuse, gaslighting etc. won't get into  details, everything in the cookbook. In the beginning, I was quite the  warrior and I put up a good fight but this person seemed to be able to  erode my personality bit by bit. By the end of it, my own self was  diluted at such an extent that I cannot bear to fathom.\n\nI  do not remember some things in the present either as I shut down,  though I am fine nowadays, its been over 5 years and I moved on. But it  was not easy - in the first 2-3 it was fairly difficult to reintegrate  in society - being labeled as aggressive, passive agressive or  antisocial. While trying out different integration tactics, at my first  office job ( which looking back, was kind of toxic as well ) I was used  by my colleagues for different favours such as venting or cigarettes,  felt looked down upon simply through the dismissive looks my colleagues  were throwing each other ( which they did not seem to hide after one  point in time ), I had no self respect or self confidence in the work  that I was delivering ( even though, I was doing actually a pretty good  job ).\n\nMy relationship with my  parents was never good in teenage hood. I always had my mother downplay  on me standing up for myself. I communicated to her that I do not like  it, approximately a year ago and that was the start of bettering our  relationship, however it had a long way to go, with her continously  trying to put situational conflicts on me being the culprit e.g. I would  come to tell her a story with me and person X, in which person X was  completely rude, moment in which her first reaction would be, did X see  you have some \"aggressive\" ( in lack of better words ) facial  expressions? Probably it might not be a clear example for some of you,  but what I mean is: her approach is instead of pushing your own goddamn  child to stand up for oneself you hope your child was not reactive to an  obvious insult - which you should be.\n\nNow,  needless to say I am in a situation where I cannot f\\*cking deal with  confrontation, out of fear of being too agressive, dramatic, out of  touch with reality etc.That varies by nuances, maybe a jokingly said  f\\*ck you without an established ground to aggressiveness, passive  agressiveness, crossing my own boundaries etc. My humour used to save me  with putting people in their place though I haven't practiced it in a  long time because of that stupid \"punishment\" I brought on myself,  failing to realize it was a gift rather than a curse and when having a  strong personality, of course you're going to turn some heads. I feel  like throughout my life, over and over again, other people have built  their self esteem on my back and I was aware of it, letting it happen. I  feel like I have to cut sharp like a razor blade when people start  slowly crossing boundaries because it is easier sooner rather than  later. That is out of fear of getting in the situation previously  mentioned - because others had no limits of being a\\*sholes whatsoever.  At the same time, that is a mismatch with my easy-going, fun,  joking-type of person.\n\nTLDR: So, how do you deal with confrontation? do you have examples or \"phrases\" you use?", "neg": 0.162, "neu": 0.749, "pos": 0.089, "compound": -0.9979}, {"text": "Hi Everyone, I am currently training for a Certificate in Life Coaching.

I know that sounds stupid or weird but looking up myself I didn\u2019t find many answers.", "neg": 0.121, "neu": 0.788, "pos": 0.092, "compound": -0.6137}, {"text": "This is a long story, so I\u2019m sorry in advance. I hope your day is going really well so far &lt;3 (and if it is, you might want to click away, this post is kind of a bummer haha!)\nI don\u2019t know if it matters at all that I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression and multiple anxiety disorders in the past, but I\u2019ll put it out there just in case it can give any extra input or even an explanation to whatever this weird phase is that I\u2019m going through.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve always been very insecure about the way that I look. Last year, there was a period of time where it was bad enough that I started to count my calories very strictly. At first I allowed myself 800 a day, then it felt like too much, so I went down to 500 a day, then I felt guilty about those 500 as well, so I just stopped eating all together.\nI had managed to eventually push myself out of that bad place, and started eating again. The main reason was that I stopped caring about weight, and adopted the mindset of \u201cwell, eventually we all die anyway, and it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d (an important detail for the present-day-issues). It felt unnecessary to suffer, so I started to eat again.\nA few months on I was almost completely back to normal, and would eat without even thinking about it. It\u2019s been almost a year I think? Probably less.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I spiraled back into it. This time it\u2019s worse. At first I allowed myself 500 a day, then quickly found I feel extremely guilty for the little I do let myself eat, and stopped eating again. Whenever I do eat, whether it\u2019s because my family starts to suspect or because I give in to the hunger, I feel like I have to make up for it by not eating a thing the next couple of days.\n\nI think the problem is that it\u2019s not just about weight. I\u2019ve been caring less and less about my weight the past few days, and the same thoughts of \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run\u201d have been back, but I still want to starve. Some days I\u2019m kind of okay with my current weight, but despite that, the thought of eating terrifies me and if I do eat I feel extremely guilty afterwards. I find myself less anxious when my stomach feels empty or when I exercise on an empty stomach. \n\n I\u2019m afraid that I just want to starve. Despite knowing that in the long run, starvation is actually counterproductive for weight loss, I keep looking for excuses to do it anyway. I\u2019ve been searching through so many articles for one to tell me that the body\u2019s \u201csurvival mode\u201d doesn\u2019t exist and that I actually will lose weight starving. I feel like even if somehow my body magically started losing weight the more I eat, I\u2019d still want to starve. It\u2019s like some days it really is about losing weight, and others I just want to know that I haven\u2019t eaten today.\n\nThe thing that bothers me the most is that I really don\u2019t want to get better. I don\u2019t want to find a reason to stop feeling this way or to eat normally.\n\nI\u2019m really scared of people finding out. Enough to even bring up food myself, like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to eat when I get home\u201d or \u201cwow I ate so much today, I feel awesome\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve been hiding it from my friends and family partly because I\u2019m really embarrassed about it, but mostly because I don\u2019t want to burden them. I\u2019ve been avoiding my friend group because we often snack together, and I find it ten times harder to resist food when I\u2019m with them. I hate saying \u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d because I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll catch on, so when I\u2019m with them I always end up eating and then beating myself up for it afterwards.\nI\u2019m the therapist/mum friend in the group, and I guess they\u2019re used to seeing me as someone they turn to with their own mental struggles, so I kind of have this \u201cpersona\u201d of the friend who has her life put together and always looks on the bright side and always knows what to say and always has the answer to everything and always has a bandaid at the ready and anything they need. I hate looking vulnerable in front of them. They probably wouldn\u2019t have believed it if someone told them of the mental illnesses I\u2019ve been dealing with for years.\n\nWhich leads me to the next point - I *don\u2019t* think I have an eating disorder. Last year when I was going through a similar thing, it stopped on its own in just a few months without ever having to tell my parents. I think I\u2019ve just been going through a really weird phase. I\u2019m just bothered by how terrified I am of the thought of getting out of it. It\u2019s really hard to explain, but it makes me feel this weird type of imposter syndrome, like I\u2019m trying to suffer just so I can feel bad for myself, because since weight isn\u2019t as scary to me as it used to be, why do I still starve? Do I subconsciously think it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d or something? Don\u2019t people who suffer from stuff like that, want to get better? If I don\u2019t, does that mean I\u2019m faking it so I can feel bad for myself? Yeah, it\u2019s a really ugly feeling.\n\nWelp, thank God for strangers on the internet.\n\nThank you so much if you read this thing, there was literally no one holding a gun to your head but you did it anyway, haha. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking for an answer, as again - I don\u2019t really want to get better. I think I just wanted to vent. It\u2019s been a little heavy.\n\nI hope you have a really, truly good day. &lt;3\n\np.s - not sure how to flair this because it started with me looking for an opinion and spiraled into a massive vent. sorry, haha.", "neg": 0.175, "neu": 0.72, "pos": 0.105, "compound": -0.9986}, {"text": "It was fucking traumatizing.

Years of being called names and talked down to eventually caught up with me. He put bruises on me and had hit me 3 times. He broke countless things that were meaningful to me out of anger. Furthermore, I had found a text message from his college \"friend\" who he had written, \"Hey, next time I'm over maybe we can take a dip in your hotub after we study.\" Needless to say, we have been divorced for a few years. \n\nWhen I left I didn't have children and I had a mother who allowed me to move back in with her. I had just started my BA degree in psychology to pursue my MA in Counseling (MFT/PCC). When I left people would say \"Omg I'm so sorry.\" My response was always the same, \"No it's okay, I feel liberated like I can breathe again\".  I also had a loving sister who reached deep into that abyss to pull me out and encourage me to get help. It took many times of feeling helpless, uncontrollable crying, shaking in fear, unstoppable worry, and belief in myself to move on. \n\nWhat we had was undeniably the most incredible love I had ever felt.

He questioned everything he was raised on and the holy spirit. Once he stopped attending church for a while, I asked if he'd like to attend somewhere else. We did go to a larger church for a while, but he didn't connect the way he should have with the men in the church. He continued to carry the weight of his issues on his own shoulders, instead of on God. He blamed the pastors of multiple churches for being controlling and manipulative, which in fact was his detriment. \n\nLet's catch up to 2022. Tell me it isn't a coincidence that he has now married a new woman. This is his third marriage. I found out yesterday that he and his wife are talking about splitting up. He's not happy. No fu#@in surprise to me! I knew he would never be happy with another person, he's not happy with himself. He complains that she is not as affectionate as he'd like. \n\nI have been dating a guy for three years, who will never marry me. Really I just believe that he's not meant to marry. We are breaking up soon. We have talked about it multiple times. I am just waiting for the right time. He will move out and I will have my own apartment for the first time in my life at the age of 35. I graduate in 7 weeks with my Master's in Marriage Family Therapy and Professional Clinical Counseling. I lead an amazing worship group and I have amazing supports and individuals in my life who bring happiness and joy to me daily. \n\nI had an encounter yesterday with the most amazing guy. He had the most beautiful spirit of love. I could see it in his eyes and could feel it as he walked me to my car. He loved people just like me. God told me that someone like him was waiting for me. He was preparing my husband who will love me in all my flaws and insecurities. In fact, he will see the beauty in them. It will be a Godly man who has the same spirit of serving people.

Thinking that every person you met had access to your deepest secrets... your private thoughts. Like your skull had cracked open and that there was nothing you could do to stop the thoughts from pouring out.\n\nThat's exactly where I found myself in 2008, aged 22. \n\nI had dreams, hopes, and goals and they had all been shattered by five words: \"We think... you have schizophrenia\".\n\n\"Damn,\" I thought to myself, I'm not even sure I understood what that meant. I'd heard about those people on TV. Weren't they the murderous ones? the criminal ones? those without any future? What did that have to do with me?\n\nFast forward to today I'm a happily married mother of one, living in the North of England. A proud cosmopolitan woman who's been to hell and back. I'm here to say that you too can make it to the other side.  I've found my balance through trial and error and I believe that some people might benefit from my experience.\n\nIt won't be easy, you'll have to face a lot of adversity, there will be friends and family members you'll have to let go of. You'll have to confront the monsters of your past and slay them. They will still be there taunting you many years later - but you'll have grown to see them as shadows, distant traces in your memory that no longer have power over you.\n\nThe first step is the hardest. You have to accept that there's a problem. You wouldn't be where you are if there wasn't one. You're not there by chance. I don't think there's a magic formula for acceptance, a one-size-fits-all solution. What worked for me won't necessarily work for you. What I found helpful in my case was asking questions. There were many negative thoughts going against me, leading me to believe there had been a mistake, but I had to rely on hard facts. Questions like; Why am I here? What is this place? How do people end up here? Who treats people here? Can you end up here by mistake? If so how do I get out? How do they let people out? All these questions led me to think at first that something was obviously wrong but not so wrong that the whole world had gone mad. That was a fact, then if I'd been sectioned by mistake, I needed to prove it to my \"gatekeepers\".  Needless to say, I didn't succeed. It would take about 3 years for me to realize that I had indeed gone \"mad\".\n\nThose 3 years would be hell for my mother and my stepfather whose mission was to keep me alive at all costs. There would be sane times with welcome breaks for them where there was some semblance of normality. These peaceful moments were achieved through medication and weekly visits to my psychiatrist. Medication that had to be injected intravenously, until I agreed to take oral medication in exchange for my freedom. The constant surveillance only emphasized my symptoms but I was too \"gone\" to realize it. \n\nIn my case, medication has been generally effective and beneficial. However, I must say that I've had to pay a price for that. I went from 60kgs to over 100kgs in about 2-3 years after becoming a fully compliant patient in 2011. Some might say that's not so bad, but the consequences to my self-esteem, mental health, and health in general, have been severe. The doses and brands of meds I've taken have changed more than I care to remember. Today, a small dose of antipsychotic and 1 or 2 anti-depressants keep me stable. \n\nLiving day to day is also important. When you are fighting a health crisis like this, the most care should be given to how you spend your days. There really isn't space for anything else, it's all about surviving each day and making it to the next. This might seem sad but simplifying your existence will help you to spend less time in your head. The less time you spend in your head the better. This emphasis on daily living can be called mindfulness, minimalism, or simple living. I'm really grateful for that time because it helped me to see what mattered the most in life. Things like friends, family and helping others. I realized that I had been spending my life on unproductive things that led nowhere. I started to read again, and bought second-hand books on spirituality, self-help and health. This gave me space between what I was going through and my daily life. I got a full-time job that didn't require me to think, paid off my debts and started to feel at peace.\n\nThat peace slowly progressed into acceptance, from there to contentment and finally to hope. Progress had been made.\n\nAnother thing that has been really helpful is therapy. I didn't get access to psychotherapy until I was well into my mental health recovery. The second psychiatrist (I've also had a bunch of them), that treated me for about 3 years believed that I would really benefit from one. The first therapist I saw was very good but she didn't have many availabilities. The second therapist I consulted was paid for by the government and was too young. She must have been a bit older than I was at the time (I'd say early thirties) and always asked me the same questions. In the same monotone voice. And just didn't seem to care that much. I skipped so many sessions with her that they took me off her list. \n\nYears later, having moved in with my would-be husband and benefiting from his private insurance, I found a therapist online that would help me to see my blind spots, give me a better understanding of my past, and challenge me to see things that I had overlooked. The psychiatrist was right, therapy was really key. I could only afford 8 sessions, but those sessions were pivotal. They didn't revolutionize my life, they even made me feel a bit low afterwards. Indeed, I had to confront traumatic events from my childhood. That affected the way I perceived the world and interacted within it. It gave me a greater understanding of myself; love, and compassion for the child I'd been; and respect, admiration and pride for myself for making it through all this. \n\nWith everything that happened, something that really kept me going was the conviction that I hadn't gone through all that for nothing. I still had ambition but I had to break down my goals to make them more realistic and achievable. It took consistent and daily steps to get here. I still have bad days and times when I just need to be left alone, dark times when I ruminate all day long - but I'm still here.\n\n**Tips and Reminders for your epic journey**\n\nIt might take you more time or you may get through it faster than I did. Everyone's journey is different, remember to be kind to yourself. Go at your own pace.\n\nIf you don't believe you can make it, read and learn from others. Your situation may be unique to you, but there are millions of us that have been through the same thing.\n\nThere will be setbacks, be prepared for a journey that will not be smooth sailing. You will be challenged but you can make it.\n\nDo not believe in miracle solutions that claim that you can be cured. It doesn't work that way. Do not believe it!\n\nRecovery isn't life as it was. Recovery is a new way of living, thinking, and being.\n\nAsk for help when in doubt, when you're feeling down, or when you think there's no way out. Be willing to be vulnerable, most of the time it will be welcomed. People will listen to you, even share their experiences with you.\n\n**Take-aways**\n\nOn this journey self-compassion is a requirement, there will be many ups and downs. Times when you want to quit, give up, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nThere isn't a miracle solution, this is what worked for me. I hope you'll find what works for you or your loved one and that my post helps.

One of the key ideas in the book is the idea that what mystics, poets, saints and artists and others with vision have access to is not the supernatural, but union with reality. They see the interconnected and miraculous in the everyday and they attempt through writing and art to make that available to us. \n\nThe obvious question that begs then, if these people with vision are in touch with real, unfiltered reality, what is it then that we\u2019re experiencing? Its a bit of a scary thought but its obvious when you break it down. \n\nWe all have model in our head for how the world works. This model simplifies and distorts reality; it emphasises some things and deprioritises others. Its full of constructions and labels and judgements and assumptions that come from a lifetime of experience, our culture, our technology, our ideas. What you\u2019re experiencing isn\u2019t true reality - its what your mind shows you of the real world.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good reason why our mind sits in the way and presents us with it\u2019s filtered version of reality. It comes back to the purpose of the mind, which is to keep you alive and safe. Your mind is a bit like a parent saying, \"watch out for this, don\u2019t forget about that,\" constantly worrying about us and making us worry in the process. In the same way that we don\u2019t need to have our parents around us our entire lives, we can also get our mind to stand down, take a chill pill and relax. But like your mum, it needs some convincing to let go.\n\nThe first step is realise, accept and look deeply into the model of reality that your mind is putting in front of you. This version has hugely emphasised the dangers, risks and potential catastrophes that could befall you and ignores the beauty of the world most of the time. Evelyn Underhill described it as being inside a house with dirty windows but believing that you\u2019re outside. See the model your mind has created, smile to the model. Smile to your mind. Your mind is still your friend.\n\nAnother critical step is to build your daily meditation practice. The only way to touch reality is to glue your awareness back together again and you can\u2019t do this without a strong practice. Set your regular time each day for practice and stick to it, even if you don\u2019t feel like doing it. If you can\u2019t do twenty mins, do ten minutes. If you can\u2019t do any formal practice, work it into your day. Do some walking meditation from your house to your car.\n\nIts also really important to make fundamental changes to simplify your life to give you the space and time to touch reality. If your job has you working all hours and stressed out, it might be time for a career change - nothing is more important than your wellbeing and peace. Even if a job pays well, even if you\u2019re in a position of respect and power - what's the point if it costs your mental health. Future happiness doesn\u2019t exist, you can only be happy in the present moment. Let go of working towards a future, simplify your current life so you can enjoy being alive now.\n\nAnd finally, a practice that is critical for getting in touch with reality is spending time around nature. That's why we have pets and houseplants, they\u2019re so good for our mental health. But you can also go out and spend time in nature, spend hours just breathing and noticing things - the shape of clouds, the colour of leaves, the texture of bark, the iridescent wings of a magpie. Stop and see how much you can notice every time you\u2019re in nature of any kind. It will reduce your stress and help ground you in the here and now.\n\nYour mind is like a limpet, completely attached to the reality it has created which you\u2019ve lived in your whole life, so don\u2019t rush the process, give yourself time to expand your awareness. But by seeing this construction for what it is you can start the journey of releasing it and living \u201cempty\u201d as TNH describes - devoid of any assumptions, labels or attachments.\n\n[Listen for more](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-to-live-in-the-present-moment/id1493806566?i=1000554561228)", "neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.803, "pos": 0.137, "compound": 0.9969}, {"text": "I am writing this in a moment of mental clarity, I am a 19-year-old young man and I have relatively strong mental health compared to the average person of my age.

However, instead of sitting and watching porn and fapping all day, I decided to have some activities in order to distract me such as going to the gym, after school activities, and expanding my social circle.

I just wanted him on my sides, looking after me sometimes, sharing the burden, at least emotionally. But no. he left, and accused me of many things to feel 'better' about him leaving: my lack of libido (with a fucking endometriosis, yeah, sorry!!), my lack of attention towards his problems 'cause I always had so many' (namely, my family, disabled brother and toxic parents). He, on the other side, comes from a wealthy and kind family, where his parents would DIE for him.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m permanently awkward, socially inept, rigid, and overwhelmed. I\u2019m female, college age, and have always been like this for every single symptom. I received sporadic therapy/interventions as a child/teenager but nothing has really stuck or helped me. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with plenty of things: BPD, bipolar 2, OCD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, at one point just \u201cgeneral personality disorder\u201d. \n\nNow that I\u2019m an adult I can\u2019t afford to just hop around therapists who aren\u2019t giving me the treatment I need. No therapy or medications have ever helped with my symptoms.\n\nThis is going to be super long because I\u2019m not really sure how to concisely describe my \u201csymptoms\u201d. But I\u2019m honestly really struggling to function with work/school/adulthood and I\u2019m looking for any type of advice on how to proceed. \n\n**Depression?:** Previous professionals said these were depression symptoms. I can't tell when I'm hungry until I'm literally going to pass out. I would rather go without eating if I don't have my favorite foods. I can't tell when something is wrong with my body, like getting sick or, once, an organ infection I didn't even feel until I was almost septic. I will stay awake until I pass out standing sometimes. I just can't introspect about how I physically feel until I'm basically nonfunctional. I'm not sad so I don't think it's depression? I feel like I'm piloting a character that I can see but can't feel. \n\n**Social issues:** Basically, I have a lot of social difficulties understanding others intentions or \u201creading between the lines\u201d. I find it very hard to make friends or relate to other people because of it. I come off as unfriendly because I don\u2019t really make facial expressions if that makes sense? When I try to make expressions while talking to others or even make eye contact I feel like a very bad actor and I think it\u2019s even more off-putting. It\u2019s not really just\u2026awkwardness but I don\u2019t know how else to describe it? One previous psychiatrist said I lack emotions/empathy but that\u2019s really not true. I feel a lot and I care about other people. \n\n**Anxiety:** I have constant racing anxiety in public. I constantly think about if I\u2019m standing too still, or moving too much, or if \u201cnormal people\u201d are acting the way I\u2019m acting. I try to copy what other people are doing but I still seem to stick out. It makes my public anxiety so much worse. I\u2019m really irritable/snap constantly to anyone who goes grocery shopping with me because it\u2019s just such an awfully anxious, loud, overwhelming experience for me. I get the sense that it\u2019s not like this for other people and they just run errands peacefully?\n\n**OCDish? Behaviors**: I think OCD is probably the only accurate diagnosis I\u2019ve received but I\u2019ll write out these symptoms too. I\u2019ve always been very rigid about routines and needing to do things in a certain order/way. Some examples are different kinds of food can\u2019t touch on my plate, microwave must be stopped at a certain time, etc. Plans CANNOT change suddenly or I\u2019m likely to cry/have a weird adult temper tantrum.\n\n**Adult temper tantrums:**  I have these weird...tantrums? Or that\u2019s the only way I can think to describe it. It especially happens when I have been working a lot or after running a lot of errands. I get really overwhelmed and frustrated and have no idea what to do next or how to soothe myself. I end up crying and hitting myself in the face/head to the point of bruising and swelling. I have never felt violent towards others and I\u2019m not angry when this happens so I don\u2019t think I have anger issues. This was diagnosed in the past as panic attacks but it feels nothing like my anxiety. Tantrum is really the only word for it. This is the worst thing for me and it takes days to fully recover.\n\n**Dumb smart person:** I\u2019m super dumb while also being smart? I get very good grades and read/write a lot. I like learning new things, reading nonfictions, etc. But I don\u2019t get very simple things sometimes. I understand jokes hours later, or don\u2019t realize someone is talking to me even if they\u2019re looking directly at me, or don\u2019t understand what someone is explaining to me verbally. It feels like when I\u2019m alone I\u2019m really intelligent but in interactions I feel like I literally have brain damage sometimes. I sometimes write out my \u201cspeaking lines\u201d in advance for interactions to prevent the Dumb Smart Person thing from happening. \n\n**Misc:** Some things people have said are odd about me. I only think in words, I literally cannot \u201cpicture\u201d anything. I sometimes struggle to speak, like I just can\u2019t get the words out. Sometimes I go mute for a while. I fidget a lot and distract others in school/work environments. I have a hard time concentrating if not doing several things at once (such as reading a book in class or listening to music at work). \n\nAnd that\u2019s about it, I think. I\u2019m so sorry for the wall of text. I\u2019m not looking for an internet diagnosis, I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has experienced similar symptoms and gotten treatment for it or if I really am just super awkward and this is normal?

I realize there are free and low-cost mental health services available, but the ones in my area do not offer a consistent counselor, so I don't think I can really work with deeper trauma that requires several sessions to confront.\n\nSo as a high school student, I was never overwhelmed by homework, classes, or friends. It was pretty easy-going for me. However, in the few times I felt stressed out, I would get angry and lash out a bit at my family, then stew in my anger for a bit longer, and use a little bit of willpower to start doing homework and I would be \"on a roll,\" so to speak. Because of my anger, I could finish my homework quickly and always be ahead of schedule for the week. These bursts of anger followed by productivity would usually happen once a month at most.\n\nMy current issue is, now that I am a university student and despite learning to control my anger better, the workload I have is a bit insane. A professor here is well-known for assigning 30+ hour homework assignments for a single class (and recommends the infamous 80 hour work week). I no longer lash out at people around me and I spend most of my time trying to finish my work. This wouldn't be an issue if I was losing motivation. I am still very enthusiastic about the topic I am studying but the assignments are so mundane and so draining every single week. At some point, I realized I was artificially finding ways to anger myself to provide the necessary fuel required for me to push through these assignments. After a semester and a half of doing so (approximately 6 months) I fully realize how unhealthy it is. I am so drained that I find it hard to get angry, but when I do, I can't sleep and I forget to eat for multiple days. But this anger wasn't like the old anger that I could use as fuel, this anger prevents me from doing work. I am barely keeping up with my assignments and I have made crucial decisions to rank my classes in levels of importance to my major and only focus on classes that I really need to graduate. In the other classes, I allow myself to miss some points on the assignments and occasionally skip them. What I want to know is if there is a way to turn myself around. Is there some other source of motivation I can tap into or some healthier regiment that I can follow for productivity? I am still very enthusiastic about the topic I am studying, it's just that the university forces all majors to take classes in other departments as well.\n\nTLDR; Used anger to boost productivity in high school. The anger boost still works in university, but the workload is too high so I try to create bursts of anger, which are tiring me out even more than the work.

A little back story about me, I have had depression for about 10 years now. My biggest issue I suffer with is crying at everything. My response is always to cry at anything stressful whether it's something big or small. I have tried everything under the sun to cope with it and the best thing I've found to do is to surround myself with positive and supportive people for my conditions. I am a very private person and I don't like to talk much about my depression/anxiety. I only talk to people I know who I'm safe to talk with. Along with my depression journey I decided to switch up jobs completely and do something I absolutely love to do, which is to work with dogs. I started working for a private business in the state of Georgia so I don't know much about private business rules and such. I started this job around October and started to do really well with myself. I would say the best I've done since I've been officially diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I started out as a dog bather and showed promise so I was told by the owner that she wanted to give me the opportunity to become a grooming intern. I felt extremely good because I was doing something I absolutely loved but with good things comes the bad. As soon as I was told this I was instantly doubted by the salon manager because of my anxiety/depression. She told everyone in the salon that I wouldn't make it. I kinda shrugged it off because I know not to listen to people that can't be supportive of me. As time past drama became a issue and anyone that works in a grooming salon knows there's nothing but drama. There were a few times that I got emotional (never because of the dogs) but because almost everyone around me would be constantly putting down someone. This started to take a toll on my mental health. I felt extremely unsupported and around nothing but negativity. One day the owner of the business pulled me in her office to talk. She was explaining to me how learning to grooming was hard and I better \"toughen up\" or I wouldn't make it. And of course my response was to cry because I don't like being cornered and not being able to stand up for myself. Later than day I was stoped and asked if she could purchase me natural remedies for my depression to try to help me \"cure\" it. She proceeded to tell me a story about how she \"cured\" a family members depression. I was definitely caught off guard and thought it was extremely unprofessional. I barely even know this person nor does this person know me or the struggles I've been though. Especially to be asked that when I consider myself to be doing the best I have been in a long time just didn't sit right with me. More time past and my job review came around. The owner pulled me in the office and basically told me the same thing except added about how half of people don't make it to groom because their emotions get in the way. At the end of the review I was told that my goal needs to be to get my depression under control and my medication correct. Again I thought that was a very unprofessional thing to say especially when it comes to talking about medications. Time passed and what started out as a week away from me interning to almost 2 months now and learning only learning two things about grooming. Rumors had started floating around about the owner talking to other co workers about my depression and how they were concerned about me.\n\nAt this job I have met a person I would consider to be one of my bestfriends for life. I would definitely say she has helped me learn more about at standing up for myself. For the last few days I have felt down because of petty drama happening at work and people being hateful towards me for no reason so I have kept my head down and followed my rule, go to work, head down, finish work, and go home. I am the type of person that believes work is work. Work isn't my life. My life it out of work so I do not consider co workers \"family\" like some do, they are just strangers I work with. Today I finally got the courage to ask the owner about my grooming internship because of the rumors I've been hearing. Before I could get anything out of my mouth I was asked what was wrong with me. My response was nothing I just needed to ask some questions and was told by the owner I need to cut the bullshit and tell her what's wrong because she knows something is wrong with me. I explained that I had some concerns by the end of convo I was crying because it's a stressful situation for me. After the conversation I went into a more private room so I could calm myself down and my friend followed right behind me to help me get through a hard situation. She is the only person I do feel comfortable with at work. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the owner telling me to come talk to her again and telling my friend to leave. I was sat down and asked what's wrong which ended in me not being about to get a word out because I was being compared to the now salon manager. A few other points I was told was 1. I needed to fix my medication and get help 2. I was too sensitive. 3. I needed to look in the mirror. 4. I wasn't the same person since I started (no longer had a big happy smile everyday) 5.there was concerns that I was going to break learning how to groom. During this she kept mentioning that she has been talking about my conditions to the salon manager and a coworker that isn't a manger but more like a owners pet. I was basically gaslighted the whole conversation. My biggest thing is that I don't bring my personal life into work. I go to work, I work, and I leave. Nobody knows my struggles and I don't care to share and I have made this very clear a few times to my owner but somehow it always comes back up. My concern now is everything I told her today because I was basically forced is going to be spread throughout the salon. Nothing is confidential here and it sucks because I don't want my information out there. The owner thinks she helped me with this conversation but really she just made me feel worse about myself. I do consider myself a very functional person with depression. I force myself to get up and work to keep myself distracted. I thought this job was my safe place where I could go do something I love but now I feel horrible about everything. I Have doubts and it's wanting to make me quit my goals and dreams of being a groomer. This is something I've set my soul in and to basically be told I'm broken today really hurt and made me go on a downward spiral. It really was the cracking point. I would try to find another job but where I live it's very hard to find someone to train in grooming. I believe the owner and the salon manager is definitely overstepping their boundaries but it's not like I can go to a HR person because they are hr. I'm just at a loss on what to do.
