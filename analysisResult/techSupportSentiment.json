For those who recognise the reference, yes it's quite old ! :D\n\nSymptoms : Not recognised by either the BIOS or Windows tools, makes no sound that I can hear. (Seems to be related: After I plugged it in for the first time in a while, I accidentally knocked my tower which bluescreened my PC. So mabye it's showing some signs of \"life\" ?)\n\nSo from what I could read, my best bet would be to swap the PCB. Do you agree ?\n\nI also read that I would have to swap the BIOS chip on that PCB. Is it 100% necessary ? Do I have to buy a heat gun for this or is there other methods ? (I only have a soldering iron atm)\n\nSecond case :\n\nAn external Maxtor M3 1TB (model: HX-M101TCB/GM)\n\nSymptoms : Not recognised by Windows Explorer but it shows in Devices and Printers ! \n\nWhen I open Disk Management, it prompts me to initialize the disk but either option fails because of a \"Fatal hardware error\". The command \"wmic diskdrive get status\" shows 2 lines of \"OK\" (one being my SSD I assume) I can't do any of the other recommanded solutions since I can't attribute a letter to the drive.

Right now it's laying flat on my table, taking up all the space and buried under cables. \n\nAfter many hocus-pocus stuff i tried finally taking the MoBo out of the case to rule out shorting. The MoBo on itself with just RAM sticks and CPU connected worked like a charm, got me into BIOS like it normally would, no sign of VGA at all. So i tried plugging first thing back in, the GPU. Understandably i thought it will be the culprit then, when iGPU worked and VGA LED was the problem. After connecting the GPU and powering it and everything, i plugged HDMI into it as well, and guess what, worked like a charm again. So i ruled out faulty GPU as well\n\nNext, i tried connecting my SSD which has windows on itself, to try and get to the OS right. And this seems to break things. After i connected it, i got to the same error as before. VGA lits up, stays lit and PC won't pass POST nor boot itself or show BIOS. Nothing, just a black screen. So i tried switching cables to rule out their breaking. Didn't help. Tried hooking the SSD to different PC to rule out faulty drive. Worked like a charm, so SSD is fine. Then i tried connecting HDD only that doesn't have Windows on it, same problem. I tried HDD from the other PC with working windows on it, same problem. I tried all the SATA ports on my motherboard possible. Didn't work either.\n\nSo the question now is, what could be the cause now? Since the VGA is lit up, it points to either GPU or iGPU, but those are fine. Problem are drives and not even them particularly, but the MoBo doing weird stuff once i plug them in. I tried updating BIOS, but that didn't work. When i connect bootable USB with windows, it gets me to windows installation, so the chipset shouldn't be dead either. What is it then? What else i could possibly try to do to fix it? I'm quite lost on this one. Thanks for any help or advice. \n\nSorry for the essay jesus Christ.",

Turned it off for a while then when I powered it back on after the LUKS screen it just goes black. My main SSD is just a boot drive so I tried to reinstall but the only OS I could get working from a USB was KDE Neon with safe graphics with the error box saying \"NOMODESET\" is why it only works in safe graphics which is a grub boot flag, if I remove the flag I get a black screen after the BIOS. I've tried Windows as well now and once the GPU drivers try to install I just get a black screen. Anyone got any ideas? Ryzen 5600G/Asus B550 Motherboard. Did a bios update as well but that changed nothing. Cheers",

I immediately get \"Device self check failed\"\n* In windows installation command prompt I messed with the \"bootrec\" and \"bootsect\" commands. End result is I still can't boot from the drive but here are the details:\n \"bootsect /nt60 SYS\" gives me \"Successfully updated FAT32 filesystem bootcode\". \"bootrec /RebuildBcd\" identifies a windows installation on C:/Windows, but I get \"Access denied\" if I choose to \"add installation to boot list\". \"bootrec /fixMbr\" says \"operation completed successfully\" but \"bootrec /FixBoot\" also gives me \"Access denied\"\n\n\nI can insert the drive as a secondary M2 NVME in another windows machine, and there's a chance I can recover the files from it that way. Can I install windows on it through that machine with the \"keeping all  files and settings\" option, or will windows only let you install that way on the drive it booted windows from?

    "text": "Small background, a local computer store was liquidating and I got two HP desktops for dirt cheap. I'm mainly focused on the [TP01-1016](https://support.hp.com/bg-en/document/c06676502) but the other's a [690-0079](https://support.hp.com/ca-en/document/c06507078). I heard that the store bought these refurbished to salvage GPUs from. [This website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03653200) suggests that some Secure Boot configurations will force you to configure the system before it will accept new/different graphics cards. I can't get the 690 to display anything and the box says it had a 1660ti, so my theory is this PC's basically locked as I can't reconfigure the UEFI without the OG GPU even though the i7 has integrated graphics. Thus I'm focusing on the TP01.\n\nThe TP01 boots fine without modification. I swapped in the PSU from the 690 because the TP01's PSU was 180w and no PCIe power. It still works fine. Whenever install a GPU I get no output, but it turns on (I can hear the HDD spinning, etc like it's otherwise booting just fine). \n\nI have two GPUs to try; one is an rx580 requiring 8-pin power and one is... well, I don't remember what it is but it's a much older Zotac brand card and does not require external power. 400w _may_ be too little to power the rx580 (it should be under 200w and I don't think the rest of the PC is pulling &gt;200w; I did disconnect the HDD and optical drive just in case but it seemed to have no difference). There's no reason for the Zotac to not work anyway. I would try another PSU but HP's got some proprietary connectors for the mobo and I don't feel like trying to hotwire anything.\n\nI tried following the instructions from the [HP support page](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03653200) (same as linked before) which is basically disable secure boot and enable legacy boot; problem is there's no legacy boot option in this UEFI. I also cleared the TPU \"just in case\" but it seemed to help nothing.\n\nAt this point, the TP01 will boot without a GPU installed but will not (or rather, will boot but display nothing) with either GPU installed. Any tips or suggestions on getting the TP01 to accept the rx580 would make me very happy. I'm willing to try suggestions on getting the 690 running as well. \n\nNote: By \"will not boot\" I mean it won't display anything, even a POST message. One monitor will quickly say it's switching to power-saving mode when it sees that something's connected but otherwise I get no response. I have tried multiple monitors and cables.

Tried again and the computer will shut off when I play a game even on low setting. First thought was the cooling, temps will be in the high 70 and pass 80 the computer will shut off. I proceeded to fix the overheating by upgrading the cpu cooler that my friend had given me, a corsair h60. Then another problem rose up with the ram that  would make the computer not show up on the monitor and would not give  any power going through the keyboard and mouse when turned on. Ended up fixing that as well by updating bios and proceeded to use it afterwords and will not shut off. During all this time i was doing all of this at my friends house because him and his brother was helping me with all of these issues. Now I had taken it to my house and and tried using the computer and played the game apex legends for maybe like 3 games then again the computer shut off. The day before this, I told my friend to use the computer at his house and told me that he played for hours playing elden ring and  that the computer never shut off. So right now I honestly don\u2019t know what the problem is, after all of that it ended  up still turning off.

After trying to run my file, I realised that the VScode terminal was unable to run flutter commands. I launched the windows terminal app to try to identify the problem but my powershell and cmd doesn't even load. Powershell 7.2.1 loads fine but the default windows powershell does not. [This is a screenshot of my terminal](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5u0qT.png). The issue isn't caused by the terminal app as the same problem happens when I launch powershell or try to open a cmd window.\n\nOpening cmd a command prompt window does nothing as the window doesn't even show up until 10 minutes later. It might also be worth mentioning that the commands end up working eventually. Although this was not the case a few hours ago when everything ran immediately.\n\nOnce powershell / cmd loads, the issue does not repeat itself until I reboot. The same goes for my commands that just hang. They also all load at the same time. So if I were to try to launch cmd and also run a command in powershell, they would hang for an extended amount of time and eventually the cmd window would show up and the command would run at the same time.

The laptop was off at that time but this caused the faulty usb port to spark up.\n\nWhen I plug it into power now, the battery charging light turns on but no sign of life when pressing the power button.\n\nI have already tried holding the power button for a min and discharging the static, both with the battery plugged in and unplugged and both on battery only and AC power only. I have also tried disconnecting the daughter board, I tried removing and trying different combinations for the two ram sticks as well as removed all the drives in it. \n\nI don't have a multimeter to test the power adapter or the socket but I assume they work because the battery light was initially orange, and then turned blue after a few hours indicating that the battery is fully charged.\n\nI also assume that the power button itself (which is part of the keyboard) is working because whenever I spam it the power indicator (second light) of the laptop flashes blue for a split second, meaning that there at least is a response from the computer.\n\nDo you guys think this is a fried motherboard? Or what else could it be? I'm open to any suggestions and any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much everyone.",

    "text": "Hey guys, I just recently upgraded my mobo and CPU from 8700k to 12700kf with the Asus z690 ddr4 tuf board. When I first installed my old ram I couldn't even boot, the Mobo had a light lit for a DIMM issue so I removed 2 of my 4 sticks and finally booted. PC seemed to work fine until I played games and it started closing the game and I got a vram errors, and even hard crashed my PC and uninstalled my gpu drivers, which I thought was odd because I have a new 3080ti. So I pulled the PC out again and reseated the GPU, Started working fine again I updated my driver's and windows then tried stress testing it on cyberpunk max settings and the 3080ti seemed fine, but then I played squad with a friend and after gaming for a while my programs would start closing along with the game, which I assumed was due to having less or faulty ram. So next day I went and picked up another 32gb of ram and popped it in the computer. Everything worked like a charm, no game or programs crashing, stress tested with 3dmark and worked great. And after that one day of good use I've been turning my computer on and for about 30-2hrs it will work perfectly, then my audio will cut out and programs will slowly start to freeze and lock up and even windows will do it too, I can't even turn the computer off within windows, I can't open anything, but my mouse will still track around the screen and I can even click on task manager but it won't show me the processes or usage of anything, the computer becomes completely useless at this point. I have no clue what else to do, if anyone could help me out it would be much appreciated! \nMy full specs are:\n850w psu\n32gb ram\nWindows drive SSD 2TB Samsung qvo\nAsus tuf z690 ddr4\nI7 12700kf\n3080ti \nWindows 10 newest update",

Basically after 3-5 hours of use the computer just decides it hates running anything more intensive than an opera tab and apps will start crashing, photoshop and games will just lock up and close. Opera will crash reading that there is not enough memory and discord will tell me that I've ran out of memory. I thought the initial problem would be ram so I begrudgingly replaced my old sticks and put two brand new sticks in around half a year ago and the problem never left. I've noticed apps like Dota 2 or Elden Ring will read as using moderate power for the majority of the time however when things start crashing it'll read Very High on pretty much every non background task I'm running. Specs are Nvidia Geforce 1060, Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 x 6, ROG Strix X370-F Mobo, Corsair 850W PSU and 2 Asus 8GB DDR4 sticks. One last note is that over the last month I'd receive errors stating that my ports weren't supplying enough power to my external SSD which was resolved by switching cable but it's got me quite suspicious that it's my power supply dying from overuse.",

I have a wifi card which is also not working though im not sure if the two are connected since the issue is different (just says cant connect to network and never does) \n\n\n\\*\\*during the video you can hear a low chime playing multiple times, this is because I disconnected while in a discord call, and discord is continuing to try and reconnect me, at 1:19 you can hear the windows chimes\\*\\*  \n[Video recording starts right after the initial disconnect](https://youtu.be/1z92vPn1SOA)",

I just found it to have very strange behaviour, when pluged in to an SATA port it doesnt even show up in BIOS therefore it wouldnt show up in windows as well. BUT when i plug it in via an Drive adapter for usb it works perfektly fine.... i checked the SATA ports and they work, its also not an Power problem since when i replace the drive for another one everything  works as expected. i also went ahead and repartioned the drive using gparted (kubuntu) but still nothing had changed. any ideas what i can do or what might be the problem?",

All the RAM checks out beautifully with MemTest86+; I cycled through and tested each stick individually when I first noticed the problem, and also tested each stick individually in each slot that was being populated (to rule out slot issues). The RAM is inserted in the approved sequence. I am currently running Windows Server 2019 Datacentre and using this as a Hyper-V generator/testbed.\n\nWhen the system boots, regardless of how or why it went down, upon boot-up the diagnostic numbers stop at the code for memory analysis (3 &amp; 4, AFAIR). And then it reboots. And it does this precisely 10 times in a row, no more, no less. And on the 11th restart, it passes that internal diagnostic and proceeds to boot into Windows.\n\nAt no time has this machine ever experienced a bluescreen or any other RAM-related error while Windows has been up and running. The system logs are absolutely clean on sudden shutdowns, and I have a UPS that will send a graceful shutdown signal in case of an outage.\n\nThis does not affect me in any negative way, it\u2019s just an annoying mystery. I mean, it does take a lot longer to boot up (and that first POST diagnostic takes a lot longer than the other 9), but if anyone might have a clue as to what\u2019s going on here, it would be appreciated.\n\nI have another T7500 that doesn\u2019t do this little party trick at all.

I did this (full delete and reinstall), but the problem persists. \n\nThe only physical issues I can spot with the card are a bit of dust (sadly I don\u2019t have any compressed air on hand to blow it off) but it\u2019s been dustier and still functioned. \n\nIt\u2019s getting a bit old (5 years about) so the sneaking suspicion I have is that it\u2019s dead but it was working perfectly fine a couple hours before so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case. \n\nLike I said at the start, I\u2019m pretty stumped.

    "text": "Hello folks! \n\nAfter spending some time repairing retro tech and some simpler electronics I decided to have a go at something more complicated. I bought an HP Folio 1040 G2 on the cheap, untested, allegedly with no battery installed. When I got it, the battery sure was there, and the laptop worked all fine, even installed Windows 10 and all. Windows would see the battery as \"plugged\" without anything mentioning charging, whereas when switched off the laptop would start flashing an orange LED near the DC jack, indicating a problem. \n\nFirst troubleshooting showed no signs of problem other than some different from standard values on the charger IC - BQ24736. I desoldered the chip, soldered in a brand new replacement and it still does not charge. I got a replacement battery as well, and it is not being charged either. \n\nWhen in the HP UEFI Hardware Diagnostics, the original battery is shown as \"not installed\", and the replacement is visible, with the comment: Charge State: Blown Fuse. \n\nI'm kind of dumbfounded. Every fuse near the charging IC or the main power line and the MOSFETS (two in total) are perfectly fine. Checked the diode that's connected to the charging IC and it's open line from one side, voltage drops on the other side - so it's fine as well, i guess? I connected the negative multimeter probe to ground and poked around the tiny SMD caps around the charging IC as well, and didn't find any shorts. A brand new HP charger did not remedy the problem either.\n\nHas anyone perhaps encountered a similar problem? What else could be the fault here? I'm at my wits' end with this laptop; just don't know what else could go wrong. \n\nI would be very much thankful for any ideas on this thing here. Cheers!",

    "text": " Hi everyone, this will probably be a decently long post so..\n\nTLDR: when my GPU is in the case or the backplate is touching the sides of the case, a static shock on the top panel will cause the computer to black screen and restart. If the gpu is placed outside of the case I can zap the chassis as much as I want and dont get a restart.\n\nThe longer version! So basically when moving my computer one day i noticed that it restarted when i touched the top of the case to adjust it. It is winter here and my room is pretty dry so I can get lots of static. I eventually had the realization that it would restart whenever I would zap the top panel or the right side panel. This got me to investigate what was going on and I found that if my gpu is on the outside of the case then the restarts will not occur when zapping the chassis. Then I thought maybe the gpu backplate wasnt properly grounded or maybe the back io bracket for the gpu. I shocked both the IO bracket and the backplate and the computer did not restart, everything was still running fine. I tried shocking the power supply casing in case it was an issue with the power supply but the computer still was running fine. So now I have no clue what is going on and why I only get restarts when the backplate of the GPU or back bracket of the GPU is touching the metal of the case, especially since zapping the backplate and back bracket by themselves didnt cause a restart, it was only when they were in contact with the case. Obviously the solution for now is to stop zapping the case but I would really like to understand/fix the source of this problem and I am at a loss. Thank you for any help!",

I installed it today onto an Msi x570 gaming plus motherboard with no issue until I got to the cord side of things. I installed the rgb as described (I didn\u2019t use the controller I just plugged it into a jrainbow port) and using a splitter, plugged both fans into the cpu1 port. When turning the pc back on everything lit up and the fans spun but the pc wouldn\u2019t post and the cpu light on my mobo was lit. After removing the splitter and putting one fan into CPU1 and the other into pump1 it posted but the fan plugged into the pump port was quite slow and loud. After pushing the fan speeds using msi afterburner all the way up for each fan the one plugged into pump1 wouldn\u2019t go any faster and the one plugged into CPU1 was going just fine. After switching them around the issue remained and then for some reason using the splitter worked again but one fan still had that same issue. Looking into bios I turned off smart fan and putting it on max they both ran loudly but equally. Setting it back to default makes the noise come back. Wondering if there\u2019s a solution to make them work normally or if I\u2019m just stuck with a big semi loud fan that only brought my CPU temps down by about 10\u00b0.

I quarantined it and removed it and then did an offline scan with Windows Defender which didn't seem to alert me to anything once my PC rebooted so I hope that means nothing was found.  I then ran a full scan again and found Trojan:HTML/Phish.PAAL!MTB which was not reported the first time.  Quarantined and removed this one as well.  Doing a third scan now and becoming increasingly worried.  Any idea what actions I should take?  I used to use Norton before they started doing really shady crap but I've since just relied on Windows Security for protection.\n\nI should add I use Firefox and always keep uBlock Origin on and am quite paranoid about where I browse and even more so about what I download so I'm really at a loss as to how these got here.",

    "text": "A lot of details below, but the short of it is that I'm in the middle of doing a Windows reinstall to a new SSD. I've got a new Windows installation on a new SSD and I'm migrating files. I've had this weird issue twice where I copy files to a unrelated internal hard drive from my old installation, and when I switch to the new one, the changes I made are missing.\n\nMore specifically: Before I started, I had Windows 10 installed on on a 9-year old SSD, plus three other internal hard drives. One of these hard drives (referred to below as the \"bad\" drive) recently had bad sectors, but it seemed to work fine for the moment. All data on it has been backed up to my NAS. I decided to replace the SSD and the bad hard drive and reinstall Windows.\n\nI got the new SSD, but the replacement for the bad hard drive hasn't arrived yet. I disconnected all the original drives, and connected the new SSD and installed Windows 10 Pro OEM. Then I disconnected the new SSD and reconnected the old SSD and other hard drives. This morning I went through the old SSD, copying anything important and making notes of Windows settings. I copied these files to a directory on the bad drive (since that's were I had been backing stuff up before the drive started to go bad). I reconnected the new SSD and booted it up. I tried to open one of the files I had just copied over. Windows said it couldn't find the file. Then it said there were errors on the drive and it made me reboot to scan the drive. When I rebooted, several directories of files I had just moved to the bad hard drive were gone.\n\nOkay, I'm thinking, the bad drive is worse than I thought, and I shouldn't have tried using it to transfer files. So I switched back to the old SSD and went through the process again, copying files to one of my good drives. I switched to the new SSD, rebooted, and found the same thing had happened. All the files I copied there were missing. And they were still missing when I switched back to the old SSD, so they're not just hidden.\n\nSo I think Windows must be reverting changes somewhere, but I can't figure out how or why. I think for attempt three I'm going to copy my files over to my NAS and to a flash drive to be safe. Right now I'm more worried about understanding what is going on so that I don't lose data in the future.\n\nThe way I see it, the problem could either be that the data is not being saved correctly to the drive, or that it is being reverted. I tested writing a file to the good hard drive and rebooting and the file was still there. So I think data is being reverted somehow. But how would that be happening?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

Often times it will literally say \"internet access\" yet it doesnt let you go on any websites (it does say No Internet Access sometimes too, its pretty 50/50). The error that comes up every time is DNS\\_PROBE\\_FINISHED\\_NO\\_INTERNET. It'll often say it cant find whatever websites DNS address or something. Windows Network Diagnostics sometimes fixes it, but it usually takes a few tries and doesnt always work. It'll always say that it fixed \"The default gateway is not available\", however it detects \"The connection between your access point, router or cable modem and The internet is broken.\"  \nPlease do not recommend using ethernet cable as we do not have cable, and its a multi-device house so wifi is our only option.  \nThe internet is generally also slower on the laptop than any other device.  \nKeep in mind that it does have moments where it works, and sometimes it works for hours at a time with not much issue, but then out of nowhere itll do this for hours, and we cant fix it until it finds a way to somehow fix itself for awhile.\n\n**Things we have tried:**  \n\\-A few cmd things, /flushdns, netsh winsock reset, I was following a video so i dont quite remember the details  \nuninstalling the network drivers so when restarting the laptop, they automatically reinstall.\n\n\\-checking if any of my drivers were out of date (they arent, according to the HP site).\n\n\\-Changing the main network drivers to other ones it has installed.\n\n\\-Restarting the router millions of times (this sometimes works on the millionth time.)  \n\\-Its not a matter of distance, my moms laptop is often way closer to the router than I am to it and it does not change anything.  \n\\-changing the network ipv4 dns address to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8/) or 8.8.4.4  \n\\-Restarting the laptop lol  \n\\-**buying a usb wifi adapter, it did not speed up the internet like it promises but seems to be working.

(It often ranges anywhere from 16+, sometimes even 30-50, it fluctuates), this is on both laptops in the house (when its actually working)\n\nWhen i press generate report on Windows Network Diagnostics, **it says the issues found are:**  \n\"The connection between your access point, router or cable modem and The internet is broken: The network gateway is accessible, but Windows couldn't receive network traffic from the Internet.\" (Detected)  \n\"The default gateway is not available:  \nThe default gateway is a device that connects to a local network or computer to the Internet. A broadband modem or router is usually the default gateway.\" (Fixed)\n\nIf there is a way to directly give a long lengthy report that tells a tech genius what the exact problem is and how to fix it, then I will gladly do it and send that.\n\nIt seems to have only started doing this ever since we moved, it never did anything like this before the move.

(ASUS Prime X570-Pro Ryzen 3 AM4 Mobo, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, ROG GeForce 3070ti video card, CORSAIR Dominator Platinum RGB 16GB x 2 Memory, EVGA SuperNOVA 750 GT 80 Plus Gold 750W PSU)\n\nLast night he came screaming and yelling downstairs and said the computer start sparking and popping.  It had heavy electric smell and it's now dead.  I thought it was just a dead power supply and I had an extra PSU laying around.  I plugged it in and received no joy. The RGB on the mobo lights up, RGB on the memory lights up, but no boot, no test LEDs, no fans spinning.\n\nHe wasn't poking around in the case or doing anything stupid, he was just gaming.  But, full transparency, he has the typical RGB overload that most kids have.  He has the Corsair H100i RGB CPU cooler, the LianLi Stimer cables -- all that stuff.\n\n1. What can I do to narrow down what went wrong and how it went wrong?  I pulled the Mobo, no obvious charring or electric shorts.  \n2. Are there good videos on how to test PSU health?\n3. Are there good videos on testing MoBo health?",

Though i can record with little to no latency issues, my monitor's refresh rate is 165hz, so when i record my fps go below 165 causing micro-sttuters. I've already optimized the basic things like the scalability, gpu optimization and basically everything i could've found on YT for Valorant optimizations, it still goes below 165 fps when i start recording through OBS or ShadowPlay :(    \n\n\nIs there any software besides OBS and Nvidia ShadowPlay which doesn't cause my fps to go below 165? Or are there any special optimizations i can do to boost them? Any replies appreciated &lt;3",

Unplug - plug the monitor\n2. Switched between HDMI ports in my GPU\n3. Updated my GPU drivers\n4. Upgraded from Windows 10-&gt;11\n5. Changed the HDMI cable\n\nI have a RX 5700 XT GPU with a 9600KF processor and 16GB RAMs 3000Mhz.\n\nAs a note, both monitors work individually with the HDMI cable, and I saw that i can use my monitor that doesn't turn on as second monitor for my Mac and for my other laptop with Windows. I also want to mention that I have a DisplayPort adaptor for the cable to plug it into the GPU. Shall I consider buying a new DisplayPort adaptor? \n\nIf anyone can share some thoughts I would much appreciate. Thank you!",

I've ran Windows Security/Microsoft Defender full system scans and offline scans with no issues showing up, and have also ran a full scan with Malwarebytes on one PC with the rootkit option enabled which took over 12 hours and no issues there. On the PC I've also ran the Malwarebytes full scan (might not have done the offline scan on this one) I decided to run a full scan with Bitdefender since the malicious Afterburner file I uploaded to virustotal wasn't detected to have anything malicious by Malwarebytes but did have things detected by Bitdefender and I've read Bitdefender is possibly the best AV\n\nVirustotal results for malicious Afterburner - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0b72865ee76d0fe8ce86da24035e723bfe1460c9b7ca43f9dc308653ae20a868\n\nBitdefender detected one issue in the entire scan which was labeled Generic.CoreBotC.38E3FFEE found in pagefile.sys. I've since done another scan in Bitdefender recovery mode and deleted the detected item but after another scan in Windows the item was detected again so it's not being removed\n\nI'm unsure if this is related to what happened to my main PC, and unsure if it's a false positive. This PC has a pretty fresh install of Windows 10 and hasn't gone anywhere or downloaded anything malicious. I have plugged in 2 flash drives that also have been plugged into my main PC during the incident so it's possible aside from the network that anything could have transferred that way but I did scan the drives fully with Defender and had no issues but will be soon scanning them again with Bitdefender. \n\nIf you know what this is please let me know!",

We looked up articles, tried tweaking BIOS settings, Disabling and Uninstalling antivirus, nothing was working to get his Windows Updates to work. So then we tried the route of installing a fresh copy. This is where things get weird. We made a Windows 10 installation USB out of a 64 GB Memorex USB drive. And we tweaked BIOS to appropriate settings, (Secure Boot disabled, Legacy + UEFI boot mode, and pressed F12 on bootup to boot from the USB.) But his computer just refused to boot off the USB. It would hang on the startup screen and restart. This USB was made from the official Microsoft Media Creation Tool, so we didn't know where we were going wrong. Then we thought there was a slight chance his computer didn't support USB booting. So we tried a DVD with an ISO file from the before mentioned tool. We burned the DVD with IMGBurn, and we tried it out. No difference, it does the same thing as the USB. We even tried Different OS'es with the same steps, but nothing was working. So me and my friend are kinda at a dead end. So if anyone, ANYONE, can help us, we would be ever so thankful.",

    "text": "**UPDATE**: *I originally believed my dock to be Thunderbolt 3 compatible, but it is not. However, my questions still remain.* \n\n**Device:**  [iOGear USB-C Dock](https://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-USB-C-Docking-Station-Delivery/dp/B01FSTNT82)\n\n**Background:** I use the USB-C dock listed above as my docking solution. My primary work is in audio engineering, so on most days I have a display and multiple USB powered devices connected to the dock at once. Typically, the following devices are connected:\n\n* Samsung T5 SSD Drive\n* Scarlett Solo Audio Interface\n* Komplete Kontrol 88 key (*basically a USB powered piano for music*)\n* USB Powered Monitor Light\n* Dell 4k 27-inch Display (HDMI Port)\n* Single TB cable connection Dock to my laptop (*I swap between a Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, Dell XPS 13*)\n\nWhen all devices are connected, I experience a range of issues that come and go. Most times, my display will either output a terrible resolution like, **1600 x 1200 at 60hz**, or **4k at 30hz**. Other times, I receive an error stating there isn't enough USB power to operate a device, which is usually my Scarlett Audio interface. I have swapped connection cables, used different power outlets for the dock, tried different computers, different monitors, etc. Still get the similar run of issues. The only way to avoid these issues is to unplug everything and only connect two devices at most (usually my display and my monitor light).\n\n*I should note that each of these devices work to their fullest when connected to the dock by themselves, or when a* ***limited*** *number of other devices are connected to the dock. My problem is I cannot get all devices to work properly when* ***most/all*** *other ports are occupied on the dock.*\n\n**My question is,** before I ditch my current dock for something else, is this an inherent limitation of all docking solutions? Is it unrealistic of me to expect ***any*** powered USB-C/TB3 dock to let me use all ports at once with full range of performance on each port? Any similar experiences to mine out there?\n\nAppreciate it!",

The laptop's display may not work - Plugging in an external monitor and restarting fixes the issue. The laptop's display will work as normal until it's shut down again. \n2. Keyboards are wonky - The attached keyboard and even external keyboards do not work properly. Pressing buttons causes context menus to appear. Similar to when a modifier is stuck. Not fixed by pressing all of the modifiers to un-stick them. \n\nAll seemingly random after a restart. All fixed by restarting.

Tried everything with the same 'failure/unable to act' message appearing after all of them until I opted for the PC Reset. Which then automatically updated by itself for some reason.\n\nOh, and I'm just now seeing the simpler version of this problem now that I'm finger-typing this out. I can't System Restore anymore because there's nothing to System Restore from? And I can't rollback the update through the Advanced Recovery method either because the PC Reset made the current patch its only state of reference.......\n\nI have no idea what to do.    \nBut I tried all the quick fix-its already, from the usual Uninstall Drivers/Reinstall Drivers, Command Prompt ipconfig &gt; netsh int ip reset/release etc., and of course modem &amp; router on/off.\n\n*I have no idea why my laptop randomly wouldn't start up anymore*, but even turning it off and back on during the initial Restart Failure Loop would just bring up the Repair Menu again. There wasn't anything else to do except PC Reset, which ruined everything..... I don't know where to go from here. Please help if you can, thank you.\n\n~~~~~ ~~~~~\n\n**Tl;dr:** Usual problem of Windows Update leading to broken internet connections. Rolled back through Advanced Recovery and then postponed updates until no longer issue (but usually would just happen again and no community or official fix.)\n\nHowever, today, it went as followed:\n\n1\\.  Everything is fine &gt; idle PC &gt; Then fans start working up hard &gt; Closed all tabs and windows &gt; Decide to restart\n\n2\\.

Ever since the upgrade, I get random black screens in games, but my PC doesn't appear to crash or restart, I have to press the reset button on the case.  AMD Radeon software also does not detect any issues.\n\nSometimes, the black screens occur within the first minute of starting the game, other times, they may occur after 20 minutes of playing.  The black screens have happened while playing The Outer Worlds and PGA 2K21.  I primarily work from home, however, and can work 8+ hours without any issues whatsoever.\n\nI run a CPU/GPU custom loop with 2x240mm and 1x120mm rads.  Temps under load are fine.  GPU junction stays under 80-85c, while GPU temp stays under 60c.\n\nLast night, I even reinstalled Windows on a freshly formatted drive, and after installing just the chipset GPU drivers, fired up The Outer Worlds and had a black screen within 2 minutes.\n\nIs this a case of these two specific games having an issue with 32:9 aspect ratios?  When these two games are running, everything appears to be fine visually and there are no stutters.\n\nI flaired this post as a hardware issue because the only thing that changed was my monitor, but it may be a software issue.\n\n**PC specs**\n\n* Ryzen 2600 non-x\n* PowerColor RX 5700 XT Liquid Devil\n* 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO @ 3000MHz, CL15\n* Seasonic FOCUS Gold 650\n* Windows 10 Education 21H2 (also had black screens on v2004)\n* Radeon software 21.10.2 (also had black screens on 22.1.2)\n* Other programs running: Synology drive client\n\n**Troubleshooting I've tried**\n\n* Close all running programs\n* Verified game files in Steam\n* In The Outer Worlds, tried Fullscreen and Windowed Fullscreen modes\n* Clean reinstall of Windows on a formatted drive (this one blows me away that it didn't fix it)\n* Reduced monitor refresh rate from 120Hz to 100Hz in Windows for the hell of it.  I was able to run the game for a few minutes without a black screen, but I died in a very short time, so it's impossible to say if this fixed it.\n* Tried AMD Radeon versions 22.1.2 and 21.10.2, using DDU to uninstall prior version each time\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

However, they have always had the same issue. Inevitably, after a few days or weeks they crash and stop working (wiping and resetting the pc doesn't seem to fix this). I then have to manually reboot them. I've had this happen accross multiple computers and on windows 7, 10 and ubuntu. \n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n*  Is this normal, or is there a way to set up a server so that it does not eventually crash? \n* If I purchase a NAS device, would this be less likely to crash?\n* My goal is to run a server that I don't have to keep checking up on everyday to see if it is still running. What is the best way to achieve this?\n\nThank you so much in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

Essentially like calling to ur own door\n\naltho its always active because the moment i pickup the phone i can commnicate, the phone does not ring. but that broke, and i wanted to make a diy fix out of interest but got stuck.  \n\n\nSo the idea behind it is to use 2 Arduino Nano devices with both a speaker and microphone module attached. This is not a problem to assemble for me... the problem is more in the actual transmitting of the audio and playing the audio.\n\nSo arduino is opensource based, meaning this should be possible. I have the cable going from the doorbel to the phone so that is not an issue. I have more of an issue of how i would make them both communicate like calling on a phone but always active when i pickup the phone. Meaning i dont know how i make the Arduino at the door always send audio to my Arduino coming from the microphone module, going to the second arduino thats put into the phone that will then output the audio into the speaker module also connected to the second arduino, so making me able to hear what the people outside say. then also the other way around so they can hear what i say.\n\ni have lots of time to think but im very stuck at this moment and would appreciate the help or ideas.\n\nThanks in regards.\n\nif any more questions please let me know..",

I wanted to use 2 of them, give 2 to another worker, and use our samsung sticks to enhance 2 other computers, so all of us would have 16 GB, enough for our work.  \nBut, after I switched the old samsung stick with a pair of the newer teamgroup ones, i get some BSODs after some time of use. it happens if i use one, two... it happened in another m710s too.  \nI updated the bios and nothing. tried with the sfc and dism commands that some sites recommend, nothing.\n\nIs there an incompatibility issue between that lenovo workstation and that stick?  \n\n\nRecently, a friend tested in another pc (i dont have its specs). It survived a day of gaming, but it bsod-ed on viewing a video. Could it be that these sticks need an special config on the bios?",

Lately, I've had issues connecting and I usually have to reset my computer or my wifi so I've gotten into the habit of shutting down my Windows 10, MSI GL65 each night before bed. Last night, I watched some tv on my computer and then shut it down. This laptop was brand new last May.\n\nThis morning I woke up, hit the power button and nothing happened. It definitely had half a charge last night, so I was surprised. I plugged in the power cord and still nothing. No lights and no response. I hit the mouse, keyboard, and power button repeatedly. I unplugged the power cord from the computer to try the machine running off of just battery and hit the power button several times to no avail. I noticed a very low buzz or hum coming from the power brick. I plugged it back in and noticed white power indicator lights came on. I hit the button and the computer booted. Once in Windows, I confirmed that I had over 60% battery. I do not hear that hum or buzz anymore from the power brick.\n\nWhat do you think was going on? I don't remember any new updates happening and no new updates are available right now. I need this machine for work and I'm concerned I'll get locked out again. Anything I can look out for or do to identify a failure likely to happen again in the future? The machine is still under warranty so I am not inclined to attempt opening it or removing the battery.",

I installed it today onto an Msi x570 gaming plus motherboard with no issue until I got to the cord side of things. I installed the rgb as described (I didn\u2019t use the controller I just plugged it into a jrainbow port) and using a splitter, plugged both fans into the cpu1 port. When turning the pc back on everything lit up and the fans spun but the pc wouldn\u2019t post and the cpu light on my mobo was lit. After removing the splitter and putting one fan into CPU1 and the other into pump1 it posted but the fan plugged into the pump port was quite slow and loud. After pushing the fan speeds using msi afterburner all the way up for each fan the one plugged into pump1 wouldn\u2019t go any faster and the one plugged into CPU1 was going just fine. After switching them around the issue remained and then for some reason using the splitter worked again but one fan still had that same issue. Looking into bios I turned off smart fan and putting it on max they both ran loudly but equally. Setting it back to default makes the noise come back. Wondering if there\u2019s a solution to make them work normally or if I\u2019m just stuck with a big semi loud fan that only brought my CPU temps down by about 10\u00b0.

    "text": "Aight so i need help with this one boys. I've been casually gaming with my gf when suddenly the Blue Screen dropped on me. I thought allright, hard restart and here we go, it worked in the future. It got me to the BSOD once again, with the error code machine check exception. Never got this one so i though aight weird, let's try again. This time it didn't even boot, just a black screen so i turned it off again and waited for about 15 minutes. After powering it back on again, the blue screen jumps once again but with a percentage showing this time so i waited, but it didn't move. After yet another restart i got black screen only again, and then i noticed there is a red LED lit up on the Ez Debug VGA part of my motherboard. It wasn't lit up when i got the Blue screen, just now when i have black screen only. No matter how much i restart now, i cannot get to the BIOS not even to Windows as before. \n\nSo i googled about the LED and i found some fixes and tried them out. Picked out the MoBo battery, didn't work. Tried running with one RAM at a time, didn't work. Tried unplugging everything unnecessary like front panel USB and audio, cooling fans, non essential hard drives. Nothing helped. \n\nI'm quite desperate now just wishing it's not the GPU dying on me since they are quite pricey this time of decade lol. Any tips what to try next? Thanks guys.",

She submitted them and it took her to a page asking for bank details and whatnot - so at this point she figured it was a scam.

Even during the hot summer, I never hit 80C in any of the games I played. As long as I cap the fps at 60 for the more demanding games, my CPU temps have always stayed at 65C or even lower. But starting December, the temps have been getting more and more inconsistent with really high spikes.\n\nFor example, for most games and tasks I do, the temps stick below 70C. But at least once every two weeks, I'll get spikes that go all the way up to 96C. Earlier today, Mass Effect Legendary sat at 58C to 60C but the moment I closed the game, it spiked to 88C without much CPU usage reported on Task Manager. Also earlier today, I launched Halo Infinite and the CPU hit the 90s while loading. Normally it stays at 70C when opening the game and 55C to 60C when actually playing a match. \n\nI noticed this started happening after I tried out Battlefield 5 and updated MSI Afterburner to the newest version, although I don't really see how that would change anything. That was the first time I saw the CPU hit 85C.\n\nSo yeah, I have no idea what's causing this, as I have no experience with liquid coolers. As far as I know, all the fans are working. The tubes feel like fluid is moving through them, and at the moment one feels warmer than the other. The air that's exhausting is cool, only warming up when I've been playing or using Chrome for a while. I don't see any noticeable changes as far as hardware goes.\n\nAnyway, I'm mostly just posting this to learn. I plan on getting a mesh case and air cooler before summer. If anyone has suggestions on what could be causing the spikes or what to even look for, I would appreciate it.",

It crashes on post if I keep trying to mess with it, and if I let it be for a couple hours I'll get lucky and it goes to windows. I checked task manager and it doesn't show the GPU. Anyways, since I know this is unrepairable by my own means (yes, I tried sticking it in the oven) I was wondering if anyone knows if I could buy a motherboard of a different spec but same size and generation. I found one on eBay which claims to work, and it has an RTX 3080 with a 10875h. Everything looks to be the same size, I just wanted some validation, or just tell me I'm stupid. Either works. tl;dr laptop gpu is dead, want to swap in a different (possibly higher spec) Mobo since I'd spend prob 2k+ in professional repairs \nThanks",

After the recent software update, suddenly TikTok is in my phone, and hidden pretty well in my app tray on the end of the very last page. Never opened, no account attached. No one has access to my phone except me, and i believe in the idea that any computer making the wrong noise gets the death penalty, so every single \"unknown app install\"/other sets of permissions are off, and were never turned on from the day my phone was activated.\n\nWhy did this happen? Can i prevent it from happening again in future? I deleted the app, though my phone lagged really hard trying to do it for a few minutes, and im struggling to find any info about this issue that isnt from 2 years ago on apple. The number of times ive found reddit threads with this question but full of deleted comments by the moderators and locked doesnt make me feel any better about it :(\n\nWill answer if you need more info, this is just freaking me out a little bit.

    "text": "Hey all, been having this issue for a few months now and am hoping to find a permanent fix. My computer runs perfectly fine until I play games installed on my SSD, after which a certain point my PC essentially stops working - mouse moves fine, keyboard etc. but when I open apps, they just attempt to open and never do. No error codes or messages or anything... just no response, or a white screen with the spinning wheel. Luckily, restarting my PC has been a consistent, albeit temporary fix until I play enough that it happens again. \n\nAny idea what might be the cause, and how I might go about fixing this? I suspect it has to do with the SSD but not entirely positive. I can guarantee it has to do with the games because I recently left for vacation for 2.5 weeks while leaving my PC on, and when I returned it was still working properly. On the other hand I may have to restart up to 3 times a day with heavy gaming. I\u2019m on Windows 10. Thanks!",

    "text": "I built my PC around 2 years ago and haven't had a single issue with it until now.  I'm definitely not a genius on this stuff, so I thought I'd post here for some help.  \n\n\nA few nights ago, I was playing some video games and had some audio issues right as I was about to get off.  I didn't think much of it, the headset I have is pretty cheap so I figured that was probably all it was.  I shut off my computer and went to bed.  The next morning, I booted it up and after about 10 minutes, my cursor and audio started lagging and stuttering.  After messing around with both the headset and mouse, updating and rolling back several video and audio drivers, I came to the conclusion that it's probably a hardware issue within the PC itself.  \n\n\nMy problem now is that I'm not entirely sure how to identify what part is causing the issue.  My initial thought was RAM.  So I tried to run Windows Memory Diagnostic, but every time I try to run it, I get a blue screen with a \"Power driver state error\".  Then, the PC restarts itself and things boot up like normal, only I don't get the memory diagnostic results in, and my PC continues its lagging after anywhere from 10-30 minutes later.  I've checked my SSD using Crystaldisk and I don't believe that it's the issue.  Nothing in the PC is getting unusually hot to my knowledge, nor does CPU usage spike when the lagging starts.\n\nMy specs are as follows.  Apologies if I miss anything important, I'm not super well versed when it comes to this stuff.\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X\n\nMB: MPG X570 GAMING EDGE WIFI\n\nRAM: 16GB 3200 DDR4\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\nOS: Windows 10 Home",

I noticed things were very quiet, but dismissed it at first because several years of dust had been cleaned out. After a day, I realised the fan at the back of the case (exhaust fan?) wasn't spinning. I've tried cleaning it out and checking it was plugged into the motherboard properly, but it only started to spin when I gave it a nudge with my finger. The speed doesn't seem to change though.\n\nA google search suggested that the voltage/rpm was too low to start the fan and I could fix that in the bios settings. I do remember the technician bringing the bios up on the screen when he changed my power supply so it might be worth trying. I'm running Windows 10 and some sites say push F12 on startup while others say go into the UEFI settings in the advanced options?  Not sure which it is.\n\nAlso, I have literally never touched the bios settings so I'm not sure what to do. Is there a restore to default button? Isn't the fan speed supposed to change based on the temperature? Will changing things in the bios mean the fans will run constantly at the speed I select?\n\nI mostly watch youtube and Netflix with occasional image editing and drawing on a tablet so if there's no default, what would be a good speed to set it at?\n\nSorry for being so technologically illiterate.

Or it's dynamically modifying the speed to suit load?\n\nThese were bought as matched sticks bought in pairs (2x16GB), x2.\n\n`$dmidecode --type memoryMemory DeviceArray Handle: 0x0048Error Information Handle: Not ProvidedTotal Width: 72 bitsData Width: 64 bitsSize: 16384 MBForm Factor: DIMMSet: NoneLocator: DIMM_A1Bank Locator: NODE 1Type: DDR4Type Detail: SynchronousSpeed: 2133 MT/sManufacturer: CorsairSerial Number: 00000000Asset Tag:Part Number: CMK32GX4M2B3200C16Rank: 2Configured Memory Speed: 2133 MT/sMinimum Voltage: 1.2 VMaximum Voltage: 1.2 VConfigured Voltage: 1.2 V`\n\n`$ sudo lshw -short -C memory[sudo] password for moa:` \u00a0`H/W path \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Device \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Class \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description=============================================================/0/0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a064KiB BIOS/0/48 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a064GiB System Memory/0/48/0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016GiB DIMM DDR4 Synchronous 2133 MHz (0.5 ns)/0/48/1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DIMM Synchronous [empty]/0/48/2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016GiB DIMM DDR4 Synchronous 2133 MHz (0.5 ns)/0/48/3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DIMM Synchronous [empty]/0/48/4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016GiB DIMM DDR4 Synchronous 2133 MHz (0.5 ns)/0/48/5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DIMM Synchronous [empty]/0/48/6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016GiB DIMM DDR4 Synchronous 2133 MHz (0.5 ns)/0/48/7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DIMM Synchronous [empty]/0/56 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0896KiB L1 cache/0/57 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a014MiB L2 cache/0/58 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a019MiB L3 cache/0/100/1f.2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0memory \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memory controller`",

    "text": "I got a new laptop, MSI Creator Z16 Windows 10 (model A11UET-013). Since I got the laptop I have noticed 2 issues with the audio. \n\n1. One is that the sound pops whenever a piece of audio starts or stops. Like when I'm on youtube and I click back to the homepage while watching a video, I'll hear the pop. Normally this wouldn't be a big issue, but when I'm a playing a game that doesn't have background music, it gets pretty annoying as I'll hear constant popping as I just click through menus. This issue persists even while wearing headphones.\n\n2. A similar issue is that when watching certain videos, particular twitch streams, I will hear a low volume intermittent crackling noise about every second. The volume is not proportional to the volume of the audio I have set, so it's easiest to hear when I have the volume set to lowest. Interestingly this crackling sound I don't hear when wearing headphones.\n\nI tried to use latencymon to find the issue, and have posted the result https://imgur.com/a/Mpeivst\n\nIt will be running fine on latencymon, but eventually I'll see the above message. But I have no idea how to use the program to identify the culprit or even if the message it gives me has anything to do with my audio issues.\n\nList of things I have tried that I read:\n-Going into device manager, uninstalling the Realtek sound driver, and restarting\n\n-I tried uninstalling the realtek driver, and downloading the driver from the MSI website\n\n-Using the device manager to update the realtek driver to the \"Realtek High Definition Audio\" driver\n\n-Going to the speakers properties, disabling all enhancements and unchecking the boxes under \"exclusive mode\"\n\n-In speakers properties I tried changing the Default format for sample rate and bit depth to the lowest (16 bit, CD quality)\n\n-In the windows setting I tried running the audio troubleshooter\n\n-Updating windows\n\n-Going into services.msc and disabling nahimic (I'm not sure if nahimic is still running. I still see it in my taskbar and running my background processes. But when I click on the icon in the taskbar, it just takes me to a Microsoft store app page)\n\n-I went into device manager and disabled NVIDIA High Definition Audio\n\n-Updating the graphics card driver from the NVIDIA website\n\nI don't know what else I can try and am not sure I should just replace the laptop. Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks!",

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling just about everything, all my usb devices, vive software, I even reinstalled windows. Finally I have boiled down the problem and figured out that I am missing the USB drivers for the vive. Just one small problem - the only way (as far as I know) to get these drivers is to have them automatically installed by Windows when you plug it in. But this is just not happening. No matter what I do or what guides I follow, nothing works. Like I said, I even reinstalled windows, but it just doesn't do what it's supposed to.  Really not sure what else I can do at this point, so if anyone has suggestions please let me know and if you need further info I can provide it. Thanks!",

I'm not tech-savvy.\n\nMy TV is a \"Philips 70\" LED-TV 70PUS7304\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know how to explain this problem other than to hopefully convey enough in the videos.\n\nAll I know is that it has to do with motion. Just some kind of motion blur effect. Everything that moves fast enough across the screen creates this dragged afterimage or fade-effect behind *and* infront of it. Playing [Astros Playroom to show.](https://imgur.com/1As7SeX) Dark lines on the wall shows a good example.\n\nFor [reference](https://imgur.com/jhzCwCe), I recorded this video of the exact same area in the game, on a 27\" TV, probably 8-10 years older than my newer one, and it does *not* have this problem.\n\nDarker areas, shadows, lines or just about anything that is a bit darker than other parts of the screen will look terrible because of this. It might look suddle in the videos, but trust me- it is a hell of a lot worse seen IRL. Very distracting. So distracting in fact that I am desperate of a fix for this, hence why I'm now looking for help online.\n\nI played some Elden Ring (no spoilers) in the [third video](https://imgur.com/fANaJR6) just to show what happens with the darker parts when moving the camera and stopping it. It has this flickering/blinking effect in all darker areas. Unfortunately, it barely shows up because of the quality in the video, but it's there- *OH*, *it's there.*\n\nI feel like I've tried changing and experimenting with every type of picture setting in the TV menu to see if this problem goes away, but... unlucky. IS this something that can actually be fixed in the TV settings, or is it a malfunctioning issue?\n\nThanks in advance if you take the time to review my problem :)",

The test still showed it passing however. Running the tests multiple times yielded similar results.\n\nI am concerned as I initially thought this is normal behavior, but when I was running the same test on my older HP Omen (7700hq/gtx 1050) to be sure, the test ran without any issues at all with no static screens etc.\n\nThe static screen is similar to the one shown in this post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/63k6uo/colorful_static_screen/\n\nShould I be concerned?

    "text": "Hi y'all. The caption sums up the whole issue, but of course I'm gonna fill you in more:\n\nI got a new headset on Christmas. The new headset is Logitech Pro X, and for me to tweak the settings like EQ more, I installed Logitech G Hub on my laptop. I started working on the new set, setting up the EQ and surround sound so they sounded good while I was playing my games; and they did, but I immediately ran into problems.\n\nOne of my favorite games, PayDay 2 started to suffer from FPS drops, and they were bad. Before Christmas and my new headset, I got stable 55-60 FPS, and now it had dropped to 10-20. I checked my mods that I had when the game ran well, and they were all up to date, so I don't think they are the problem. I do have 2 sound mods, but I don't believe they could cause this, or maybe they could, I don't know. So PD2 is pretty much unplayable now because it runs so badly. I have tried to make it run better, but nothing works.\n\nOn to the next game that I have problems with: Call of Chernobyl (mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat). It still runs well unlike PD2, but there is a problem; the sound crackles and when it does it, my game starts to stutter. The crackling can last from a sec to over 10 seconds. Sometimes I have to close the game and open it again for the crackling to calm down. I've checked many times that all the cords and stuff are plugged in well, so they aren't the problem. I'm quite sure that I've found the culprit for this problem tho, and it's the headset's surround sound system. Turning it off stops the crackling, but then again I'd love to use it because it sounds good. CoC itself has two sound devices: Generic Software and OpenAL. I've tried OpenAL, it's a really good surround sound system but unfortunately I can't use it because of two fatal crashes it has, one of them which makes the game unplayable. So I use Generic Software. \n\nAs of now I don't use the headset's surround sound system at all; instead I've tested Window's own (I think it's called Sonic). PD2 still runs like shit, but CoC hasn't crackled, but then again I have played with Window's surround sound just about 10-20 mins. \n\nSo my questions are: is Pro X/G Hub behind my performance problems with PD2? If not, what can the problem be? It ran so well before when I used my Logitech G430-headset, I myself can't find any other culprit. I know that CoC and Pro X's surround system have a beef of some kind, but is there a way to fix it? Or could it be that my Pro X has been defective the day they were bought, which makes it cause problems? I'm so lost with these problems, especially with PD2. I'd love any help. \n\nIf you need more info, ask me. I tried to include everything that I felt necessary. Also I'm not a tech genius, so if you'd like to recommend for me to do something a bit more complex, I'd appreciate guides for it. \n\nOne last thing I want to point out: my EQ-settings aren't high on any game. I tweaked them only a little, and tweaking them down even more hasn't helped.",

Before I did this I tested both ram sticks with dual channel and it worked fine with my build so I proceeded to clean all the fans including the cpu fan. I put all the components back and turned on to see if everything was working. During cleaning I did not touch any of the ram sticks. \nI didn't get a post and saw the 4 flashing amber lights.I quickly looked up the error and found it was a memory problem. I checked to see if I installed the ram sticks incorrectly and even reseated them. Still nothing so I began to troubleshoot. First I checked if my gpu may have died so I swapped gpu and still had nothing posting. I also made sure everything was connected and decided to check if the ram sticks I got had somehow gone dead. So I took out one ram stick out and checked and it managed to boot up. I checked the other and the same which then made me think that my motherboard no longer supports dual channel. \n\nI decided to check if any bios update were available and quickly installed it. I checked again and nothing. I also decided to reset bios by removing the battery and still nothing. I also read that sometimes the cpu fan being installed too tight was a cause so I loosened it a bit and still nothing.I even checked if cpu may have had a pin damaged but fortunately no pins were damaged. I\u2019m not sure if the second slot may be dead or know if there is a way to test this but would like to know if there is reason to why this may had happened and any other troubleshooting method available.",

I can't figure out how to use this cert with the current user (or at all) to decrypt the files.\n\nSystem: Windows 10 Pro\n\nLonger story:\n\nI have a bunch of files inside a Veracrypt volume that I can no longer access (more recent ones are readable, but anything older than 6 months is not). I thought it was just a permissions issue or a corruption issue, but after playing around with it for a while, I realized the inaccessible subset of the files actually has windows file encryption turned on. When I looked at the details of it, the certificate used to encrypt the files was issued to \"Me@OLD-PC-NAME\" and the only available user (and cert) now is \"Me@NEW-PC-NAME\". (names edited for obvious reasons)\n\nBasically, I upgraded my PC in-place about 6 months ago (new mobo/CPU/boot disk and kept everything else including the install, including copying and expanding the volume to the new boot disk). I think in the process, it seems it changed my PC name to something generic (ie DESKTOP-ABC12345), so the user the certificate was issued to functionally no longer exists, even though it was my same account.\n\nI went through MCC and searched through the available certificates and found the certificate for the prior user. I've exported it and backed it up. I also fortunately have backups of the encrypted volume should anything bad happen to it in the process.\n\nBut I have no idea where to go from here. Trying to reimport the certificate seems to just add it to the non-existent user? I'm pretty adept at tech support but this one is definitely beyond my experience. A lot of the stuff I'm reading about online is talking about AD and enterprise features I know nothing about. There's some software out there but I'm not sure what's trustable and a lot of it is pretty expensive. Is it possible to recreate the non existent user if I rename my PC to the old name? I feel like windows is a bit too smart for that.  Anyone have any idea what to do here?",

So basically I went on twitter on my phone and noticed that my profile pic and display name has been changed to of someone else's twitter name and  profile pic, but something was off. I noticed that the name was misspelt a little and the profile pic was a lot lower quality like it was compressed a bunch. The name of my display was changed to Coni Buraeu, which I noticed from the suggested followings was almost identical to someone by the name of Coin Bureau. I've never heard of this person in my life before all this. I did a bunch of scans on my computer to make sure I didn't have a virus and nothing was found. Also, my twitter got suspended because of it, checked my emails and there's no record of it being suspended, no reason at all. I've talked to a friend of mine who has some experience with this kind of stuff, and he says that I may have a rat. I just hope that's not true, and was just hoping for some insight from you guys. None of my other accounts have been touched (so far) so it seems to just be isolated to my twitter account. It's just so weird to me because I barely use twitter.

I was led to believe as long as they were the same brand/type and underclocked it would be okay. Even then with mismatched sized RAM it worked perfectly fine for a while, a month or so until it started to reboot itself like crazy. I eventually bought 2 more 16 GB RAM sticks. Once all the sticks of RAM matched it went away for the most part. It would randomly try to reboot every so often, but not a ton. It does not matter if I am doing extensive gaming or literally nothing, the self-boot has been occurring. I tried to update the BIOS and underclock the RAM/CPU. But I do not know if that has helped or hindered at all. Today for the first time when it failed to boot the VGA light came on and stayed on. It has also rebooted itself before, and instead of failing, it successfully rebooted. I do not want to live my life in fear of the random reboot. All my parts were new, and the specs are as follows: MSI X570 TOMOHAWK WIFI motherboard: RM850x corsair PSU: RTX 3060 ZOTAC gaming:  AMD RYZEN 9 5900 X: CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 4 x 16. When it fails to boot the fans continuously spin, and no lights appear on the motherboard, other than today when the VGA light came on for the first and only time.

But I still want to know if there\u2019s a solution.\n\nSo, is this problem resolvable?\n\nSorry for this wall text and for my bad english.",

After returning to the US and switching SIM cards, everything worked as usual until two months later when the call function has stopped working. I can still text and use data (At&amp;T). When people call me, they get a busy tone. During a three hour long troubleshooting session at AT&amp;T, we discovered a warning stating my SIM is stolen property. Replacing the SIM fixed nothing, in fact, I even lost all data connection. Why is this happening? Is it related to AT&amp;T? Samsung region lock? Will changing providers fix the issue? \n\nIn sum, here's what we know:\n\n- Phone can text and use data, but calling (making and accepting) is broken. \n- Those that call me get a busy tone\n- Changing SIM cards results in a total loss of cellular connectivity\n- There is a stolen property warning in my AT&amp;T account (which the store sees)\n- AT&amp;T support tried multiple ways to \"signal\" my phone, to no avail\n- various restarts, airplane mode, reset connection settings, etc. have done nothing. \n\nTheories: could this have something to do with Samsung's region lock? I unfortunately have no way to call Samsung support since the call function is busted. I originally thought this was an AT&amp;T problem, but since none of their fixes are working I am leaning towards the Samsung side of things. \n\nAny suggestions, possible fixes, or knowledge you may have on this issue would be enormously helpful.

Since then, I've replaced the power supply, the storage system, the ram, the motherboard, AND I've gotten a new CPU yet I'm seeing the same issue. Every time I attempt to open or load a program at all, the PC instantly black screens and restarts itself. I'm at a complete loss and I have no clue what to do. The only thing I can think of now is the GPU but that's completely healthy so I'm stumped. If anyone has any clue what could be happening, I'd appreciate any and all help!\n\nEdit: I still haven't managed to solve the issue and I've tried everything I could think of. The second I attempt to install any programs, the PC immediately restarts without warning. As if there's a complete power loss. The issue is that everything in my PC is new so I can't fathom why this is occuring at all",

    "text": "Recently I have been noticing a microphone icon being present in the corner of my taskbar. This is of course nothing strange at all, when I am in a discord call with my friends. However I've been noticing the same microphone icon comes up again on my Taskbar even when i'm not in a call and i'm just casually on my computer. It began first when Xbox Game Bar kept giving me a notice to the right of the screen that said \"Microphone is now recording\" everytime I opened a new chrome tab. I shut down my microphone and tried to disable my mic for Xbox game bar in the settings. I later enabled my microphone and the xbox game bar's access to using my microphone and after that I didn't really experience anything more until I noticed a microphone icon always being in the corner of my taskbar. When I hover over the icon it tells me \"Host Process for Windows Services is using your microphone\". I restarted my computer several times and I tried different solutions to stop it from listening and weirdly enough it seems like everytime I open up Google chrome the microphone and message returns on my taskbar. \n\nWhen I look in the settings it tells me \"currently in use\" below the Host Process for Windows Services. I opened up Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox to see if Host Process would react to it but nothing happened. Is this a bug? Some people might find this ironic but is Google listening to me? However it's a Windows Process so I find it unlikely but then again at the moment I don't know myself.\n\nBasically right now from what I've gathered, it starts listening to my microphone when I open up google chrome but if I close down the chrome tab it stops listening. Sometimes it stops listening by me just opening another app. I searched for a solution because I didn't feel safe if something actually was listening to my mic. Every answer I found on the internet were all the same and didn't help my case. They were solutions for people that constantly saw the icon and not by opening a chrome tab. Every solution said to uncheck \"Listen to this device\" in the Control panel &lt; sound &lt; recording &lt; listen tab. When I tried to the same it was already unchecked? Lastly I ran two full scans with Microsoft Defender and it told me there was no harm found. \n\nThis brings me to where I am now and let me tell you I am highly confused. I even looked around to see if there potentially was a keylogger installed on my computer by looking at the task manager but from what I've seen so far, it seems pretty safe to say I don't have one installed. (hopefully not.) \n\nI am now asking if anyone knows if there's a solution to fix this because I am completely numb of ideas. Could this be a google extension spying on me or possibly malwares? Is it possibly just a windows bug? **Any help is appreaciated. Cheers!**",

The only fix I have found is with the other person reconnecting to the call or relaunching the client.\n\nDoes anyone know why this is occurring? Is there something preventative measure to take to ensure it doesn't happen again? Why can they still hear the faint sounds from my end but not what my microphone is picking up? Is it something that I'm doing that causes the issue or is it just a random unavoidable issue? Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "I found an old external eSATA enclosure from 2007 while cleaning up. It's been in a closet for 15 years. I forgot I had it. \n\nThe brand is \"CFI\" and it's called a \n&gt; eSATA Terrabox + Port Multiplier\n\n&gt; Raid 0/1+Hot Spare / 5+Hot spare /10\n\n&gt; Sata II 3.0gbs bandwidth.\n\n&gt; Hot Swap Backplane for easy installation.\n\nIt looks pretty close to [this](https://www.newegg.com/cfi-b4043ergg/p/N82E16816855007).\n\nIt claims on the box to use a design based on the Silicon Image Sil3726 controller. It has 4x 3.5\" drive bays in a similar design to most 4 drive NAS boxes, if a little bit harder to mount the drives, as it lacks drive caddies, and requires the case to be removed to install the drives.\n\nIt's box has never been opened and I thought I'd try to save it from the dump.\n\nIt came with a PCI-E eSATA card, eSATA cable, CD with drivers, and power cord. I've also got a spare 4TB drive to test it with. Everything I need to get it working.\n\nOf coarse I wouldn't be posting if it worked out of the box, so here's what I did:\n\nFirst I installed the PCI-E eSATA card into [My PC's](https://i.imgur.com/91ku6mt.png) motherboard's 1x slot. BIOS detected that card as \"PCI-E 1.0 1x\". The card is labelled \"[LG56CM1](https://i.imgur.com/1mWKd4v.png)\".\n\nWindows 10 detected the card and installed a driver called \"Silicon Image Sil 3132 SoftRaid 5 Controller\".\n\nI haven't tried to install the software from the CD as I don't have a CD reader.\n\nI installed a 4TB 3.5\" drive in the enclosure's drive slot 1 and connected the eSATA cable to the eSATA PCI-E card. Turned on the enclosure and then my PC.\n\nOnce into Windows Desktop, I checked Device Manager and the driver reported it was [working correctly](https://i.imgur.com/H5WtpTk.png). The driver also [reported finding the 4TB drive](https://i.imgur.com/bDGZanJ.png).\nThen I went into Disk Management and a [new drive was displayed](https://i.imgur.com/DHfcYsU.png).\n\nI tried to [initialize the drive](https://i.imgur.com/95jz3tu.png). But it failed with [an error](https://i.imgur.com/9k7uLzP.png).\n\nThe manufacturer of the enclosure, appears to be [CFI](https://www.chyangfun.com/product/) in Taiwan but has no mention of this old enclosure and may not still be in business as their website hasn't been updated in 3 years. I've emailed their support but aren't hopeful for a reply.\n\nSilicon Image seems to have been taken over by another company and there's no results for drivers on it's [website](https://www.latticesemi.com/).\n\n**Any suggestions?**\n\nI fear that this enclosure may be too old to work with current systems. I'd rather not toss it, but if I can't get it working, I'll just get an external USB3.0 enclosure for my drives.",

    "text": "The machine in question is estimated to be 6 years old (can't confirm how old it actually is since the original owner is obnoxiously drunk right now). It's running Windows 10, installed on an SSD.\n\nAfter factory-resetting it and hauling it across the city, it has so far passed out twice for no clear reason with the blue screen showing \"INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE\". It came back to life when I opened the desktop and jiggled all the cables three days ago, but just today the same thing happened again with the same error code.\n\nWhat steps can I take to verify that this is a cables issue, an SSD issue, or something else?\n\n---\n\nMore context...\n\nI have been using it for ~5 years until late last year, when I came across a pretty nifty deal and got myself a new machine. I bought it off a friend of mine who paid for it with his first paycheck, which ended up being his last as the position. Now that another friend needed a gaming machine, I decided to give the old one to her.\n\nI used Win10's native factory reset feature and cleaned the interior with compressed air. The cab driver was considerate enough to drive at the speed limit, but I'm wondering if the machine bumped into something while I was looking away. Anyways, it had been kind to me throughout its stay with me,  so I might have been careless. \ud83d\ude14\n\nWhile I was at friend's place, I tested it and it worked all right for the first hour. We set it to download core security app installers while chatting... and then the machine froze for about a minute (oddly the mouse cursor was responsive?). The screen then showed us a blue screen with the code being INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE. I'm not exactly a tech person but I could tell that was scarier than usual.\n\nUpon reboot, the computer could not detect the SSD that had Windows installed on. It requested a boot disk at first. BIOS did not show that it detected the SSD either. My suspicion at the moment was that either the SSD was damaged for some mystical reason or cables got loose during transit.\n\nSince the latter was easier to confirm, I opened the desktop and jiggled all the cables connected to the storage drives back on. I couldn't tell if any were loose, but after that it went back to being okay...\n\nThree days later, I got a message saying that the machine showed my friend the same blue screen out of the blue and refused to boot back. She's less confident with hardware stuff than me so I'll have to visit her again. \ud83d\ude15\n\nWhile I'm there, though, it might do us good to prepare. Is there a way to confirm whether the problem is with the cables or the SSD? Shimmying the cables fixed the problem the first time, so I get the impression that that's the issue, but I've also read that SSDs can be finicky and may randomly die without casually noticeable signs of degradation.\n\nIf there's a reasonable possibility that it's an SSD issue &amp; it's possible to get it running again, what diagnostic tool should I use to determine the SSD's health?\n\nI would ask the exact specs from the friend that actually bought the thing, but his new boss dragged him off to a janky bar and he's drunk four bottles of beer and unaccounted-for bottles of soju.",
